Spooky Kevin

44
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
Let's talk about

45
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
Hearables

46
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,192
We've talked about this before we had a guest in April

47
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
That was a fun conversation

48
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,800
Talk about perception

49
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
Sounded

50
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,920
All the kind of things you could actually cream into her hair bows and then you pointed out this

51
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,736
Fast Company article on Doppler Labs switch

52
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:02,368
It's no longer around but it's not it's not but it had a lot of influence on what's happening with

53
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
Apple

54
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
Google and Amazon these days

55
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,584
For those who are not familiar with Doppler labs they came out with the here one wireless earbuds and

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
News for traditional music

57
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
Earbuds

58
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,728
Also they could amplify external noise could even

59
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,080
Translate languages in your ear so you can have a conversation in another country

60
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
Criminal law

61
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
Into these little earbuds

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,480
But they face the challenge that many new hardware devices

63
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
Space battery life is

64
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,344
Really tricky when you have such a small things that isn't your bud

65
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,744
And you're cramming all kinds of processing power into the earbuds so you're right they're not here anymore even folks friendly with

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
Froggy or Froggie

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
They had the dash headphones that were very similar and just like the here ones the reviews were just terrible bragi

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
Is now licensing Airsoft

69
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,288
Are so but yeah this is a good article because it really shows the influence

70
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,080
What I think is

71
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
And I don't know if you agree but

72
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,688
Maybe the next big wearable type device that

73
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
We are

74
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,248
Looking at once week workouts

75
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,064
Some Kinks yes I totally agree in what

76
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
More I think

77
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
This is kind of the few

78
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
Future and not just because I loved

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
The movie Her

80
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
I think

81
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
We've been very focused on screen

82
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
For good reason

83
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,352
And we still are I mean even if we look at things things like Google Glass

84
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,656
Heads-up displays it's very screen Centric

85
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
But I think

86
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
We could do a lot

87
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
With

88
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
Information

89
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Delivered

90
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,848
Audibly over-the-ear and maybe with like a

91
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
Companion haptic

92
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
So

93
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
Maya mean

94
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,992
Think about things like directions like when you're walking around

95
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
The city and you're just like

96
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,624
You're hearing from the phone that you're looking at the phone to see where you turn right or left but

97
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
Having a device that

98
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
I can just say

99
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
Turn right here

100
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
That's amazing

101
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Having

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
A device

103
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,560
You can just ask a question of

104
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,192
Then get the answer we have that in our homes so putting that inner ear for travel purposes

105
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
Makes a lot of sense

106
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,080
It doesn't actually work getting there already and those two particular instances

107
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,688
For example when I wear my Apple watch when I get directions and walking around town where you when I'm driving

108
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
When I get to

109
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,784
Turn in the direction C it will give me a haptic feedback

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832
In advance of it will be like two beeps

111
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:14,464
Go to buses for laughed and three for a ride so I'm already starting to get that in certain places with the Apple watch

112
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
And there are

113
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
Various headphones

114
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,863
What's that have built-in Google assistant or Madam a

115
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,167
Siri for example that give you information

116
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,567
What's nice about it is you're right it's like a whisper in your ear nobody else knows that you're getting that information I think that's part of the next step

117
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
Stop here right we don't want

118
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,895
Distracting type interactions

119
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
Yes baby will stop walking

120
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
In the manholes

121
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
Because that is a thing that happens

122
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,831
I'm excited about this and then there's the next level which is

123
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,391
Hey I'm getting kind of old and

124
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
My hearing is maybe not

125
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Is awesome is it

126
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Used to be

127
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
So having a device that can

128
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,583
Help me hear what I need to hear in May

129
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,631
Fade Out background conversations

130
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
That's really

131
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Compelling

132
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:01,823
And I'm raising my hand because I actually fit into that category I have problems hearing things when there's a lot of background noise

133
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,895
So when my family watching TV and talking to me

134
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,455
I can't understand them so I actually did buy

135
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,575
Acorn horrible from nuheara earlier this year the eye cubits and

136
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,367
Again they function as a music player

137
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:20,767
And they also amplify sound so I can like sit and watch my TV in my office and not have it blurry

138
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:25,375
Hearing so I can hear it because it drowns out the girls watching TV downstairs and I turn to a normal level

139
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
I just wear the iqbuds

140
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
What

141
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
What

142
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Yeah

143
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Except

144
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
I had to

145
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,847
So the point is in the reason why were talking about it on the show is cuz

146
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
I really believe that this is going to be

147
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
I'm just saying the Next Generation

148
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Computing platform

149
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:44,831
The challenges we're going to have to come up with is figuring out battery life

150
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
Things like wireless charging

151
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:52,511
Only go so far I have some wireless headphones that do last for 5 hours cuz they don't do anything

152
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,071
But

153
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
Charging them in the charging cases

154
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,679
It's fairly simple so figuring out a way to

155
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,751
Compensate for poor battery life doing things like

156
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,055
Betteredge kind of processing

157
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,847
Power that Stila

158
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
Thing that needs to happen

159
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
What else might we need

160
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,503
I think better life is the Big Challenge because again it's it's just

161
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
Space limitation

162
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
Write the computing

163
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,879
Either you're going to need to cram more and more into smaller

164
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Chips

165
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,999
But that's a given that's happening that's pretty standard with any Computing platform

166
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,791
There is a technology

167
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,327
For hearing aids

168
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
So it's called probabilistic

169
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,471
And the idea is instead of computing on every 011

170
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,007
You computer to slightly less

171
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
Accurate rate to save on energy

172
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
Very simplistic way of

173
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
But it is a known technology that

174
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
I've been researching

175
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
The challenges

176
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Doing that at

177
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Scale

178
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,319
Requires a device that is sold at

179
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,159
So I'd be curious as we see major manufacturers

180
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Like Apple

181
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
Ace Hardware Samsung

182
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:00,351
Will they find enough use for something like that to basically create a whole new type of

183
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
Computing platform

184
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,215
I think so and I just say that because

185
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:11,615
Have your very first point about getting away from screens voices the new user interface these days but there are times when voice doesn't make sense

186
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
Cenote if your assistance going to announce

187
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,967
Personal information now so the world will that kind of

188
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,575
Stinks so I think we're getting away from the screens and this is the next

189
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
Spread your next

190
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,671
Step to add information to you in a non-intrusive way

191
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,463
So I do think there's definitely

192
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
And I suspect there that's appealing

193
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
And additionally just

194
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,631
Going back to the hearing assistance new hearing aids

195
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
Expensive

196
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:41,055
You talking several thousand dollars I didn't look and see how long the batteries last I know they all have replaceable batteries with us app

197
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,151
There's a whole new category for these horrible is called

198
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,967
Personal sound amplification products for peace out

199
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
And that's

200
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,039
What I bought that's worth a lot of these things are

201
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,807
They're not

202
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
Subject to FDA

203
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
Regulation

204
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
And that's important because

205
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,463
Anybody can buy them over the counter

206
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,279
I wonder what the impact is going to be for

207
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,815
The hearing aid industry as a result

208
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
You should listen to that podcast for back

209
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
We do talk about

210
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,215
Is her name number

211
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
Yes she was

212
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Okay

213
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
Well

214
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,871
I don't think we're going to solve the hero's power problem anytime soon but

215
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,199
Keep an eye out I know Kevin and I have been for a while

216
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
Just keep an eye out for these kind of innovation

217
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:26,111
Cuz they are coming and they're going to creep up on us

218
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Who called the iPhone

219
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
Echo

220
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,071
Okay I don't think we never talk to each other again

221
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
Maybe we

222
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Next up

223
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Apple

224
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
Joined the thread group

225
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
What did you think about that

226
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
I think it's

227
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,127
Big potential news for homekit because it opens up

228
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
The door to other

229
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
Radio protocol

230
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,039
For homekit devices cuz right now it's just Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

231
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
It's

232
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,415
I mean apples every deliberate they don't join groups or standards that they don't plan to use

233
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:06,047
I didn't just join the third group they are a sponsor top-tier level they're on the board of directors now

234
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,119
The pan of sum of money each year now so

235
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
I suspect

236
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,959
They will use thread the question is with what and how

237
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
Yes so in this

238
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
I was super excited about big

239
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,615
As you've mentioned before Kevin

240
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,407
Right now punk it is only

241
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

242
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,551
And that leaves out a chunk of devices and that's why we've got hubs for like our

243
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Hue light bulbs

244
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
That sort of thing

245
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
With

246
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,695
Thread which uses the same underlying radio as

247
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Zippy

248
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:39,071
802. 15.4 what could happen is maybe we'd Co

249
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
Apple supporting

250
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,447
That radio protocol which means maybe we could get pure hubs in our lives

251
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
The alternative

252
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
Because I have seen

253
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,055
Arm actually a couple years ago showed

254
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
Thread over Bluetooth radio

255
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,407
And I talk to other chipmakers

256
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,455
To have experimental but don't have

257
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
Production stuff

258
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Read over

259
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Wi-Fi

260
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Radios

261
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,135
So it could open us up two more protocols but it also might just be like

262
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,231
Same stuff but now you've got direct IP access

263
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Which is one of the things

264
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
What's the thread is both a mesh protocol

265
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,631
It's low power and its IPv6

266
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Capable

267
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
Which means you go Direct

268
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
Write what I

269
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,007
I would hope for assuming

270
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Apple does

271
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
Use this for zigbee devices

272
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
What that would do

273
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
What is manufacturers would not have to make

274
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,247
Two versions of devices right now there are some door locks

275
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,039
Example there's a virgin

276
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
There's a home cover

277
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,415
That's a challenge for the smaller device makers right so it's limited

278
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,975
The number of devices that you have available for

279
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,047
Choice in home care if they were to adopt

280
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Zigbee

281
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
With thread

282
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,911
Then that would make life a lot easier for

283
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Consumer stand for device

284
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,239
Yeah because I did a lot of

285
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
Consumers have to choose their like

286
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,735
Yes a limited class of device but I also have devices that they may not work with other smart home hubs so

287
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
Let's see what happens

288
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,623
My hope is that we're going to see some interesting things so you know I dog an apple

289
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
A lot for

290
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,231
It is Well executed but it is so limited and it is

291
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
So brutal to be at home

292
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
Kit partner

293
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:18,399
They're slow and steady approach the the smartphone market has not evolved

294
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
The way I thought it was

295
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,495
In the way I hoped it would because I am an open internet

296
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,287
So it's possible that

297
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
Who is still come out from this sin

298
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Be just fine

299
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,663
It's taken a long time but here I agree

300
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
Very possible they will

301
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,039
Really expand homekit more than they have in the prior-year so

302
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,855
Yeah we'll see who knows maybe I'll be Maricopa

303
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
It is

304
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,487
So let's move on from the Smart Home

305
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
To some

306
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
Industrial and

307
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Enterprise

308
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,423
Okay so this week Bane

309
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
One of the big consulting firms

310
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
Put out a report noting that the iot

311
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
She is

312
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:02,687
Hey it's a big deal the most notable number that you're seeing everywhere is that it is going to be a 502

313
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
20 billion dollar market

314
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,551
That will be by 2021

315
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
It's going to be more than double the

316
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:14,207
235 billion that was spent last year on iot Hardware software

317
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,999
System integration and

318
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
Telecom services

319
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,887
Like everybody they believe that the Enterprise and Industrial segment circuit

320
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:26,495
Experience the most Revenue growth and they also realized that

321
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,055
Most of the executives they interviewed

322
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,359
600 they are admitting that

323
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Adoption rates

324
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
Are pretty slow

325
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,223
And as someone who follows the space this is

326
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Natsu

327
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
Pricing for the last two years I have seen

328
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
Many of

329
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,671
The company serving the space offering me the exact

330
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
Same

331
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
Customer win

332
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,815
What is happening is I see a few of those customer win

333
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:57,215
Expanding their stuff but I don't see a lot of new customers that are actually expanding so they're still stuck at the

334
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Concept

335
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
They call that the pilot purgatory

336
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:05,663
Yeah and I mean I work for two companies I had over a hundred thousand employees and it was

337
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,063
Any major change or implementation it was like driving an oil tanker you know you took forever to make a turn

338
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,367
There's just so many pieces involving so many

339
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:20,767
Business units that are touched and you got a test everything and get buy-in and also I sort of get that cuz this is like a new frontier

340
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
Here for Enterprise

341
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,607
But what I found interesting in here was

342
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:29,215
Security is on the minds of these people that were interviewed and that's not the surprise of it it's

343
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
The fact that Bane says

344
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,311
These folks would buy more iot devices

345
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,359
And pay more for them if there's

346
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
Security concerns for address

347
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,247
I just asked him how much more would you pay and they said about 22% more on average

348
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,063
Obviously Securities important if we are pain that I ever show

349
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,927
But the fact that they're willing to pay a premium for what I think should really be table Stakes is a very interesting

350
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,207
Can I sing

351
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
It also speaks to an issue with security

352
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,303
Which is people would love to

353
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Payforit

354
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
To go away

355
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,679
Unfortunately security is not something you can throw money at it's actually a

356
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
Process is much as it is a technology

357
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
Socks

358
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,431
I'm not making light of everyone's problem here but it's true you have to train your worker

359
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:15,295
How to behave with this kind of information so they don't get finished or they don't pick up a USB stick in the park

360
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,623
You have to train your vendors to

361
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,439
Issue update said you have to start thinking about that

362
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
When you start sourcing

363
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
Technology

364
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
It's not something you can just

365
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Play 4

366
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,375
So I'm glad people to pay for it but at the same time I think

367
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,703
It's misleading and I would also say another reason

368
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,335
One of the other big reasons are not adopting this technology because they don't see a good Roi

369
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
In quicker

370
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,431
And I think again this is not the type of

371
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,735
Yes there are things that you can do to

372
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
Get an Roi

373
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
And Technology

374
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
This is actually

375
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
How much more foundational shih

376
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,671
So you're going to be putting in technology

377
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:56,255
Overtime but only if

378
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
You understand how

379
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
So

380
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
I get why this

381
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
Is taking a while

382
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
Technically hard

383
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,959
Security concerns but it is something that everyone is going to have to

384
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
Carlos say

385
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,311
In a couple of weeks we will have actually someone

386
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,871
Bane on to talk a little bit more about this so you

387
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,455
Stay tuned for that in the meantime will include a link to the

388
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
Reports you can dig in on

389
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Euro timing

390
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
Share your thoughts

391
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
F sharing thoughts

392
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
Paul a lovely Lister Santa

393
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Iotc

394
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Securities

395
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
Tips from meek

396
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Magazine

397
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
So Paul thank you so much for doing this

398
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Play Love make

399
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,167
And this is for people who are building

400
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Their own

401
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
Smart home systems and

402
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,519
Reddit homebridge on a pie

403
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
Will include a link to it some of its really easy

404
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,919
Hey all raspbian OS installed

405
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,711
Password for the default Pi use

406
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
You should change that

407
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Another

408
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
Keep your OS up today

409
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
That makes sense

410
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
It's going to be secure

411
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
And some of these are a little bit more

412
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,511
So disable password login with

413
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
SSH

414
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
I was kind of like

415
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,119
That is not something that I thought about

416
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
Yeah I had to be honest

417
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
I hadn't thought about that

418
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
Nor have I thought

419
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,359
Or tried I should have thought about having tried setting up a firewall and

420
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:20,735
Punching a couple holes in specifically for devices I just haven't had the time to plan that out

421
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
Intuit

422
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
It does make sense

423
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
Yeah you're running a lot of pies

424
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,463
And so that's if you're going to make your own for all of the devices

425
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,047
Prayer things that are not your own device we talk about these all the time

426
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
Which is ya change your passwords

427
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,447
Keeping us up-to-date this goes a little further it says disabled services in protocols you don't

428
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,287
Sometimes you get in trouble when you're trying to do that individually on certain

429
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
Iot devices

430
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
So your device funk

431
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Nationality Maybe

432
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
If you do that but

433
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,967
You know if you're using a VPN

434
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
Is also a lovely

435
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,599
It is and I don't think it's a bad solution but if you

436
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:02,719
Depending on how you implement a VPN and what you use like if you set your whole home

437
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:08,351
Internet off on a VPN and you do streaming services like if you watch MLB TV for example I watch

438
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,911
That's only available in the US so if I have a

439
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:15,775
Different IP address I from Canada I can't watch that service so there's pros and cons to that one

440
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,103
That's true and sometimes with automatic time update

441
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,919
If you're in a different view if your VPN saying you're in a different

442
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Time zone U

443
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,503
You could have your lights wake you up an hour early witch

444
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,087
They also talk about things like using a guest Network

445
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
Talk about that

446
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
I don't love it I actually

447
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
Daycare is an Advertiser in the podcast

448
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,487
But while we were on the phone

449
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Doing the ads

450
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
I did ask about the

451
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
This I was like

452
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
You know guest Networks

453
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Don't work

454
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Look for iot

455
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,727
Actually said that their work

456
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
To make easier

457
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
When that comes out

458
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,615
I don't know but it does give me

459
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
A sense of

460
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Hope that

461
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,223
Maybe the Wi-Fi vendors are going to start taking this seriously

462
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,319
Create easier ways to do guest networks without actually doing

463
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
So

464
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:08,255
Let's move on thank you Paul for that everybody will include a link that actually offers some really good how to

465
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
Make magazine

466
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
Let's talk about

467
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
Some quick new stuff shall we

468
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
We shall

469
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Okay

470
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Big news

471
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,311
On the show The June oven with Kevin and I both own and bought for 1495

472
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
And $95

473
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,455
That is no longer going to be the June

474
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,271
Gentoo oven that is out it is right now

475
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
499

476
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
9 for an undetermined

477
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
Period of time

478
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,927
Or you can buy gourmet package which is

479
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,999
699 and I can chew a bunch of trays

480
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
Recipe service

481
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
I think additional warranty services

482
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887
Eventually the price of the

483
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,423
David will go up to 5

484
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
It hasn't yet

485
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
So we're going to talk

486
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,055
Much more about that but I just wanted to give you guys like

487
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:58,175
This is a smarter oven that we all know and love and if you don't know in love it it basically

488
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,735
Has a camera in it it recognizes your food

489
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,807
It has preset cooking programs it basically makes

490
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Cooking

491
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,671
Yeah we still use ours

492
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,207
At least twice a day

493
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
If not more

494
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,839
Barely use a regular full-size oven as a result and it when I tell my wife about the shoes

495
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
I think we pay like $1,500

496
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Yeah

497
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,959
I said but you know what first-generation product relay doctors

498
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,775
That's life I said the question is do you feel it's worth

499
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,335
I just like yeah we use it all the time that's great

500
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,687
So she's not even upset about the price. I don't know if that's how you feel about it

501
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
You know it is what it is

502
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,271
You know I haven't talked to Matt

503
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
I feel okay about

504
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
I understand

505
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
We held

506
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,415
Kevin we helps make this possible

507
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
This is true

508
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
So

509
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Look at us

510
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
If you guys buy it you can

511
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887
Okay so arm has made

512
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
Acquisition

513
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:55,775
Last week but now it is a done deal arm his arm has a chip license

514
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,567
They bought a company

515
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,847
Called treasure

516
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,687
Data and the idea here is that arm

517
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
Seems to me they also bread

518
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,759
Company called stream

519
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Data

520
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,367
Stop the stacks so instead of doing just

521
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,927
Semiconductor design and Licensing

522
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,463
They're starting to think about life

523
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:20,863
Black data processing in the closer you get to the solving the problem 1 it's going to have a good virtuous cycle on there

524
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,679
Chip designs are going to understand what they need to build

525
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
More butt

526
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
They also

527
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,823
But this was not a lot of people are using it but they also launched a cloud service

528
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,103
Especially I think

529
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,663
2 years ago so it kind of makes sense

530
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
Sit there

531
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
Getting more into Data Manager

532
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,271
Spencer treasure data does data management

533
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,903
Pulling data from a bunch of iot devices and they help you

534
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
Normalize it

535
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
So you know

536
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,303
Since it is also adds another Revenue stream for arm

537
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
And that

538
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,631
With treasure data for the data analytics and

539
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,215
Stream Technologies and arm and bed people who subscribe

540
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,239
Forest Service

541
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Through those

542
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
Entities

543
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:05,407
Will be able management take devices over the clouds so that's a whole new Revenue potential stream for the

544
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Oh that's true

545
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,735
All right so that's the arm news

546
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:15,903
Any smart home news we have a fridge cam coming out from a company in the UK called smarter

547
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,208
Here in the US I don't believe we could order it yet

548
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,512
Very disappointed I saw this at CES

549
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,560
How do you know if it was last year if it was 27

550
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
But

551
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
If you're in the UK

552
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,400
You can buy it for

553
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,472
You can buy it for a hundred and fifty pounds

554
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
Or roughly a hundred pound

555
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
If you buy a

556
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Fridge

557
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,176
I love this because it is a camera you stick in your fridge that also has

558
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
AI is part of it

559
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
They're working with

560
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
UK grocer test

561
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,320
Costco so you can

562
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,368
Get a shopping list based on your

563
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
Fridge contents

564
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,440
And they send that to Tesco and

565
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
Jessica will just

566
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
Chocolate

567
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,792
Pick it up I just really want to be able to open

568
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
My free agency

569
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
I can't open my

570
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
Message and see what's inside

571
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:01,216
I want to be able to get a picture of what's in my fridge so I can

572
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,312
I just want to see if the light really goes off

573
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
It does

574
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
How do you know

575
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,736
Okay so let's see what else do I

576
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,296
Kevin I can't believe we almost didn't talk about this

577
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
Let's talk about

578
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,368
Anki vector

579
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,976
Oh yes the Anki Vector which was announced earlier this week

580
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:28,608
For those who are not familiar maybe you are familiar with the cozmo also made by Anki that

581
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:33,472
That came out I believe in 2016 if that's small little robot is small

582
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:39,104
Sister I don't know 2 or 3 in wide by maybe three maybe four in long is smallfoot

583
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,176
It is the cutest little thing I know it's Stacy you love the

584
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,224
The cosmo personality

585
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
So wonderful

586
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:50,112
It's so endearing that funky I met with them to talk about the new

587
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,928
Devices called Vector they said that people

588
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,976
Sending you know there

589
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,048
I'm sending their Cosmo because it needs me up some maybe something broke on it

590
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
Plastic parts

591
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
Do I get it fixed

592
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,912
And they're like my nephew is miserable at his

593
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:09,312
Cosmo had to come back and please hurry and people get really attached to this because aside from it

594
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,360
Being just at home robot it's really

595
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,384
A companion

596
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,992
So much so that onky has hired somebody from Pixar and they animate

597
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,296
Thousands of expressions and movements in

598
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
It just didn't

599
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:25,440
Those into the robot it's really like a little personality on tread spray

600
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,536
It is and it actually so when you are games you play with

601
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
Cosmo

602
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,352
We'll talk about the old one

603
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,656
The old one and what it would lose

604
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
Was too many times in a row

605
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,728
It would get mad it would like

606
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:41,312
Jamis little it has like a little bulldozer front and we just go

607
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,384
To beat it on the floor and it was

608
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
I mean it was kind of hilarious but

609
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Also

610
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
Just so much

611
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,272
Okay facts about yourself

612
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,064
Vector looks a lot like

613
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,464
Cosmo very very similar maybe even identical it's hard to say exactly I know that they've doubled the amount of parts inside

614
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,512
Lights on the inside cefaly different

615
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,816
Back on the inside is very different because with

616
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,864
Cosmo you had to connect

617
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,680
Chi robot via an app on your phone or tablet and

618
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
A lot of the processing

619
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:13,824
Was actually done on the phone or the tablet that big difference with Vector is

620
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,152
It's all on board and when I say all

621
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
Division is on board

622
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,248
The neural network is on board

623
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:25,088
The mapping is on board natural language processing is on board

624
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,928
It does have a connection to the cloud over your Wi-Fi network

625
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,744
And that is to access its Knowledge Graph

626
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,608
Companies such as Google Amazon have knowledge graphs that their devices tap into for information

627
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,680
Well Vector does the same only its monkeys knowledge

628
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
It moves just like

629
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
The old robots

630
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,312
It actually can tell when it's

631
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,384
Battery is running low to like 10 15%

632
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,920
And it will go back

633
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,736
By itself autonomously to its little charging base

634
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:57,088
I asked them about that makes so you can only use it when it's off the base right

635
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,624
They said no actually

636
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,184
Once the battery runs out goes back on his charger

637
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,488
He still available to listen speak

638
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,328
Ask for information give you the weather will still recognize faces

639
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
It's just that

640
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,912
If you do any movement with a Treads those suck up a lot of juice

641
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
And he may not

642
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:16,544
Come out of his charging pad if you say go across to the front window and tell me who's outside he won't do that

643
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,336
There's person recognition

644
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,128
And there's the everything in there is

645
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,408
All on board

646
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:26,528
Running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip and it's a reasonable price the

647
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:31,136
Cosmo device was 179 this is on Kickstarter

648
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,184
You could have until September 6th

649
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
Tobacco

650
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:38,048
It is 199 is the early bird but when it hits stores in October

651
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,584
It will be 249

652
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,656
Even so yes it's a small little thing is not going to lift

653
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:46,240
Picked up things on your house to bring them to you per se but there's so much

654
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:52,128
Groundbreaking intelligence in this for the price in my opinion that that's why I thought that's what you were talking about

655
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
And

656
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
Are you going to buy one

657
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,248
I am seriously considering I have till September 6

658
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
The early backers will get there

659
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,648
Vector by October 9th it will hit retail stores buy a

660
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,672
October 12th

661
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,000
There is an SDK that if you know some python

662
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,792
You can program it yourself

663
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,864
That comes out in December and that's kind of why I'm interested

664
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,936
Just how much is onboard as well as the SDK because

665
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:21,056
What got me interested in talking in general was I saw a video of somebody using a cosmo

666
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:25,408
Pairing up with Google tensorflow and training it to recognize the difference between a cat

667
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
A dog and

668
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:30,016
Assure example and there another Cosmo go around and say cat

669
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:36,416
Dog cat networks go to the shoe and he would someone directly saw shoe and to me that's fun tinkering and that's what I'd like

670
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,208
I'm leaning towards yes getting on

671
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
Okay

672
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,304
Well then you'll have to send me my Cosmo

673
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
Okay

674
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,936
Two other quick bits of news the FBI is warning

675
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:52,800
Hospitals that their iot devices are being targeted by cybercriminals

676
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,104
This is not surprising we've been talking about it

677
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,920
Sears now but

678
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,968
The FBI's finally Lake.

679
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
Reboot your devices

680
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552
They talked about using antivirus

681
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,136
Isolate your iot devices from other network connection

682
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Basic secure

683
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
The other piece of news

684
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,488
It's worth talking about just

685
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:16,096
Because we wrote about it in the newsletter but we haven't talked about it is Charlie Kindle

686
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
The guy behind

687
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,912
Madam is Smart Home

688
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,680
Efforts

689
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
He's now at

690
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
Control4

691
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
Which is a

692
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
Professionally installed

693
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
Home automation

694
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:28,896
ABK

695
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,480
So I was really excited I talked to Charlie about this

696
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:37,600
And one big takeaway and you can see the interview on the website but the one they take away I thought was interesting

697
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,880
When I asked him

698
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,208
Why go to professional when you've been DIY your whole life

699
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
And he was like

700
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,536
Look there's just a bunch of stuff that

701
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,864
It's just too complicated for consumers that you just can't do

702
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
If you

703
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,936
Are trying to do DIY so like

704
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
Whole home audio

705
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,008
Video of those kind

706
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288
I just really difficult

707
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,104
And I appreciate what he said about

708
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
The fact that both

709
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,920
DIY and

710
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
Professional Home install

711
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
There's a place for both

712
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
In this world in it

713
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:09,088
You know what I think he's right we focus a lot on DIY stuff

714
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,392
But you know what we'd do this stuff we

715
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
Elizabeth

716
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,696
A lot of people are like

717
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,280
I have no idea where to start and I wouldn't even know how to install it

718
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,072
So yeah there's definitely

719
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Placerville

720
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,400
Oh yeah and then the second thing he said

721
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,960
That was worth noting is I asked him

722
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
What kind of

723
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
Technologies he was

724
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,824
Excited about still where the future was still going

725
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
In

726
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128
One of his

727
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:35,712
Topix was voice not recite we got a lot of room to run there

728
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
Not surprised

729
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,040
But the second was actually high quality content

730
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,320
So we pulled out he's like

731
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
You know

732
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
Kind of sucked

733
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,392
Petco dachshund

734
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,720
Compression Technologies for audio and video for a while in the

735
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
Experience has it

736
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,536
Shipping crate so he's looking at things like for Katie

737
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,072
TV better audio codec

738
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,376
And he thinks that's going to actually make a big comeback

739
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
So

740
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:58,496
Maybe I mean my daughter would rather watch something on

741
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,544
YouTube and

742
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
Stream

743
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:05,152
Her Spotify list through the echo so this is not a

744
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,688
High quality experience

745
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,272
Enough about

746
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,040
News

747
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,112

Therefore being

761
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,528
And remember

762
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
Smarter homes

763
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
Start with SLI

764
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
Alright this week's voicemail is from

765
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Noah

766
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
Big eyes

767
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,488
I was wondering if

768
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,024
You know what a federal

769
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,304
It is too large

770
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,328
Harmony is

771
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,888
Use it or automating a lot of

772
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
Like

773
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,520
And then air purifiers my

774
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,312
Old school

775
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,616
TV and I really don't want one anyway

776
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,896
Irregardless

777
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,920
Yes

778
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,760
Like how it's based on profiles and I have to turn one profile

779
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,784
Before I can

780
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,064
Another one

781
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,368
On it gets really messy when I have more

782
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
Places that I want to start

783
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
Or stop at 1

784
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,744
So if there's anything that you guys can see

785
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
Think of or know of

786
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,560
Thanks

787
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,888
Big props to you for using

788
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,912
What I would think

789
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,496
Unconventional technology for this particular use

790
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,312
I our lives like I was like

791
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,640
Instead of a Logitech Harmony he should go with the

792
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Amazon

793
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:45,760
New Kindle block thing this out but then I listened to your voicemail and I was like oh no

794
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
No not freaking

795
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Ceiling fans

796
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,112
Instead I'm going to direct you to

797
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:54,976
A device that I was really excited about probably really last year but

798
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,024
I'm not as excited about now but

799
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,096
It's perfect for what you want this is a device called the bond

800
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,912
It is

801
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:07,520
Is a $99 disc that basically uses Wi-Fi IR

802
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,056
And has RF

803
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:13,408
Capabilities so it will pair with your ceiling fans existing remote

804
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688
Control up to

805
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
6 ceiling

806
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
Score

807
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Six devices

808
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,296
It also works with fireplaces

809
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
The idea is

810
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,880
That you

811
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,672
Lincoln to this device

812
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,744
And then you can control it via Madam a or if

813
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
Or

814
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,304
Dap the bond app

815
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,864
And you don't have to put in like the fancy

816
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,216
Retrofit kits for an existing ceiling fan or replace your entire ceiling fan

817
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
So you know

818
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:43,104
I don't know it works people seem to really like it I hadn't tried it I was excited when they

819
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
Started initially.

820
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
Talking about it because

821
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,456
They said it was going to do more than just

822
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,760
Ir and RF they were going to do other

823
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
Radio frequencies

824
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,600
And I wanted to pair it to my somfy blinds app

825
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
Patozon

826
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Cuz I hate my

827
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,416
My current some people I knew

828
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,440
Cementation butt

829
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
It doesn't have that yet

830
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
So I am sad

831
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,840
Yeah they are looking at bringing support to other devices as well though I say

832
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,376
Think like garage doors and some others

833
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,192
Yes they are right now they only have ceiling

834
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
What's in my hunches

835
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,312
Be on or off

836
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,896
You do need for an IRA if your fans are IRA

837
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,456
Not RF you're going to have to make sure the bond

838
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
Has a clear line of sight to the fan

839
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,552
Which means it's not gonna be able to

840
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
Troll

841
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
IR fans

842
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,416
So that's one thing to know

843
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,464
But it's relatively cheap

844
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,000
If you

845
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,560
Could use it for a couple things then

846
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Crate

847
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,864
Ceiling fans

848
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,240
Controlled by Lutron on off switch so I can actually control the speed this will let you control speeds if you have the speed

849
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
With the remote

850
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,032
So yeah

851
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,056
99 bucks

852
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,456
And that about wraps up the show this week please stay tuned for our guest

853
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,040
June CEO Matt Van Horn he's going to tell us how he

854
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:01,440
Cut so much money off the price of the June and talk about data and food plus he shares a smores recipe

855
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
G4S

856
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
All of it

857
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,816
Coming up after this message from our sponsor

858
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:13,216
Hey everyone we are taking a break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week

859
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Spencer is

860
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,544
Netgear and I have John McHugh

861
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,824
The senior vice president

862
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,384
Of commercial networking at Netgear

863
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,224
Last week

864
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,272
Well we all know it for home routers

865
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,832
You may not be as familiar with the commercial

866
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:32,928
Do you want to talk briefly about that as I said we target

867
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,208
Small businesses

868
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,768
Especially ones that are like do it yourself

869
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,072
Small office home office business

870
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,608
The it

871
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
She department

872
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,192
It's actually the business owner and we're the best networking

873
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,496
Company allowing those people to be sick

874
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Successful

875
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,080
The point frankly fairly Advanced Networks

876
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,616
What about security

877
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,896
Because me and

878
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
Routers like

879
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,944
Frontgate Interiors

880
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Tire iron

881
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,272
Yeah that's a really good point

882
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
And in fact

883
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
Did you look at

884
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,136
Some of the other Solutions are out there the customers

885
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,160
Required

886
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
Set up complicated

887
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
Cardinals

888
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
True there

889
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
Security

890
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,280
To make the cloud

891
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,816
Connectivity work at

892
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,840
It's a terrible

893
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,888
Formula that's going to end bad

894
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,704
And so that's why when we designed inside

895
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,752
We did it from the ground up to be

896
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,544
Self Deployable

897
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,568
Absolutely

898
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:26,944
Secure what we did was we drew on the same technology we've been using for our readiness

899
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,992
Ready Cloud Solutions the last

900
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:33,600
Six seven years it's the same architecture we use with Arlo cameras

901
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,624
So that means there's

902
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,392
Literally

903
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,440
4 million of these agents

904
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:43,328
Purely running day-in-and-day-out to buy choosing an architecture which was already

905
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,864
Simple little boy abs

906
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
Absolutely robot

907
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,168
And time test

908
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,960
We knew that we would get in

909
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,520
Experience for customers wouldn't be compromised

910
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
Which is on

911
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,384
And you guys have notifications or maybe some sort of

912
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,712
Machine learning that understands when bad things enter the network

913
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,272
Absolutely and that's one of the

914
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,320
Neat things about Cloud connected

915
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Devices

916
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,368
It's because what that does is

917
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,928
Is create a very close relationship

918
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,208

A monthly or yearly

And I'm ashamed to say since I was such an early and

986
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,280
Enthusiastic a doctor that you have and I still have not tried the

987
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
Terrible

988
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,632
Free trial

989
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,400
Let's

990
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
Kick it off with

991
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
Men

992
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,472
I really want to know we should

993
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
How

994
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
House

995
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Did you cut this

996
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:04,800
Greystone

997
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,080
So much

998
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:10,176
Kevin and I beforehand we're looking at this it looks like there's no scale in here

999
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
It looks like they're still the

1000
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
Computer vision aspect of it

1001
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,784
Looks like there may not be enough

1002
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,320
Break it down for me

1003
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,880
How did you go from 1495

1004
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,160
2 499

1005
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
Lots of little things

1006
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,744
Is the best way to describe it

1007
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,024
Particular examples

1008
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,816
So one of the really nice things

1009
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
For all of our customer

1010
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,376
Where is that

1011
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
90%

1012
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,728
We're able to learn usage pattern

1013
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,288
Figure out what the most important teachers are on the tree

1014
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
So for example

1015
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,104
Our automated

1016
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
Cook programs

1017
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,200
With Summer by the Cameron some U2 summer menu

1018
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,016
Those make up 42% of all cook session

1019
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,320
Single largest

1020
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
Whale

1021
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
Not to people cooking

1022
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,648
Is by using

1023
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
Are automatic

1024
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
And so

1025
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,232
When we can

1026
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,768
Dug into that a little more

1027
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,584
We thought about when you were the most important aspects of that and

1028
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,376
Two of those aspects are

1029
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,728
Able to do Oliver

1030
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
Automatically

1031
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,032
No preheat

1032
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,568
And so are coming

1033
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,872
That's one area where

1034
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,920
Easily could have saved a lot of cost and

1035
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
Decided not to

1036
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,968
Based off of

1037
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,272
And then

1038
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:23,136
Camera another easy ways to take money off of our bill of materials are bomb and again

1039
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
Very important

1040
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,184
Feature to shortcut.

1041
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,720
Access record program

1042
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,000
And so we have that.

1043
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
Those were not

1044
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
Good things

1045
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,120
Save money on and then we started looking for other place

1046
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,656
And so one of those places

1047
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,936
A weight scale

1048
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,216
Report load cells

1049
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,800
And we're able to look at the data

1050
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,824
And see how often

1051
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
People were actually wearing their food

1052
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:47,200
Some people that do it a lot

1053
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
The majority people

1054
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
Never ever use that feature

1055
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
And

1056
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,344
So why should we have our customers

1057
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
Have to pay it

1058
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,392
That Hardware

1059
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,440
The future that is not very used

1060
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,256
And so we were able to actually use data on usage pattern

1061
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,304
Figure out that that was an okay teacher

1062
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,096
You're too removed from the product

1063
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,376
Wait so I thought

1064
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,704
Oven automatically

1065
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
The cooking time

1066
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,032
Haven't use weight as one

1067
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,312
Variables

1068
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,360
It would be a more

1069
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:19,456
Valuable sensor that actually was that we would one day use it as

1070
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,480
Of value to

1071
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,504
Adjust cook Bergen

1072
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784
Fractions

1073
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576
I always thought you did

1074
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,624
Colour Me surprised

1075
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,928
I use it every time

1076
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,208
It's automatically doing it

1077
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,792
Temperature in the different temperature sensor

1078
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,656
Okay so

1079
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,680
You took out the scale

1080
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
What else did you

1081
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,752
That's one area to another area

1082
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
That

1083
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,824
Great opportunity save a lot of money

1084
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,128
Can I lower quality

1085
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
Display

1086
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,432
Touchscreen work

1087
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
Computer

1088
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Empress

1089
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,760
I got her homework and

1090
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,552
That was not the place to cut corners

1091
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,832
And so we still have a

1092
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,672
2.3 gigahertz quad-core computer on the June oven

1093
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,488
An area that we did see that people were using

1094
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,792
As the primary method

1095
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,840
Communicating with their June oven

1096
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
Versus using the knob

1097
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
And so even though we were

1098
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
The feature that

1099
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,752
Weatherford fire

1100
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,640
Gentoo does not have a knob on the front it's just a touch screen

1101
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
But you can also

1102
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,944
Control your voice using Alexa

1103
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,504
Okay so that feels super controversial to me

1104
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,808
Maybe because I'm old and I do use the

1105
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,088
I like having that

1106
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
Interface

1107
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,440
Because it makes me feel like the oven will still work even if the

1108
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,720
Touch screen goes kerplunk

1109
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,024
And is that just me kidding myself

1110
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,816
I mean if the computer goes coupon

1111
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,912
True okay

1112
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,008
Limited edition original

1113
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:51,360
So you can brag call your friends and one of the amazing things also about softer

1114
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,919
So you've been

1115
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,479
With a lot of features that

1116
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,759
I barely got any press

1117
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,807
I'm getting a lot of press on today as

1118
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,879
New June Gentoo features but in reality

1119
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
Same operating

1120
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,463
Platform so you've been

1121
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,279
Getting all these features over the last year-and-a-half

1122
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,815
Her free just as

1123
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
Software update

1124
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,399
Our new customers will get to experience all those as

1125
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,935
I love their intro to Judy

1126
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,983
Overwhelming

1127
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
It kind of feels like

1128
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,823
I don't know what to do with that

1129
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,103
No I love my

1130
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,919
Okay let's go back to cutting

1131
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
Cost

1132
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,223
Scale knob

1133
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,247
What other things

1134
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:34,623
The primary features from other areas there is a lot of simplification

1135
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
Designs

1136
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,207
So taking everything that we've learned from

1137
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
How to make a

1138
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,255
June oven in gen 1

1139
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,535
What type of

1140
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,071
Decisions can we make

1141
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,143
On the second generation

1142
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,167
There are

1143
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
3

1144
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,983
Variables and you only get two

1145
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263
Focus on two of them

1146
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,031
So

1147
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
All those variables

1148
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
Quality

1149
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,359
Quality of the product

1150
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,383
The Nexus calling

1151
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
What time so

1152
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,711
Crunch to ship

1153
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,247
We should go first June oven

1154
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
Literally on

1155
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,807
And then the

1156
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,623
Would be cost

1157
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,159
And so on

1158
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,207
1st June oven we optimized

1159
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743
Quality Inn

1160
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,511
Speed to Market

1161
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
And

1162
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
But this time

1163
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,583
Basic qualities

1164
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,119
List of most important thing

1165
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,447
But we Orient ourselves and knew the importance

1166
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,495
Getting a more accessible price point

1167
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,567
And so we made sure to build that in

1168
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,615
The shipment ready

1169
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,431
Excellent let's talk about the plans for

1170
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:35,295
June going forward I was always intrigued by you guys because

1171
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
You built this

1172
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,879
Product it was arguably smart it wasn't just connect

1173
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,415
It was actually smart

1174
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
I really appreciate it

1175
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,791
Since I see lots of terrible connected stuff but it was expensive I was I

1176
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,095
Constantly asking you about your business models

1177
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,655
And I paid for upgrades in the form of

1178
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,215
I bought an air fryer tray

1179
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
Gourmet package

1180
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,407
You know what felt like you guys had an interesting

1181
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
I don't know if it's

1182
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,711
Stainable or not model

1183
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,015
Also adding a new lower price

1184
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,063
What does that say about

1185
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,623
What the business models are anticipating going with

1186
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,415
For the next however long it takes

1187
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
Where does the

1188
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,815
From our perspective

1189
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
The most important thing

1190
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,911
To the last business I was involved in

1191
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
Focused on

1192
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
Getting lots of

1193
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,775
Musers that we didn't sell a product what was the social networking

1194
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,335
Social news site

1195
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,639
The general idea was get lots of eyeballs

1196
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,687
Figure out how to monetize it later

1197
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,735
Work together

1198
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,759
The Social Network

1199
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,063
That's what I think that we can like about that business model

1200
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,343
Because in that world

1201
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,879
You can only have two masters

1202
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,927
You deserve customers are you sure

1203
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,023
People keeping the lights on so and usually that you know what the advertiser

1204
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,583
And so for us we want to be able to surf

1205
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:55,679
We want to make a product that's high quality that's worth paying for

1206
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,775
That was the one requirement

1207
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
When we were

1208
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,383
Work together before we even that decided

1209
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,687
We wanted to make something that was

1210
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,503
HEB business

1211
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:13,343
But that is hard and I say this not to be a jerk but

1212
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,671
Because even things like Roku which sells Hardware also

1213
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:21,023
Most of their money on advertising and you look at the fate of like GoPro and Fitbit

1214
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,327
I'm thinking everyone points to Apple with nuts

1215
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,607
Great place to be

1216
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,471
It's really hard to be a

1217
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
So

1218
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,919
Should I expect you guys I mean are you sustainable just as selling this product

1219
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,479
For the rest of your life do you plan to Branch out into other

1220
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,551
Kitchen products I know a lot of companies are now looking at

1221
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:49,183
Trying to talk about a hard business. Sounds like a really hard business

1222
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
Every few weeks

1223
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,863
From our perspective would focus on

1224
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,399
We have

1225
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,679
Relied on that in the past

1226
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,239
Look for today when we're not relying on that

1227
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,543
That's a big part of taking a risk

1228
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,615
Company like June to be able to ring

1229
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,919
A product like the June intelligent oven to Market

1230
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,735
Bring a lot about your first shareholders

1231
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
Great product

1232
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,367
Let's flip to your subscription business

1233
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:22,719
Because you guys launched the recipes tell us a little bit about recipe

1234
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
Is how that's going

1235
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,303
Herzing to try

1236
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,607
Chicken eaters

1237
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,887
Nope you need to work on

1238
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,423
Cuz I want the feedback

1239
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,471
Walkthrough

1240
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,287
Can I was out there

1241
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,823
And the most part

1242
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,871
Recipes online are YouTube videos in

1243
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
X-Files

1244
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919
Sometimes

1245
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,223
Get some fun

1246
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:48,319
Tasty or something like that but we didn't see any experience out there that

1247
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,343
Was actually

1248
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,111
Guided

1249
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
Dress we have

1250
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,439
This opportunity

1251
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
Do guided cooking

1252
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,511
While also having

1253
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,791
All the right hooks

1254
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,327
Into this

1255
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,143
Enso

1256
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
When your

1257
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,447
Cooking in the

1258
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,263
Recharge 499 a month

1259
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,847
And you're doing a program where

1260
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,895
Teaching you how to perfectly dressed up

1261
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,711
Your iPhone or iPad

1262
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,247
We ask you how you like your salmon

1263
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,527
And I wish you remember

1264
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,807
This recipe before

1265
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,343
Otherwise it's not medium rare

1266
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,111
And then

1267
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,903
By the time you're at the last Avenue

1268
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Distressing

1269
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,743
Getting it ready to go in the oven the ovens already

1270
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,767
Expecting salmon

1271
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,815
And already know she wanted medium rare

1272
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,607
So you didn't have to do anything other than

1273
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,631
Put it in there

1274
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,399
Walkaway

1275
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,935
For us it's about how do we

1276
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:40,799
Great great experiences that are inspired people to cook more and more

1277
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,359
Are you looking to broaden that I mean

1278
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:49,247
What are the challenges with cooking is people have their own recipes they want to find stuff everywhere

1279
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,783
I feel like it'd be impossible to

1280
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,343
Create these awesome recipe experiences

1281
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,927
I searched bon appetit

1282
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
Cooking Light

1283
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719

Publix 30 cookbook

1285
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
So

1286
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,327
I look at something and paying $5 a month for

1287
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,655
Something that I can't bring all that a digital content into its

1288
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,983
So are you looking to be in Bordeaux

1289
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,519
Platform play therapy

1290
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
Possibly

Suppress we're only in RNA

1292
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
The current plan

1293
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,919
Crossword making new content on a

1294
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687
Weekly basis

1295
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,503
Thai recipes cookbook

1296
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,367
Really nice

1297
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,951
We're cooking our pictures of habit

1298
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,743
Most people cook the same things every week

1299
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,791
And I know for my own behavior

1300
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,839
I actually wish I was trying

1301
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,863
You think more often

1302
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,447
Discover something and then it just enters the routine

1303
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,215
And so

1304
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,751
Are you with the cookbook

1305
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,031
Two recipes that

1306
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:48,639
Weather in my regular routine now from the gym cookbook one is that are fried chicken and

1307
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,223
Know the recipe mostly

1308
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:52,991
Stewart

1309
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:58,111
Watch the looping videos on the iPad of every single staff because I

1310
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,951
Sorry I tried to cheat on the June cookbook

1311
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:06,303
Fried Chicken 14 times I really don't need to watch blippi videos again

1312
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,839
I forgot one of the most important

1313
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:08,863
I literally

1314
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,631
Room dinner

1315
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
By skipping

1316
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,191
And so even though

1317
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,007
Following the steps

1318
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,055
Keeping me honest and making sure that

1319
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,591
Forget anything is really powerful

1320
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,383
Air fried chicken

1321
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,687
One of those dots to my regular routine

1322
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,479
The other is this amazing

1323
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Salmon dish

1324
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,927
Something that I I need to watch the steps everyday

1325
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:39,071
Talk to me about some of this data that you've got I know that you guys for example you told the story to me

1326
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,399
Cooking bacon in there

1327
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:45,215
You realize that the most important variable in

1328
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,007
Cooking bacon is how many slices

1329
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,031
People use

1330
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,847
So I'm curious what kind of data are you seeing both friend

1331
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,919
Recipes

1332
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,527
People were having bad

1333
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:04,927
So we ended up taking all that data and those conversations and returned one bacon program in 264 bacon

1334
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,815
Another really cool thing that

1335
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,631
We're able to do is so now we have over

1336
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,679
Automatically program

1337
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
I'm all of them

1338
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,495
No preheat and

1339
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,519
We would get

1340
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,823
In the app people can talk about their cooking

1341
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,663
Cooking spray

1342
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,455
Customer experience team

1343
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,991
Things like restate program

1344
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,015
Which in the beginning

1345
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,039
Required

1346
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,063
In the early days

1347
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,855
And it was a three-step program

1348
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,159
We would prompt you to look at at some point

1349
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:45,887
And so we took it upon ourselves and our culinary team to how do we create a cook program

1350
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:46,911
That

1351
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
What's good or bad

1352
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,727
Better

1353
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,775
To do it

1354
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,615
And we signed up for that challenge in our state program is now an eight

1355
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,663
Step by step

1356
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,687
Include the rest

1357
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,479
In the middle of it and

1358
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,247
People love it

1359
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,063
It's great another thing that

1360
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,343
Data wise was

1361
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,623
We're able to look at

1362
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
All the

1363
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,999
Food that have been cooked in all the June ovens in the world and figure out what

1364
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,279
And Lily stack rank

1365
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,815
The top foods that we didn't have

1366
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,095
Automated cook programs

1367
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,375
Works we can create them

1368
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,935
So actually I think about it

1369
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,215
Reheating of tortillas

1370
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
Was a top

1371
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,543
3 use case that we had no cook program

1372
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
Now we do

1373
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,407
Cannot wait to try it I've been away from my June for far too long

1374
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,687
What are some of the others

1375
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,783
Pizza was always very popular in the gym and we have

1376
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,855
A pizza program but we did not have a yesterday speech

1377
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,623
Pizza

1378
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
Program

1379
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,927
Which is totally what you need

1380
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
Some people do

1381
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,279
Cookies in the oven

1382
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,327
The pizzeria

1383
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,911
On the oven

1384
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:55,519
And we were seeing literally receipt just slices of pizza just sitting on racks

1385
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,407
That we have yesterday's Pizza

1386
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,455
Does it go in the rack

1387
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,479
I always put my

1388
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
Michael Mina recommend

1389
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:10,623
Putting on a pizza stone under broil that's his official recommendation

1390
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:15,231
I was like I was like a piece of stone that's pretty specialized stuff right there

1391
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,535
It's already a lot

1392
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,559
Ashley Reed

1393
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,607
I just shove it in my mouth

1394
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,143
Sometimes I am

1395
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,983
Okay let's quickly talk about some of the

1396
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,031
Gachas are things that have happened with

1397
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,103
The oven so far so I was surprised to see that it's running

1398
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,871
Android

1399
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,639
This was back

1400
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:36,223
Can a day are you guys still using Android or Android Things Are

1401
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:36,991
Did you use

1402
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
Something else for the

1403
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
We

1404
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,367
Have

1405
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,135
And

1406
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,415
On top of that there certain

1407
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,207
Frameworks from Android

1408
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,767
Design perspective

1409
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,559
User experience perspective

1410
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:54,399
There's no hint of Android with in any of the amazingly bill

1411
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:58,495
We stretch the limits of what you can do with embedded Linux and certain Frameworks from Android

1412
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,799
Create

1413
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,079
What we call junoesque

1414
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,871
So I don't need to worry about me

1415
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,895
My Juno s not be

1416
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:05,919
Supported in

1417
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,247
Battlescribe

1418
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,039
Okay can you share with us

1419
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,063
A sense of

1420
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,087
How much it cost

1421
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,135
To support a June oven

1422
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,951
Annually or how much you guys are thinking about from

1423
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:23,839
Cloud security cost I know you guys spend a lot of time and effort programs an update

1424
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,863
Appreciate

1425
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,679
I don't have a specific dollar answer for you but

1426
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,447
From

1427
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,471
Perspective

1428
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,775
Design goals when we were

1429
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,847
Designing June is we didn't want it to not

1430
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,871
Work

1431
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,151
Your Wi-Fi goes down

1432
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,455
That would be the worst experience ever that you can cook

1433
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,759
Cook dinner because your wife I went down

1434
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
And so

1435
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,319
We spend a lot of time engineering

1436
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,623
An experience that doesn't actually require golang

1437
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
The cloud

1438
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,207
For example

1439
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,255
Detection

1440
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,791
And yes we download

1441
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,071
Updates from the server

1442
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,119
That makes me a better butt

1443
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:01,215
When all the food recognition all that happens locally all ETA or

1444
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,543
Take the Baton.

1445
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,591
And so is the most intense

1446
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,127
Processing

1447
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,223
To save money on card

1448
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,247
George Bush

1449
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,527
Music store

1450
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,623
So could I bring a June oven into my house

1451
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,391
Sand

1452
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,951
Connected to my wifi once and then

1453
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,511
You know check the app and just use it normally

1454
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:28,095
Do that without even connecting to wifi

1455
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,911
We have customers that have email.

1456
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,191
Taking it camping

1457
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,055
Running recent software

1458
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:42,175
Any software updates because we're always constantly

1459
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,247
I have many questions about getting the June oven to work

1460
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:48,063
Since I am in fact

1461
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,879
I haven't done at 5.

1462
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,415
But I know someone who has

1463
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,719
I really enjoy that they

1464
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,487
Brought it with him

1465
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,535
Yeah is there a s'more setting

1466
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,327
Let's get real here

1467
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,863
So there is not a

1468
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,143
Smart setting

1469
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
Something you could do

1470
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,239
You can

1471
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,031
Put the oven on broil

1472
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,335
You can actually

1473
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:13,151
Dissmore's an accident few weeks ago and it was

1474
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,431
Pretty amazing election

1475
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,455
Better than a campfire

1476
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
Okay every

1477
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,039
