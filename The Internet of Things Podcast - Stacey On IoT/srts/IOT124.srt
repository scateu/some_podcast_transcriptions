00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host

2
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,128
Kevin tofel

3
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:19,968
Going to talk about

4
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,272
Automated Factory

5
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,064
Energy harvesting Tech

6
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,112
Details on homekit

7
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,904
Some Google home preview stuff

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,928
And

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,768
A review of a new device I purchased

10
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
Is it a small

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,584
It is not the small

12
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,120
But it's never

13
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,216
But first

14
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,776
Before we do anything we must cover this

15
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,800
Most important

16
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,080
Moment of the show

17
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,104
Which is

18
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,408
Last week we talked about wink

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,968
Being purchased by William

20
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,528
And I said William after

21
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,064
How much struggle was a member of Alec

22
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,344
Fast and I was wrong

23
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,440
Wish everyone was very quick to point out which I am

24
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,488
I love that your dedication to William

25
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,024
So strong

26
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,840
I have a good thing that wasn't the Daily Double on Today Show

27
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,680
Exactly so William is actually he was a member of The Black Eyed Pea

28
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,728
Which is why Fergie kept

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
I feel better about that

30
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,360
But moving along to this week's

31
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,128
Coverage

32
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,176
We have no updates on William a twink

33
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,200
Unfortunately

34
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,736
I am waiting

35
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,504
For that

36
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
Hey

37
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,880
This week sponsor who is Hico Solutions

38
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
And a preview of our guests Michael Spears who is the head of infrastructure cyber

39
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Security at

40
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Honeywell

41
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,912
And he is going to be really fascinating you guys were talking about

42
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,704
How to secure

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,312
Physical plants they have totally different threat Landscapes but some of the things they do

44
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,848
The rest of the world probably

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,872
I'm as well

46
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,640
So

47
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
Stay tuned for that

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
And now

49
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,968
Message from another

50
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
This week sponsor is Eero and let me tell you guys Eros

51
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
These are wireless mesh routers there are brand new 2nd generation Eero routers out there

52
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
Or and I can tell you that I have them currently installed in my house and they are fast

53
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,776
Eero router said I had installed at my house for the last year-and-a-half

54
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:26,176
These contain what major Eero a square that looks like kind of the other Eros and then it has

55
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,576
Beacons bees are mesh access points are not Wi-Fi extenders but these mesh access

56
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:38,976
Test points are smaller you can plug them in and they also act as a night light and the cool thing is

57
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:45,376
These are backwards compatible with your old Eero so you can upgrade your Eros

58
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,776
By buying a couple new beacons if you want $449 or if you don't have

59
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:58,176
Mesh wi-fi system yet you can buy the Eero in its original 3-pack configuration of one major

60
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
Beacon Sports

61
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,296
Free 99

62
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:09,696
If you want to buy these zero routers you should go to the Eero ero.com

63
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
And when you buy it you should put the code Stacey Stacey

64
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:22,496
And you'll get free shipping you also tell Eero that you listen podcast will keep getting advertisers

65
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:27,104
Yay okay so now onto the show

66
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
Talk about Adidas

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Shadow

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
We shall

69
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
We shall

70
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,600
This I thought was a wicked cool story and I can't believe no one else has

71
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,648
Tell me about this sew in

72
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,232
Little Rock Arkansas there is a Chinese company

73
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
Tiana Von Karman

74
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,048
Company of Suzhou

75
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Yes

76
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,144
So they signed an agreement with software automation of

77
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
Atlanta

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,240
Hey to a partnership with the Georgia Tech advanced technology

79
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Development Center

80
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
And all of this means that

81
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,408
Jian-yang is going to be producing shirts for Adidas

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
In a fully automated Factory

83
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
Invite fully automated

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,552
Basically this thing uses cameras to me

85
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,136
Fabric is using robots to steer the fabric to the sewing needles

86
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
And

87
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,208
They're going to make t-shirts for Adidas

88
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
A whole lot of t-shirts

89
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
Adidas

90
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,327
Because the numbers are mind-blowing to Miyagi

91
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
I'm not familiar with Industrial

92
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
Production of such things but when I saw

93
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,495
How many T-shirts they can produce I was blown away

94
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
Me too I don't know how they're going to sell out

95
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,175
So they will produce 800,000 t-shirts a day for Adidas in this Factory

96
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
On 21 production lines

97
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
And the crazy part

98
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:43,391
Is it the Personnel cost for each t-shirt is roughly $0.33

99
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,951
That is like the cheapest labor

100
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
One can

101
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Find

102
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
Which is good in bed

103
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
Yes

104
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,911
I think right because on the green side it's certainly good for Adidas because it

105
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
Certainly lower their costs

106
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,055
I wish I could pass on the consumers or they can just take him or process etcetera

107
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,871
But if you're a worker in this industry

108
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
It's probably a bad thing

109
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,271
Yeah so this is going to bring 400 new jobs to Arkansas

110
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
But

111
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,855
If you imagined 400 jobs

112
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
Producing

113
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
800

114
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,719
Thousand t-shirts a day

115
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
One every 22 seconds

116
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,375
That is a huge productivity bump that is not being handled

117
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
So then the question is

118
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
What do people do

119
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
And

120
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
That is a

121
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,823
Big question that were trying to figure out

122
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,383
Across all Industries I personally think

123
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,175
It frees people up to do

124
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
Are creative and fun things

125
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Kwik podcast

126
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
Slate podcast

127
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,135
But it also thinks you can think about designing and

128
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,463
Where new cosmic coming from and

129
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
I guess

130
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
The lower

131
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,815
I don't know what that lower cost of t-shirt

132
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,143
Yeah I mean there's other stuff with positive us

133
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,703
Pics of it and this is really I think

134
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
Tip of the iceberg Salt Lake is the first

135
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,543
Production line that is fully automated

136
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
Obviously

137
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
But

138
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
It's a very tangible

139
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
Example of what's going on

140
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
In manufacturing

141
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,527
Around the world and it's inevitable unfortunately

142
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
What is disturbing

143
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,903
Is it feels like this manufacturer the automated Manufacturing

144
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,695
A lot of Chinese companies are in

145
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Investing in this

146
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
I would like to in

147
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
With much manufacturing is

148
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Already happening

149
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
Can China fit Foxconn

150
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,423
Is investing in fully automated

151
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
I believe iPhone play

152
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,567
So Foxconn already has 40000 robots on it

153
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,407
Production lines Foxconn is Apple's main iPhone assembler

154
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,783
And basically it is replaced more than half of its Workforce with robots

155
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Since

156
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
The launch of the iPhone 6

157
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
That is

158
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
A lot

159
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
And they have men

160
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Lights out

161
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
Which are fully automated production lines at some of the

162
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Their factories

163
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
And the whole idea is

164
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,887
Tire factories not just production line

165
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Mine's operate

166
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,751
This is a crazy this actually it's not crazy

167
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,055
This is a big deal because

168
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,615
If the future of automation

169
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
And Manufacturing

170
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
Is

171
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Robots

172
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
China is really

173
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
Pushing hard on

174
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
Leaving ahead here

175
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,415
And that means we can have manufacturing anywhere

176
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
Because we've got

177
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231
It'll be automated

178
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
And we'll be looking for things you know

179
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:35,423
Setting up these industrial cluster so you don't have to ship things as far it's a really interesting kind of

180
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,471
Manufacturing and Industry

181
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
You shouldn't kind of vision

182
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
But

183
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,335
I am concerned that we are

184
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
In the US are not at the

185
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
And yeah

186
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,783
It's funny that you mention Foxconn and Apple only because

187
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,695
When you crack your iPhone screen and take it in to get repaired at an Apple store or some third part

188
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Party such as Best Buy

189
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
It's not a person who repairs it anymore

190
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,071
It is it is not

191
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
And that is why

192
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,679
When you go there and I've had a couple of the kids have crackers screens

193
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
It's almost always

194
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Should be done in an hour

195
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,103
I know it's an hour because not because there's a person sitting there saying it's going to take me an hour to do this

196
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Apple has

197
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,175
Created automated machines that do it

198
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
For them

199
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Is a comet

200
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Redis

201
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Yikes alright

202
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Yikes

203
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,047
Because there's not a lot we can adhere

204
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
It's it's something that I'm constantly thinking about

205
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
In reading about

206
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
I have no great conclusions like

207
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
So let's talk about energy Harvest

208
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
Cuz

209
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,383
This was really cool I am a big fan

210
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Of

211
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Energy harvesting

212
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
And I've been

213
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,319
Caring about this for so long because I have so many devices that

214
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
Batteries in my home

215
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,695
But I'm also thinking about things like hey if we put a bunch of sensors on Bridges

216
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,535
Or sensors under parking spaces are those kind of things

217
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,631
How do we change the batteries in this it's

218
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
It's not possible today so

219
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
That's why

220
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,055
Anything that harvests its own energy is really cool

221
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,407
We have to look at this I think because Battery Technology really has not

222
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,711
Drastically changed over

223
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,015
Pastor K Square Dallas ISO

224
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,159
And we have more mobile devices they all have batteries of course so how do we recharge them how do we

225
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,719
Get energy back into them quicker without

226
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
Using the traditional plug it in method

227
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,815
So this is very big

228
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:43,423
So this article in a link to in the story is from CNN

229
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
Engineering

230
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
News not CNN

231
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
Betsy and

232
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Eaton

233
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
Worth noticing

234
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
In the cupboard

235
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,967
Some things I knew so the main forms of energy harvesting

236
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
AR

237
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Solar

238
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,343
Solar power things there's pie co which takes

239
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
Like motion energy

240
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,927
And converts it into

241
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
There's also

242
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,791
Temperature differentials can be used as well

243
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
In certain sensors

244
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,143
This article talked about something I hadn't dealt

245
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Before

246
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:20,799
It's a rare earth magnet the moves on Springs alongside a wire coil and generates electricity

247
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,895
It produces between 50 and 90 million watts of power that's milliwatts you

248
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
Guys not a lot right much

249
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,527
But that's enough to energy like to power temperature sensor

250
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,623
A mems device like a mems accelerometer and a wireless transmitter

251
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,207
So this is from a company called perpetuum

252
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
I do like its name

253
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:46,655
This could work under they filter rail system so it goes under a passenger or Freight cars in rails and

254
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,495
Grabs information send it to a Gateway and then it goes to the

255
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
To the cloud

256
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,103
Real workers can act on any of the data

257
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
Like

258
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,991
It's a little extra bumpy here I could see something like this working for detecting potholes

259
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,295
In a city using like a Laura

260
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Radio

261
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Maybe

262
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Which

263
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
We talked about it the show

264
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
4

265
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
So

266
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:14,559
I thought the magnets kind of thing was cool but basically I just wanted to draw y'all's attention to this because

267
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
I don't think we talked about it enough

268
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,703
I don't think there's a lot of research happening here that

269
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Sleek

270
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,591
I mean I talk to an ocean which is the big name in this field and they've been around for

271
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
17 years

272
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
They do great things but

273
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
I'm kind of like

274
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
What else is there

275
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,807
Yeah I mean this is a field that I think is right for

276
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Further

277
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,135
Rationed probably further investment

278
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
We need to rethink how we

279
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
How are things

280
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,071
Because the things themselves have gotten so small and don't use as much energy

281
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,887
Required for a hardwired power saw

282
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:54,239
Source or a battery you know what I mean the batteries are larger than the sensors at this point

283
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
And we should also note

284
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,895
When I talk to people in like the industrial World about

285
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
Sensing and battery-powered

286
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,039
Sensors they talk about it being a psychological choice

287
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
I was like what are you talking about

288
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Psychology element

289
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
And basically what they're talking about

290
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
Is this idea

291
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,023
A mighty world we want to know everything that's happening

292
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
All the time

293
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Breakdown

294
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
And in some of the industrial world

295
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
They're like hey

296
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,447
How often really do I need the

297
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
This

298
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,543
And it's a very simple fact that if you have your

299
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,079
Item only update

300
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
Three times a day

301
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,199
Uses less power than going to waking up every 20 seconds to send it

302
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,807
These guys actually think about that as part of their design

303
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
Their overall systems

304
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,183
They're from a worldview which is very

305
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,255
Power constrained in very sensitive just this sort of

306
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
Think so I thought that was kind of an interesting way

307
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Think about

308
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,863
How often do I need my

309
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
Water sensor if it's

310
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Not

311
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
Reporting a leak

312
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
To wake up

313
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,823
You know maybe once a day just to tell me the temperature is fine

314
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,663
And then when something goes wrong it could be like

315
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:12,575
So that's really all I have to say about this I recommend you check out the article and you know if you guys have some great ideas or

316
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
Cool energy harvesting

317
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,415
God send it to me I am like

318
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Really

319
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
Really want to nerd out Deep

320
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Cell

321
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
Moving right along to slightly less

322
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
Pistol dirty but in a good way

323
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,751
It's more accessible because it's Apple by golly

324
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
So I have been the biggest doubter

325
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,871
I really had next to me next

326
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
To see whose outcome Campmor

327
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,759
We might have less doubts now

328
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
Fewer doubts

329
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,831
I'm in a few workouts you can have left

330
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,135
And thicker Marian's listening to the shokan

331
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
So

332
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Apple

333
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
Said cryptically

334
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,399
It was going to make homekit available to a wider

335
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Number of

336
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Partners

337
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,079
And I had Adam Justice on the show then and he pointed that out to me

338
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
And he's like I don't know

339
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,663
And then we saw the release of

340
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
Products like

341
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,503
Ikea's tradfri

342
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,087
Lamps and actually announced that it would work with Apple

343
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
In the future

344
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
His travel

345
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,047
Apple has required you to have a certification ship

346
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
It's all part of it security

347
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
And so that's why you got all these like

348
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,447
You got to buy a new hub

349
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
Which kind of sucked if you were a consumer

350
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
Which is why I did not like it

351
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
But now

352
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,663
Box it looks

353
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,479
Black people are actually implementing

354
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
The

355
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
Mfi certification chip

356
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,855
Less version of home gym

357
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
And that's exciting

358
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
And then there's one other piece of this that

359
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,975
Seems kind of exciting that

360
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
The Verge

361
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,815
They had a column from the internet of

362
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,375
I can't say it on this show and keep my

363
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Berating soda

364
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
The internet

365
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
But he was a write-up

366
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
The point or she

367
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
With no nose

368
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Sonos

369
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Homekit

370
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,271
With the homepod in December

371
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,647
To make it accessible to Android and Apple homes the mixed homes as it

372
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:32,351
And I think that would be a smart move if that's the case said it was already seen one major

373
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,887
Apple service

374
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
Compatible with Android and that was

375
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Apple music

376
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:44,383
That's actually one of the reasons I think that Apple music subscriptions are going up because there's a wider group of potential

377
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
Customer ser

378
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
And partly that's because

379
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,783
That what music is really came from Beats Music which was already

380
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,343
Android-compatible so that just made sense to continue it

381
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
But yeah I mean if you could get the

382
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Homepod

383
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,207
Working with Android

384
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,535
Again you broaden your potential audience at smart

385
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,351
Well and I look at this from a business perspective

386
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:11,263
Apple has historically made everything work with their phone their phone was the flagship of the business of that lie

387
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
Talk about computers later

388
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
But

389
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
Mobile

390
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,895
Hadoop operating system

391
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
The phone was it and that was the key

392
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
Computer for everything

393
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
With his signals

394
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
Possibly

395
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
Is a realization

396
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
That

397
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
You can still own the consumer

398
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
Without owning the home

399
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
And still provide

400
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,279
A viable ecosystem

401
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:39,679
And I don't know how apples going to make money off of this with homekit I don't know if you have to pay

402
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
I mean you have to pay

403
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:45,823
An mfi fee for the certification chips you have to be of mfi certified

404
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Developer

405
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
Etcetera

406
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
But

407
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,503
I like this because Apple

408
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,551
Has come a long way with the design

409
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
There's still some things I don't

410
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
But

411
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,463
It is user-friendly and

412
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,023
This is where things get a little weird and

413
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Developers are

414
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,375
Like apple what you doing and apples like

415
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,447
So you can actually set up a device

416
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,311
Using homekit and use it only in the whole map you don't have to actually set up the

417
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
App for the

418
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
Device

419
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:25,503
Right you can say you're reducing the number of apps required to manage your devices number one

420
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
That's a simpler

421
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,367
Sign up in end pairing type of process

422
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,439
Ben Franklin my ecobee it just showed up

423
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,487
Installment that's it I mean

424
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
It was there

425
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,655
The developers on the other hand are doing everything they can

426
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
2

427
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,799
Play as much as I can with apple but also get you to download the app so they have your

428
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
Formation your email

429
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,639
So someone like a lot

430
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,991
Might make you calibrate the lock in their own app

431
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,039
Where is after that point

432
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
You can move to

433
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
You know

434
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
The Apple

435
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
Experience

436
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,511
So this is producing a lot of tension so we'll see what happens

437
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,119
As part of this I'll just tell you that there's a brand-new homekit enabled

438
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,423
Light bulb from Sylvania

439
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Name brand

440
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,055
A colorful light bulb it is $45 no hub

441
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,615
So if you're like looking at the Hue Lights and you're like

442
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,151
Oh that should be home

443
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Love it

444
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
This is a Sylvania

445
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,527
Sylvania

446
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,951
And it works

447
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,487
Use

448
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
Bluetooth

449
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Yeah

450
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,863
Bluetooth

451
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
Homekit

452
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Friendly friendly

453
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
You wouldn't want this

454
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
If you're an apple house

455
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,943
And eventually after we test the homepod maybe we'll tell you what it's like to live in a mixed house and have these

456
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
Vices

457
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
This is good and

458
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,575
I imagine that eventually this will use Bluetooth

459
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
If it does

460
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,927
It's a double for pre-order for

461
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:13,023
For $45 so it's not an expensive but it's not too bad either

462
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Well actually the beer

463
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,191
39 teens in the BR30 that's it

464
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,495
I feel like the 19th

465
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,567
You land this year have a hub

466
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,919
So I'll get a test version of that

467
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
And I'll tell you how the

468
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
The lights work

469
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
And you can

470
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
Look forward to that they will not ship until

471
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Just so you know

472
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Okay

473
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,695
Movie from the homekit news let's go to the Google

474
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:50,655
This is interesting and I will say right up front that I have not signed up for this yet but there is a preview

475
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
Program if you had a Google home

476
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,031
You may sign up for the preview program and will happen is

477
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,615
Kind of like what they do with the Chromecast where they sent you

478
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,199
Advanced features sooner 4 beta testing essentially

479
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,527
MC make it new firmware on your Google home before everybody else

480
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,319
New features and so on

481
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,855
I generally

482
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,975
Can't pass up a beta program so once I put my Google home back in my home office which is

483
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,767
Undergoing renovation right now

484
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,119
I will sign up for this so I don't know what they might bring to us

485
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,215
We want to see but you can sign up maybe we can click the link in the show notes

486
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
We will

487
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
I will also sign up

488
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,335
Even though my Google home does not get the usage

489
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,943
Voice control Amazon Echo

490
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Control TVs

491
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
Certain TVs

492
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
Yeah and

493
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,647
For me my TV is not supported

494
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Officially but

495
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:51,839
If you have an Amazon Fire TV box which I do connected to my TV you can then pair your Echo with the Fire TV box

496
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
Cowboys control the TV that way

497
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,727
And in a speculative new story

498
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,079
Amazon echos make it multi-room audio

499
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
I thought you would like that

500
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
I'm just going to get

501
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Ricky forum

502
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,479
Where the heck is my Sonos

503
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,551
Where the hell is my Sonos I have

504
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,879
I've been buying Echoes and I don't want to buy the full Echoes because

505
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,976
I have all these lovely Sonos isn't in my room and talk card

506
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Frustrated

507
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:26,656
Well if multi-room audio comes to Echo devices I don't know that

508
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,472
There's a ton of incentive for Amazon to

509
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,520
Bring it to something

510
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,128
That's I'm not saying that's what they do

511
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
I'm just saying

512
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:41,760
I wouldn't be surprised if you never see that person

513
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,088
I don't think they promised they said they were going to do it

514
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
They did say that

515
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Did not text

516
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
I promise you

517
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
Right

518
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,072
I actually reached out to Sonos about two weeks ago maybe three weeks

519
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
And ask for an update

520
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
And then I will get that to you and then no one

521
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
That to me

522
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,264
I'm going to have to reach out again I guess

523
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,592
Moving on

524
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,152
Because it feels negative to complain all the time

525
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
On the show

526
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,968
Let's talk about

527
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,528
Cool story before we get our little review

528
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,064
Future of Home Building

529
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,136
I thought this was really interesting this is from Cee Pro

530
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
And

531
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
Basically

532
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,000
Ideas and Linares home Linares home builder

533
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
They have stopped

534
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:31,424
Putting low-voltage wiring this is the wiring for your speakers for doorbells for all kinds of things

535
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,752
They built the first Wi-Fi certified smart

536
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:39,104
Holmes and this is something the Wi-Fi alliance-certified earlier this summer

537
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,968
Yeah we remember we talked about and I was kind of scratching my head over

538
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,576
What Linares doing is they're going to pull CAT5 or 6 cable

539
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,416
2 WiFi access points as well as the doorbell look

540
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
Location

541
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,792
But they're not going to pull it to home office locations or entertainment center

542
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,608
So no speaker wire

543
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:04,448
Coax is only going to go to two TV locations in the majority of their new

544
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,264
This is a big freaking deal

545
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
Yes

546
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:14,688
This is a big freaking deal because it means another step closer towards Wireless whether you want it or not

547
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,528
And I don't want it I'm going to say I built my home in 2012

548
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:25,184
And I put Cat6 not CAT5 because it's Cat6 gigabit proof and I'm still hoping to get gigabit internet but it's not happening

549
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,256
Side note little bitterness

550
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,352
I tell people when they ask about future-proofing their home

551
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
To stick

552
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Cable

553
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,936
Running into an Ethernet Jack

554
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,728
Every room

555
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,544
I would agree and I know people hate hugs

556
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,616
By god it feels

557
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
And maybe

558
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,176
You know I'm thinking about

559
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,992
My original Eros actually I had them

560
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
I wired them

561
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
I meant so they weren't actually at 10

562
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,112
Because they were wired in

563
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Wi-Fi assist

564
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,024
With the beacons

565
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
There is

566
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
There is no

567
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,656
That is fully Wireless so maybe I'm right behind the

568
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
X

569
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Well

570
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,264
I mean the benefits of wired

571
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,896
Is it's pretty much guaranteed consistency right whereas wireless networks will fluctuate

572
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,456
Based on signal strength

573
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,248
And other things so

574
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,040
I agree with your concerns

575
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
On the flip side

576
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,160
I literally just bought a small 4K set

577
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:28,928
TV set

578
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,976
And I put it in our bedroom is wall-mounted

579
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,304
Enemies in Wi-Fi to watch 4K TV on it

580
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
Just like I do in the 4K set

581
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,400
In my office and we have a

582
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,680
1080p sets

583
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,728
Downstairs that was actually hardwired

584
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
But everything else is

585
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,312
Wireless mouse, don't have the Jacks in a cat stick

586
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,616
With the right

587
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,432
Wireless network you know it can work

588
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
Minutes working for me

589
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,296
What I could say to me multiple 4K streams and so on

590
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,088
So I guess even though I'm concerned

591
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:01,184
Hypocritical here because it is working for me all Wireless

592
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
That's a question

593
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
Are we

594
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Ready for this

595
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
In

596
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,816
Maybe we are I think about

597
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,632
You know Eero which is managing your connectivity

598
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,192
Are managing your signal strength in

599
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
Doing all of that

600
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,776
Prioritizing

601
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,080
Amazing

602
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:23,456
I'm in their services like plume that do similar things but only in the cloud

603
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:27,808
And Comcast is better than Samsung

604
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
Plume

605
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,112
So it's possible

606
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,928
It is which of the point now where Wireless

607
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,232
Speeds from routers and such

608
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
Are far faster than the

609
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,376
Piper the Broadband the wire Broadband of people get to the houses being with so

610
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,424
Maybe maybe this time

611
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:48,032
Maybe it's certainly lowers the cost of building a house and if your home builder you know

612
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,080
Ages copper

613
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,128
It's copper wiring so if you can

614
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
Stop

615
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,200
Wiring things to speakers that's that's

616
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
Very economical

617
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
I don't know y'all

618
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
Sacher listener test

619
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,880
Some thoughts I'd be curious to hear that

620
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
Cynosure

621
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,208
I should say

622
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,768
Because I got a question I actually got two questions about the

623
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,816
That's so quick note I always tell people

624
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,352
How much I like netatmo stuff

625
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,960
And then I got an email from an frustrated user because netatmo went down this weekend

626
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:22,592
Did a terrible job communicating to their customers about what happened

627
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
So

628
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,688
I heard back from that app they said the issues

629
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
Has been solved

630
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,808
Both issues have been thought they had two issues one as people cannot install their net out

631
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
Cameras

632
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,368
So please try again if

633
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
If you can install it

634
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:40,768
In two notifications were delayed in the camera missed events and that issue has also been solved

635
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,816
They didn't explain what happened

636
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,656
Hopefully if you had a netatmo camera that wasn't work

637
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,424
Working this weekend

638
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
Try everything again

639
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,728
Restart it

640
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,008
And see what happens

641
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
It still doesn't work let me know and I will

642
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,824
Come back to them and be

643
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,360
All right guys

644
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,944
That's up to you there

645
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
And then finally

646
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
A tiny little review

647
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,344
A tiny little review of a tiny little device that I was so excited to have

648
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,648
Okay you guys probably remember

649
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,208
That I wanted a standalone Spotify

650
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
Player to take on walks with

651
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
My dog

652
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,560
And I bought the mighty

653
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,888
It's the mighty player in this is the be mighty

654
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
Dotcom is so

655
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,680
Website

656
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,728
This is a $95

657
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
It looks like an iPod Shuffle

658
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,568
Yes the tiny little ones you can't control

659
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,872
It works

660
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
So well

661
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
So

662
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,736
They promised me five hours of battery life

663
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:39,136
Pushed it to four and a half and then I was like if I don't charge now I won't have access to my music tomorrow morning

664
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,440
Fullback is a

665
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,256
It's a fit like it's a

666
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:48,096
Probably 1 and 1/2 inch by 1 and 1/2 inch I'm not looking directly at the specs

667
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
Device

668
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:54,240
But the whole back is the clip so it's not like there's a smaller clip so it's a little awkward

669
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
Sometimes to put on my

670
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
My outfit

671
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
Going out to walk the dog

672
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,152
Works with both

673
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:04,480
Bluetooth headphones and wired headphones so gay

674
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,760
And

675
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,808
Actually has made me want to get wired

676
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
Are wireless headphones now

677
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
It

678
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:16,256
It's user interface is really simple it does take kind of a long time to

679
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,072
Move up play move your playlist over

680
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,912
Alright alright playlist over via WiFi

681
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,496
Your home Wi-Fi and that's I'm assuming we're it's also doing the DRM

682
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Play Spotify

683
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,360
Checking in but it also will do things like

684
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
There's an option to

685
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,992
Succumbing option I didn't see it yet on my thing

686
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,760
2

687
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,600
But keep it fresh which means some of their playlist that you might have Daya

688
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
Update

689
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,392
Pretty lady

690
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,464
And that'll automatically update it when it's on your Wi-Fi network

691
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
In the house

692
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,304
I looked at it works exactly like I thought it was going to work

693
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632
3 weeks and

694
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
By God

695
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,264
I suspect that you have to sink that

696
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
To Spotify

697
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,872
Once at least every month or so

698
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,408
Possibly

699
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,688
MX

700
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,248
And the reason I say that is because

701
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:13,088
Gosh this is going way back I think the Microsoft Zune

702
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
Wood

703
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,904
Do that you could

704
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,232
Download stuff from your music apps for Microsoft

705
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,816
As long as you had your subscription pay the zoompass I think it was called

706
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
10 bucks a month or something

707
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:29,984
But you had to exert a check in from a different perspective at least once every 30 days or would not just

708
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
Cease working for you

709
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:36,384
And that was just to make sure your Pandora subscription witches and Spotify as a subscription service

710
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
Makes sense

711
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,944
Write this does only work

712
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
You pay for the

713
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
Spotify premium

714
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
Right

715
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,600
But if this need is something you guys have

716
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,904
I really recommend this product it's great

717
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
It's not really a coyote

718
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
But it's still connected

719
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,376
That's about it for us this week we shall

720
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:01,984
Take a moment for a message from our sponsor and after that we will have

721
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
Mike's Beer

722
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
From Honeywell talk to you about

723
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:09,664
Cybersecurity and how they think about it on the industrial iot

724
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
Plantside

725
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,504
Which is very different from how we think about it

726
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
In

727
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,320
I don't know the IT world or even the whole bar

728
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
But you can learn from it

729
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Yes you can

730
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
All right

731
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,584
Stay tuned for that and now a message from our sponsor everyone we are breaking into the

732
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,984
The Internet of Things podcast

733
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,520
From haikou

734
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,312
Hey Marcus how are you doing today

735
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,872
I'm doing great Stacy thanks so much for having me

736
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Excellent

737
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
Glad you're here so

738
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,016
Remind us all again what it is that high cosolutions

739
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,808
We are in advance

740
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:52,416
Iot engineering Solutions provider with Development Centers based in Eastern Europe

741
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:55,488
Recall primarily US based clients

742
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,560
By providing engineering teams that included numbers

743
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,608
Allowing us to help

744
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
Our partners

745
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,168

End and custom iot Solutions

747
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,848
All right so you mentioned that you guys come by the number of skills to build these teams

748
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
Can you talk about those

749
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,968
We really combined skill and what we describe is Three core areas

750
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,552
Number one embedded firmware in electrical engineering

751
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
So thank you

752

Component selection

754
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,744
Knowledge of the different Wireless protocols

755
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,792
Are there more standard or

756
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,840
Zigbee Z-Wave Lora

757
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,120
Amongst many others

758
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,936
Number to mathematical data processing

759
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,752
Do we have a team of phds focus

760
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,544
In discrete mathematics

761
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,616
Computational geometry statistical analysis

762
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,688
Really work on building custom algorithmics

763
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,760
Solutions using Advanced machine-learning Techniques

764
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,344
And the number 3 digital experience

765
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
Were suffering

766
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,440
Engineering we employed several hundred software engineers

767
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,720
Mosto

768
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,280
An educational background in mathematics

769
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,608
You working a plethora of different programming languages

770
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,912
For both mobile and web applications

771
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:10,752
Play end-to-end Solutions what we really mean is that

772
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
We combine all of these

773
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,384
Skills to build teams that help our clients with everything from

774
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
Designing the electronic

775
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,712
Components within a connected device

776
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:25,600
Using mathematicians to drive value out of a date of this coming from the sensors within those devices

777
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,208
Software engineering teams to build interfaces for those applications

778
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
I like it

779
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
So what is the typical client

780
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,840
Our clients come in all shapes and sizes

781
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Pittsburgh

782
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,400
Early industry agnostic

783
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
But we work with

784
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,472
Funded startups to the Fortune 50

785
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:47,360
What they generally have in common is that they're looking for highly Advanced engineering skill that is both difficult

786
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,664
And expensive to Source locally

787
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,528
They're generally looking for a partner who can ramp up teams within a few weeks at a very reasonable cost

788
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,832
I believe they find

789
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:01,440
The combination of skills in the number of things they can accomplish with one partner

790
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
Hard to find anywhere else

791
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,048
Excellent so where can we get more information

792
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,584
Website

793
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,936
Can get white papers case studies technology roadmaps project

Thank you Stacey

799
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,024
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Mike

800
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:40,608
Speaker who is a global operations manager for a

801
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,656
Industrial cybersecurity

802

Add Honeywell

803
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,520
Hi Stacy doing well thanks

804
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,848
Man I'm super excited to have you on the show because

805
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,384
I went to this

806
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,712
User group meeting and I saw you speak about

807
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,504
Cybersecurity and securing

808
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,784
Manufacturing

809
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
I was kind of Blown Away I was like

810
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,648
Wow they have a totally different

811
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,672
Threat landscape

812
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:10,048
And they're thinking about it in kind of a way that maybe it organization should also start

813
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
Matador other businesses who are dealing

814
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Coyote

815
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,168
So let's kick it off with

816
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,960
What year did charge of sick

817
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
What you doing

818
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:22,848
Okay well I'm responsible for the on-site delivery

819
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:26,432
Cyber Solutions for the industrial Market

820
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,480
Industrial Market as Define

821
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:32,320
Bios SB oil and gas refining

822
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,136
Petrochemical paper the processing

823
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:42,816
And we try to help is as you mentioned the operations technology is often referred to as the OT environment

824
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,608
Secure their systems

825
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,912
Balancing the need of

826
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,448
Conduction which is

827
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,264
Their Paramount importance and safety

828
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,056
With that of

829
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,592
Security tolerance

830
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:58,176
So I lead the team around the globe

831
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,224
That I'll go to the sides and

832
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
Meet with the customers understand

833
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,856
Risk tolerance risk appetite

834
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:12,256
And then we come up with the solutions that help them mitigate the levels of risk that they feel that Dane

835
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
I need to

836
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
Mitigate

837
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,328
Okay we're going to talk about

838
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
But good

839
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,448
Good that's why I signed up to come on the show

840
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,008
But first we're going to talk about

841
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,336
Process manufacturing vs. discrete manufacturing

842
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,640
Cuz it's possibly worth it to

843
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,456
Break this up because Manufacturing

844
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
Is the same

845
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
Can you

846
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,272
Kaplan

847
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,368
For me process Industries is that take something

848
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,440
L on the input side and I turn it into something

849
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,464
Altonio

850
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,256
Passat so I take off

851
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:50,656
A wood chips in on a paper I take wall in and I make gas I take chemicals in and I made

852
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
Pills

853
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,984
Where is discrete manufacturing

854
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,032
For me is more of an assembly

855
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,080
I'm putting a car together

856
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,616
I'm making an iPhone

857
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,664
The process Industries

858
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,736
Again more processing raw input

859
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:08,064
Into a usable while slightly different app

860
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,904
Okay in the process industry has had sensors

861
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,768
For a long time this is not new to start throwing sensors in in measuring

862
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,816
The stuff where is in other Industries

863
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
It might be

864
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,424
So what is actually changed with quote-unquote

865
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,448
The internet

866
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
Things

867
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,544
I think the Internet of Things is a hole

868
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
New future Direction

869
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
For the process

870
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,896
Streets again up until

871
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,200
We would say in the short history

872
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,784
The process Industries where or very proprietary environment

873
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,392
Meaning the communication between the sensors all the way up to the controls

874
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,928
Was a proprietary boss

875
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,000
Riesling and say the last 10 years or so

876
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:52,864
Cost and other factors in in in the need for additional information has driven

877
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,936
The industry to what they call the open architecture

878
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
Therein lies

879
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,752
The openness

880
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Of the structure

881
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,080
So so now everything once we brought the

882
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,128
Ethernet cable shall we say

883
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:08,736
To the plant for that opens up the capabilities in the flexibility

884
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:12,320
To do more get more information to optimize

885
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,672
Improve the security and safety of the overall environment

886
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,744
At what that also becomes the need then more

887
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,144
To get more of that information up to the business level so that businesses can make real-time decisions based

888
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,192
Directly down the what's going on

889
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,472
At the process

890
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,520
Level at the sensor level chart

891
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,056
All right

892
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,104
So you guys have been starting to

893
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,920
The old-school proprietary

894
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,200
Communications

895
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,248
Ran in factories for a while

896
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
With now

897
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,088
New school it

898
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:45,856
Ethernet

899
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
Specific word like stuff

900
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,768
Let's talk about how you thought about security

901
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,584
When you started this and what you're thinking about secure

902
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,632
Security now so how that perspective is change

903
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,680
Call gimatic Lychee

904
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:04,800
In the beginning with a proprietary system of the communication protocols

905
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:09,664
The access within the environment was the limited to those who understood the protocol

906
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,224
A noun with an open protocol or nope

907
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,552
Open system as we say where I be quote-unquote Centric

908
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:19,136
Now it's the same common language at the entire world

909
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,440
Uses weather as your bank or your

910
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,000
Financial systems use your Walmart

911
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,280
Shell gas station

912
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:30,144
All that technology it is very similar now most businesses

913
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,192
People I've been dealing with this for

914
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,264
For 20 years you know it's just now recently

915
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,312
The. Same technology has

916
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,360
Becoming dated into the plant

917
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,152
Floor now I'll be at

918
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,200
It's not a direct one to one

919
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,016
You can't do a lot of the things that the plant level

920
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:49,344
That you could for example on your business ID

921
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:56,000
One of the things that we use as an example for example if your it group want you to reboot your

922
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Workstation

923
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,864
That's a pretty non-invasive activity whereas that

924
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,400
Can a plant floor

925
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:06,240
Automatically rebooting A system can have very catastrophic country

926
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
So it has to be done with care

927
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:12,384
Same with God communication protocols in the interruptions of a

928
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,432
Of communication that the plant level

929
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
It can be

930
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,248
Much more

931
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
I'm a safety standpoint

932
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
Severe impacts then it would

933
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
If you lose

934
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,880
For example your email

935
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,208
Show me big big change at the at the plant level

936
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,256
Okay so now that you've brought this in

937
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,816
How do you educate

938
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,888
People in the it security world and then

939
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,960
How do you educate your existing security or

940
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,752
Even Personnel on the floor

941
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,032
How to behave cuz

942
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,312
The feels like

943
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,872
Your workers are probably really well-trained

944
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,920
Comes to safety issues like

945
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,968
Hey that's a bad hydrochloric acid

946
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,248
You probably shouldn't touch that

947
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
Maybe you should wear certain

948
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,600
Gear around it but when it comes to the IT world

949
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,160
Maybe they don't get the same things like hay

950
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,976
You should not send your bank account over email

951
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,512
Hopefully everyone knows that but

952
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Just in case

953
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
You'd be surprised

954
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,608
But absolutely I think

955
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,632
About definition

956
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
That they're different

957
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:11,264
Resources or are the people running the plants or are different mindset

958
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,104
Almost a process Focus chemical Engineers again

959
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,432
They're interested in making whatever it is they're making

960
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,200
They're not

961
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,808
Focus so much on on the it side because that's not something that deal with

962
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,392
Again the very leery of having the it

963
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:31,488
Their it group actually come in and do stuff at the plant level

964
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:37,888
That's one of the biggest things I think in the in the Takata I kind of gave that example of a anybody

965
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,912
Anaplan

966
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:42,496
It's a song of rickety old ladder leaned against the

967
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,544
A wall and somebody climbing up

968
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,104
50 lb bag

969
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,128
What's a haze

970
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
Call OSHA that's a safety has

971
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,528
But if they were walking in the parking lot and said the CEO salary

972
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,064
On a USB stick

973
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,880
999 would go in and plug it into the

974
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,696
Computer they don't have that same level of

975
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
Diligence

976
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,488
Governance

977
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,048
I at the plant level around these type

978
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
Security program

979
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,144
And that's one of the messages were trying to get out there

980
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,680
It's more than just

981
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,984
Putting in a firewall or or

982
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,568
Segmenting a network it's the people process technology

983
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,360
People are your biggest

984
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,408
Is one of your biggest risk factor

985
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,224
I am so this whole awareness

986
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,248
Educating

987
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
The plant people

988
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,832
On what to look for in what to do

989
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:32,160
And so that when events do happen they know exactly

990
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,696
The right reaction they say

991
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,464
She takes

992
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,328
To an event that may potentially cause severe damage to the to the plant and production inbox

993
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,888
In extreme circumstances safety

994
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,544
So how do you train people in what are the things you're trying to train your workers on when it comes to

995
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
Thai tea

996
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,895
It's two different training aspects that

997
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,431
When you refer to workers

998
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,479
19rr very

999
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,247
Specialized

1000
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
They are

1001
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:02,111
Typically this is very new in this space

1002
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,415
There's not a lot of people with 20 years ago

1003
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,975
Experience and in doing industrial it

1004
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,535
So we typically recruit from

1005
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:14,911
How did the industry and get the senior the set call an IT expert

1006
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:21,567
We bring them into our organization and and weedy to them and it take somewhere between 3 to 6

1007
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,871
Sometimes 9 months daddy totem

1008
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,663
Anybody to know Mommy

1009
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,455
Taking all that technology

1010
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:33,343
Experience and knowledge and certifications that you had any idea what all can modify them

1011
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,879
To apply them

1012
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:39,231
To the industrial world and it's only after they've gained the whole

1013
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,279
Knowledge of all those things

1014
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,607
Do we actually let him go out and actually service our customer

1015
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
Only

1016
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,655
Other side

1017
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
For our customers

1018
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,983
We're offering a variety of a

1019
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,031
We start with awareness training

1020
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,847
Again it goes to the whole concept of

1021
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:59,711
Your what should you do when what should you look for what are some of the basics around cyber

1022
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,759
You should be thinking about when you're

1023
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,295
Designing implementing

1024
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,367
Will purchasing a new control system

1025
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,159
. all the way up to

1026
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
For some of my mom

1027
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
Amateur customers

1028
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:16,351
You know I'm going to put in a Sim what does that look like lettuce train you on the advantages of us M LeSabre

1029
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
Versus

1030
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,167
You know another security control

1031
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,007
It ranges the whole gamut on the list, customer side

1032
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,823
Okay what are the biggest things you have to

1033
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
Your it

1034
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,895
Folks honor what are what are the things that they need

1035
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
The most help

1036
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:35,807
That's a lot of stuff I mean I got I want to get too technical lovey landing and some of the

1037
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,855
The technical things that you

1038
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
You can do

1039
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,183
An AIT environment

1040
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,207
You just cannot

1041
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
Do

1042
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,767
In a process environment

1043
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,327
Duda responsiveness this required

1044
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,423
Loss of view in a control system for a minute is a big deal

1045
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,471
You know where house if you're

1046
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,543
Screen at your laptop goes out for a minute it's

1047
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,335
Kinosaki end of the world

1048
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,663
In a plant it could cause catastrophic results

1049
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:05,759
So it's really training him around that it's awesome

1050
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,063
Walking into a plant that mean you going

1051
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,343
I'm very

1052
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,183
Hazardous areas you know how do you operate in these hazardous areas

1053
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,719
Think about it if I plug

1054
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
The cable

1055
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
In the wrong places

1056
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,327
Create a control Loop you know the impact of a

1057
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,143
Cover Refinery doing that versus

1058
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,447
Let's say seven eleven

1059
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,983
Is significantly different

1060
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,287
Okay that's kind of Awesome

1061
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,127
Let's talk about risk mitigation because

1062
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,687
Couple people I talk to you at this time

1063
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,223
You know I was asking him

1064
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,271
Very security questions and they were like

1065
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,831
Really Stacy this is a psychological issue

1066
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,671
It's basically how secure do you really feel like you need to be

1067
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,743
And once you get past that then you can say

1068
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,511
Your printer

1069
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,815
That's even an option

1070
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,863
To think about how secure you need to be

1071
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,167
That's crazy I just want to be secure

1072
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:00,543
Help me with the the industrial security mindset

1073
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,335
In terms of figuring out

1074
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,615
How to think about risk

1075
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,407
Risk is to as

1076
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,711
That's right you got risk tolerance which is

1077
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,527
You know how much can the business actually tolerate

1078
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:14,623
And in Risk appetite which is how much can you really afford to do

1079
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,415
Put it in comparison to your house

1080
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,207
You can lock your front door

1081
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,255
That may be a good real

1082
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,303
You can put bars on your windows

1083
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,607
You can put an alarm

1084
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:29,215
If you're trying to mitigate the risk against an assassin trying to shoot you

1085
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,263
They may be good things but you may want to wear

1086
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,287
Kevlar vest

1087
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,591
There's all these different Soul levels

1088
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,919
Depending on what it is you're trying to protect yourself against

1089
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,967
And in only the business

1090
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,247
Meaning the customer

1091
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
Can I answer that question

1092
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:48,159
My version of protection may be different than your version of protection

1093
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,743
So it is somewhat psychological shall we say but

1094
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,583
But more in terms of appetite versus watching the business take

1095
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,167
Can you afford to have this process line down for six weeks

1096
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,983
That type of and you have to do these type of a

1097
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,311
Mitigation Of valuations of risk calculation

1098
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,615
To determine what level of security

1099
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,663
That you need to implement in your sister

1100
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:14,271
Fciac 62443 which is kind of the guidelines for

1101
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,551
Control systems

1102
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,111
You know eat lays it out in terms of

1103
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,927
Who you trying to protect yourself against

1104
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:24,767
Are you trying to protect yourself against Stacy who may come in and

1105
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,351
Accidentally plug your laptop into the control system

1106
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:32,959
And her husband was playing Star Wars or some game on the

1107
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,799
I dated myself there with with their laptop and infection

1108
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
The system

1109
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,847
Or are you trying to

1110
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,663
Protect yourself against node in there somebody that's

1111
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:46,783
You're trying to do harmful within the walls or are you trying to protect yourself from a nation

1112
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,623
State each of these once you determine what you're trying to protect yourself again

1113
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,927
Then there's a set of mitigating controls

1114
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,207
Did you can implement

1115
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,231
Good rest

1116
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:00,351
One of the interesting things that we tried to tell everybody because they get hung up in this hole

1117
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,655
Conversation around you know

1118
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,935
Do I bake a

1119
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,239
Bull the world world or do I just

1120
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
Take a drink

1121
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
38

1122
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,591
Percent what we found 3835

1123
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:15,455
Of the attacks or or issues that we find or we called involved in

1124
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,015
Originate within the four walls of the plant

1125
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,319
Know what does that mean that means

1126
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:25,951
It's either an innocent employee doing something of vendor coming in doing something which by the way

1127
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:30,303
In these plants vendors are in there every day and then he's Control Systems they need access to

1128
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,863
Control system did you updates to do

1129
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,471
Repairs things like that or disgruntled employee so there's a set of controls

1130
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:40,287
And procedures in in governance around

1131
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,079
Protecting yourself at that level

1132
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:46,943
Some parts of the world and then our customers that we deal with are really targeted by Nation

1133
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,991
The states so therefore we have to do

1134
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,783
Significantly more

1135
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,855
Protective type of litigation strategy for those

1136
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,903
So it's not a one-size-fit-all

1137
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
Speaking of Nations

1138
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,487
There's a lot of attention right now.

1139
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,767
Hacks

1140
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:05,375
Nation states and different types of attacks may be using tools from

1141
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,727
DSA perhaps so things like wannacry notpetya

1142
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,543
All of that feels

1143
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,335
Like everyone's more aware of

1144
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:17,663
So how does that change the environment you guys operate

1145
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,735
I think the positive from our side is

1146
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,015
You know we've been

1147
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,063
We've been seeing this as you mentioned for years

1148
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,855
But now that's brought it to a

1149
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,391
Different level of awareness

1150
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,695
Now we're seeing that the

1151
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,511
Plants in the people that are involved in this

1152
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,071
Are now looking and saying hey wait a second

1153
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,911
This is happening in the industrial space this could happen to me

1154
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,703
What are we doing

1155
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,495
We get called in Austin

1156
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,311
How the cause of an executive is asked

1157
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
The plant

1158
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,919
What are we doing are we protected against the wannacry

1159
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,199
In the plant goes

1160
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,247
I'm not sure but that's the wrong answer

1161
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:57,343
The right so the awareness level has increased dramatically I would say

1162
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,623
In the last six

1163
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
The 12 months

1164
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,439
I am by that they're coming to

1165
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:04,767
Companies like Honeywell going very been doing this for a while

1166
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,559
And saying hey where do we start

1167
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,095
I think that's the biggest

1168
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,655
Challenge for most of the people we talked to

1169
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,935
I want cyber

1170
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,703
Security

1171
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:18,079
To your point earlier do I want the $5,000 Scott cybersecurity other $5000000

1172
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,895
Which do I need a don't know where to start

1173
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:27,295
In companies like Honeywell we can come in and say okay let's talk about this look at your risk mitigation watch

1174
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,903
I didn't come up with a solution that's that helps him get started

1175
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,183
But the bottom line

1176
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,463
Is the awareness is a

1177
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,255
Increased significantly

1178
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,791
And that has helped everybody

1179
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,583
To actually put in the action

1180
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,375
Could start getting their system secure

1181
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,167
This is kind of an interesting

1182
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,959
Idea but let's say you've got

1183
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,263
An oil refinery and maybe it's it's

1184
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,055
Crucial oil refinery

1185
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,591
Of supplying

1186
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,383
I don't know part of the United States

1187
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:57,247
And they pick a risk mitigation plan that feels maybe like

1188
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:58,783
Not enough

1189
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:02,111
So what is your role as someone who consults with these guys

1190
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,647
In that case and then

1191
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,951
Where should the funding

1192
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,071
Our role is that of

1193
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
Alyssa is a

1194
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,375
Trusted advisor

1195
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,423
I mean we're going to tell them

1196
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
What we think

1197
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,775
Is there right mitigation strategy

1198
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,335
And it will be based on the standards

1199
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,359
On these

1200
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:27,967
Market levels that we seen with other customers so kind of gives them a point of reference

1201
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,527
We see the funding coming from

1202
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,367
A couple different sources sometimes corporate funds it

1203
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:37,183
Sometimes the actual plants are left to find it

1204
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,207
Because at the end

1205
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,255
If the direct correlation

1206
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,279
Who is two products

1207
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,327
Self is more of a

1208
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,631
Protection cost on on production

1209
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:50,239
State funded on objects at times other times depending on what it is you're doing

1210
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,311
They may have to come out of capex or some multiple sources

1211
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
On the funding

1212
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,383
If I was your question

1213
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:59,711
Yeah I know that part of me wonders

1214
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:04,575
If you have a process that baby doesn't feel essential but

1215
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,623
To be polluting or something if it were

1216
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,695
Or preached and then have a severe detrimental effect

1217
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:15,583
And nuclear power is kind of something everyone's worried about right but it could even be you know

1218
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,863
Paper mill

1219
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,399
Killing a river I don't know

1220
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,495
It may not become a financial priority for

1221
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,031
Plant operators

1222
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,055
End

1223
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,335
That feels like

1224
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,151
A question we should all be thinking about as we

1225
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,431
Things online

1226
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:35,807
Absolutely in you and you see around the globe many countries now

1227
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,855
Are passing regulatory

1228
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,879
Tissues that

1229
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,695
If you have a Cyber attack in a critical in

1230
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
The structure

1231
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,743
Impact

1232
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,791
The economy or whatever then

1233
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,583
The plants are being liable

1234
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,143
I'll see you at we're seeing a growing increase

1235
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,959
Round the global of regulatory

1236
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:56,031
Compliancy type of a requirement Chalisa

1237
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,871
And I think you're going to see that increase increase to your point

1238
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,663
That makes it

1239
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,943
Skin in the game show

1240
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,271
Where do you see these regulations happening

1241
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,319
Fastest or where do you look at

1242
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,903
Could you like hey these guys are actually building a really good model for reggae

1243
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,183
This sort of thing

1244
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:19,583
By far the deleters are some of the countries in the Middle East again they're in a different

1245
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,143
Meaning of environment

1246
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,167
Did that maybe

1247
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,471
Some of the other parts of the world

1248
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,007
I know of France

1249
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,799
In Europe there also

1250
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,615
I'll coming on board pretty rapidly

1251
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:36,223
I'm in the u.s. is doing some things nurx Elf on the power side

1252
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:39,807
Canada on S pasta are pushing some of their

1253
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,087
About Alberta

1254
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,135
Compliance nurx F-Type

1255
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:47,231
So it's it's running the glow but but if you had to say you know who was the

1256
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,255
The ones that

1257
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,047
I would have to

1258
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,071
To say the middle of Base

1259
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
All right

1260
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,399
And words of wisdom

1261
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:57,727
4 people in the it side we're looking at the

1262
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,543
Plant as a source of Revenue

1263
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,103
Wow we should just get in there

1264
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:07,199
These guys are so old school and we could make this awesome for them

1265
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,735
What would you say to her

1266
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:14,623
Look before you leap again I as I mentioned earlier in the end of discussion

1267
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,671
The Technologies of the same

1268
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,951
The applications are

1269
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,487
Significantly different

1270
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:22,303
And the consequences are significantly differ

1271
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,911
Part of what we bring to the party is is we

1272
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,703
Bring both git knowledge

1273
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,007
And what we call the process knowledge

1274
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:35,103
And the two combined is what you need to actually

1275
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,407
Work in this thing called the OT environment

1276
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,735
All right

1277
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:44,319
Mike thank you so much for coming on the show.

1278
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,855
Haha you're welcome

1279
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,415
That's it for this week's show

1280
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:54,815
