Jeep

36
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,000
Deep winter there for you but here in Austin Texas it is the first day of spring

37
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
It is not the first day of spring

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
What about you

39
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:18,496
I'm feeling tired because we're getting pounded with snow and we shovel like every 2 hours

40
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,568
Where is our smart snow plow version of

41
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
The snow plow

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272
Let's talk about data protection because

43
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
Because this week's big story

44
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,976
Misuse of

45
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,536
By Cambridge Analytics

46
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
US election

47
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
And this is

48
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,936
Use of Facebook data so they actually use data that they didn't have permission to you

49
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,496
Used to Target people

50
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Well

51
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:58,688
A lot of people originally said this was a data breach it was not a data breach the system

52
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
Facebook system

53
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
Platform work as intended

54
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
However

55
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
Cambridge analytica

56
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,368
Putting out like a quiz app

57
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,696
That approximately 270000 people took

58
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
It got data from

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
Friends of

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
Yours

61
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,936
And as a result the report is it actually was able to creep

62
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,496
Profiles of 50 million people

63
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,568
Even though not technically people use the quiz app

64
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
And again that is

65
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
Within Facebook

66
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
Acceptable

67
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,784
Or technically possible Facebook

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
For many people

69
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Think about

70
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,160
Your craziest Facebook friend probably your aunt

71
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
Who you're just like

72
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
What are you doing

73
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,304
That person

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,608
Is opening you up to all kinds of craziness

75
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
And also Cambridge Analytics

76
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,984
They did live right about saying

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
When they had

78
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Correct

79
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,920
Correctamente

80
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
For you is

81
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
4 very specific

82
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,528
Targeting of Facebook ads

83
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
And

84
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,904
The targets were built on the profiles that they created for everybody

85
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
Also Those ads

86
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,536
Well well say steak using Those ads but then again political ads

87
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Often have

88
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,375
Information that is questionable or

89
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
It's designed to sway

90
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
Yes

91
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
The dark

92
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
Did you know

93
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
That candidate X

94
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
Let murderers loose early

95
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,783
What look like legitimate news stories in that same tone

96
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Witches

97
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
It's harder for

98
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,695
The reason we're talking about this isn't

99
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Because

100
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
Facebook

101
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,047
It's because we think the story helps

102
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,655
It helps legitimize what has been a long-standing concern that we had about

103
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
All of the dated it

104
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
Uart connected devices

105
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,591
Everything from Cars to light bulbs to

106
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:08,479
If you're at home if you're not when you typically leave the house so on so forth you

107
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
We don't have

108
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:15,903
Good protections for this and a lot of data is

109
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Please

110
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,255
So this story presents a really calm

111
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,791
Concrete evidence of

112
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
Why that's

113
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,607
Something we should be looking at

114
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Tell that much

115
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
But they can actually tell us

116
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,519
And they can I share this with a lot of pee

117
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,103
And so Kevin and I were talking about our Smart Home

118
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
Kevin was like

119
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
So they

120
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,711
Are the Camp Hill Democrat

121
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Profiles

122
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Pretty interesting

123
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,879
Kashmir Hill actually did a story about

124
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
I have some of that might develop

125
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Kind of Lifestyle

126
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:07,359
Most of the devices we do talk about you can't use unless you are willing to provide that information to

127
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,895
Whoever the service provider is

128
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,175
That is true

129
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,247
And that's one of those things like the gdpr that European

130
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,551
Regulations about privacy

131
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
Actually talked about

132
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
If

133
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
You are providing

134
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,951
A device or service indeed

135
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
Is part of that

136
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
The person has to be able to opt out

137
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
In some reason

138
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
And I think that's going to be

139
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,935
I really enjoy I'm interested to see how they actually improve

140
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,983
You put something on a package before

141
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,543
By the way that we're going to collect

142
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,359
I guess because I would like

143
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
Actually I would think

144
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
I really easily

145
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
Understandable

146
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
Sharing

147
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
Sticker

148
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
On the device

149
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Helpful

150
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
And then I'd be like

151
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
I don't want to buy this

152
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,231
It's one thing for Google to say

153
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,535
But it's pretty easy to switch over some

154
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Purses

155
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,399
Once I've installed something I brought it home and packed it from

156
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
And then I see that they want

157
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,007
All this extra data

158
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
Restocking fee

159
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
Aha

160
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:17,247
Yeah it's definitely tougher with physical devices to know that in advance

161
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
What happens

162
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
And this is a really interesting

163
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
Because it might become relevant for life

164
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,159
I bought my

165
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
In terms of service

166
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
When Nest peking

167
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,815
Google Google

168
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
Those receipts

169
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
But

170
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
Let us know if it changes

171
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
If they change it

172
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
How likely are people

173
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
Jack to this

174
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
Thermostat off

175
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Off the wall

176
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,175
It's basically a

177
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
The barriers of change

178
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,575
New updated terms of service

179
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Art

180
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
Now that's what I call them

181
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Amazon

182
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
Just a few weeks ago on that and like

183
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
Oh well

184
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
Dice clicked yes but

185
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,031
Took them for my wall several months later and try to return

186
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
I would like to see these companies along with the

187
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:20,735
Neely's of a terms of service provide a simple checklist of what's new compared to what

188
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
You know what the original tale as well as

189
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
Get on it dies

190
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Okay

191
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
So there

192
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,743
And let's move to another anti-consumer

193
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Qual work while we're on this

194
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Smart Home

195
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
Lockn

196
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:41,471
Kevin this is a really good article over on Fast Company that willing to in the show notes

197
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:46,847
Jared Newman wrote it and he knows his stuff.

198
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,015
Google and Amazon in the past and he talks about why that is

199
00:08:54,271 --> 00:09:00,415
And it has to do with standards and such she has to do with apis which article on last week one of his

200
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
Key

201
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
Areas in Antarctica

202
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,559
You can talk to me but I won't talk to you

203
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,863
It's interesting how the approaches that different

204
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Smart Home

205
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:15,007
IPhones have taken like will provide you can talk to us but we're not going to send you anything back

206
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,799
It's really rather interesting

207
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:21,919
Jared has spoken weapons in the Articles you can read it but he has spoken with some of the

208
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
Standards groups that we have

209
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,575
How about we talk about a new one which kind of poo poo in butt

210
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,463
No it's an option in that was the network of intelligent camera ecosystem nice the alliance that just came about

211
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:39,327
But also the OCS we talked about before the open to be Foundation

212
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
They're all in here and they're trying to

213
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
Can do

214
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,031
To try and make this a better and easier so that way we do have standards and we don't have lock-in

215
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:53,407
You know

216
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:57,247
Say with homekit I think it's the most lockdownd ecosystem and that's why

217
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,831
Devices to choose from because the manufacturers

218
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,159
Don't want to just Target a certain demographic

219
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,583
Sonic racing

220
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,423
Yeah yeah

221
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,703
Change it

222
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Your device

223
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
The capabilities of your device switch

224
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Probably frustrating

225
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,895
Absolutely

226
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,455
Something a Google effort that kind of reduces

227
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
I will call it

228
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
Strong

229
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:37,695
Competitor a strong service provider in the sales everywhere talk about that

230
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,303
One of the things in this article they did a lot on the ocf

231
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
Which is

232
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:48,447
Connectivity Foundation

233
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,543
Where they're trying to focus

234
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,871
There which I think is really good so get

235
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,199
This is what a light bulb is so every light bulb will come

236
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Basic

237
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,271
I would like

238
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,831
I have dimming capabilities maybe it'll

239
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
Encompass the color capabilities

240
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,951
And that'll all be standardized across all of them

241
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,047
Something like Google or Amazon

242
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
Or any of the other plants

243
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Pomsky just tired to that

244
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,399
I would love to see that

245
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,935
I've been wanting this

246
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
Or

247
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,799
Decades

248
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
But it's

249
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
It's incredibly

250
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
It's a device capabilities

251
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
And I wonder

252
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
I wonder how

253
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,575
Don't know this will happen I wonder if that will obviate the need for a

254
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,135
In the Smart Hub

255
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,695
Theoretically

256
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,023
But yes will it well actually I don't know

257
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,095
I think you always need a hug because you'll need the extra

258
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,399
Shooting because this isn't going to solve the issue of life

259
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
Like reading like this Unified

260
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,239
Platform everything that you should have power

261
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,543
So you're still going to want a hug for local cab

262
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
Computing of tasks prop

263
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Automation

264
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Which

265
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
Kevin you wrote about last

266
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
So

267
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,527
Yes so you're still going to need

268
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Which is fine

269
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
But you don't need 20

270
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
Thank goodness

271
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
Ziggy does have some

272
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
Call.

273
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,231
Ocf is working on something

274
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
We was going to do this but

275
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
More so

276
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,911
Maybe maybe there's an OCS

277
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
Standardized

278
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
What they put their seal of approval on

279
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
Ocf

280
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359
But you would also have to buy ocf

281
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Lights for

282
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
You know they said they were going to have stuff

283
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Last year

284
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
They didn't

285
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:44,415
So there are no but this year supposedly we are promised ocf products

286
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,975
Coming out so we'll start seeing this and we'll see

287
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Actually works

288
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
Will let you know

289
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Because

290
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Right now

291
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
It sucks

292
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,055
My criteria for connected devices now is it needs to work with Amazon Echo

293
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
The Google Assistant

294
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
If I were a iPhone user

295
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
I probably wanted to work with

296
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
Trinidad

297
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
That's like very low on the totem pole since then

298
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,343
Homekit implementation is not awesome

299
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
Also I don't have a knife

300
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,255
I'm getting from the station isn't bad it's actually

301
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,095
Quite good baking really kept it simple by staying with just Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

302
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
Because

303
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,703
Device makers and not put all their products out

304
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
4

305
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
It support

306
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
That's true

307
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,823
Kevin is going to be a resident

308
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
Kiddush home

309
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Good luck Kevin

310
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,551
All right if you're I I want to talk about this cuz this is something I

311
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
I am in the middle of

312
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,695
Probably talk a little bit more about this but I am doing an iot Smart Home Spring

313
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:55,071
And I'm going to recommend that if you're like me test a lot of Criterion capabilities

314
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,607
Did you look at this

315
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,447
So I've noticed in the last couple months that things are just

316
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,287
There are things that just don't work there devices on my network

317
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,847
So what I did is I went through

318
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,919
I looked at what I had in my house

319
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
Anything we didn't have

320
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
Like that was

321
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
Anything we weren't using

322
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
I deleted the app

323
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,623
I deleted my in when I delete the app I delete

324
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
Authorized every

325
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,511
Everything I try to delete as much data as possible if it's possible

326
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
And took a device unplugged

327
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,679
Set it aside so once I have done all that

328
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
Appleton East

329
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
That wasn't working

330
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
Write this down

331
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
Deleted all my devices for the Amazon

332
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
I deleted all my devices in

333
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
Google

334
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
And

335
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,319
It is part of re-adding them

336
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,183
Implemented I spent like four hours doing some routines on both systems

337
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
To make life a little bit more

338
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
More fun for people

339
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,047
And it's been kind of a sucky

340
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,607
But necessary process it's taking a while

341
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,167
Have two more things that don't work even

342
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,727
Through the massive reboot a couple things actually did come back

343
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
Because

344
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
You may be asking

345
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Maybe moving stuff around

346
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
In

347
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
It's kind of nice to have a fresh slate

348
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,015
I don't disagree with a question though

349
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,879
Did you hard reset the physical devices that you took off even light bulbs

350
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
If I took

351
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,231
Them off and there was a hard reset button

352
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,327
I did the order of operations for this was I looked at the app

353
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
IDI Thrice the app

354
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
I did a hard reset

355
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
I deleted the app

356
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,543
Okay I'm just thinking because even a lightbulb

357
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
She don't

358
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
Oh yes you can

359
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,503
I don't have any Philips Hue but like my Cree bulbs

360
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,319
Am I awesome bulb there is a process to reset them

361
00:15:54,623 --> 00:16:00,767
Oh yeah yeah yeah

362
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,143
Would any device still have say my Wi-Fi credentials somewhere

363
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
Buy some device providers don't take

364
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Your Wi-Fi

365
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,311
Information

366
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:18,943
So deleting the account or removing a device from the provider should do that

367
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,343
It's a reminder concerned I just wouldn't want somebody having like the MAC address of my router you know by poking around somehow and

368
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,647
You can poke around in the code of the bulbs

369
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,095
So if you have the

370
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,631
Google how to reset

371
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,655
AG smart light

372
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
Sometimes you can reset them by accident

373
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Can children because

374
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
Most of the receptor

375
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
Put the lights on and off really rapidly 6 times

376
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
Do it again

377
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
Amazingly

378
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,735
My child

379
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
A couple times

380
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
It's possible rare

381
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
Smart home screen

382
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,279
Clean

383
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
Couple hours and

384
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
Your home is not going to work

385
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Like it should

386
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
Family or set aside

387
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
And

388
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
At the end

389
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
You will have a brand-new shiny

390
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
Less glitchy smart

391
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
That's what you're working

392
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
Anything you don't have glitches right now

393
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
You don't need to do it

394
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,479
I ready

395
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
Speaking of

396
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,063
My first thing I added after all my routines

397
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Amazon

398
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Echoes

399
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Barismo

400
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
Yeah you might have heard of its record as a follow-up mode and what it does is if you enable it when you

401
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,399
Speak a command to madam she will chords

402
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
Do not come in

403
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:48,287
But if this mode is enabled she will also listen for additional 5 Seconds

404
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
So you can just

405
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,127
Say another command without saying the Wake word I think it's

406
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,223
Super handy some people may not want it to continue to listen for 5 seconds

407
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:01,343
Because of privacy concerns I totally get that so Choose Or Not choose this mode based on your preferences

408
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,951
You do this in the app there's in your device settings in the united pay app

409
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,511
But interesting what you did it in the app

410
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
This morning Stacy

411
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
I didn't do it in the app

412
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:17,727
What freaked me out when this went live when I went out to go for a run at 9 one night nobody was

413
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:23,871
Awake so I just told me today to turn the family room lights down 50% I didn't even at full Blair because

414
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
Nobody was in the living room

415
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
And she said to me

416
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,479
I have a new follow-up mode

417
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,295
Would you like to enable and she explained what it was to me

418
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,831
And I enable it by choice

419
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,951
Yeah I love that

420
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,047
I must be special

421
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,863
Please to her

422
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,215
Maybe somebody Will Smith

423
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
She knows that I'm spitting

424
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
But it works really well

425
00:18:54,335 --> 00:19:00,479
I have it on.

426
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,039
So I don't think it's being held back

427
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:07,647
Specifically to Amazon bill devices obviously it's not because the sun has has it so

428
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,695
It's in there you can enable if you like

429
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,023
Awesome alright speaking voice assistance

430
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
IBM

431
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,863
Has a new smart assistant it is

432
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
Watson assistant

433
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
Go figure

434
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
Talk about

435
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,687
Emma Watson

436
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,783
No but it's actually pretty good name if I had like

437
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
Holmes and Watson

438
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,975
So what this is is this is an ID

439
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
Voice assistant

440
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
I didn't have a ton of cool Watson and

441
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:52,191
Products

442
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Conference

443
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
IBM news

444
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
Watson is not

445
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Design for

446
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
Consumer-facing stuff

447
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:03,455
It's going to be mostly operate behind the scenes for other companies so

448
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:07,295
Which is working with Watson Kindle

449
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
Commands for cars

450
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,879
And Watson also wants to do it now

451
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,159
Hotel rooms

452
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,183
Stores

453
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
The store in retail setting

454
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
It's a little confusing for

455
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
A Watson

456
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,215
Store assistant master store planner

457
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,007
What engine do I have

458
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,287
In Spring

459
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,151
So I think this is kind of interesting

460
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
Hockey

461
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
Two people

462
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:44,159
And probably

463
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,047
Really unlimited even though it's trying to do Amazon for business

464
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
Business on the side

465
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,191
Right cuz there's a lot of things you think about like admin access was access to certain

466
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
Information

467
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,519
You know anyone can walk into a room and asked

468
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,335
So I'm sure as hell

469
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
RPM sticking

470
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,407
About the architecture of the back

471
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
People access

472
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
Emission control circuit

473
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
Isis

474
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
Interesting to see what comes of it

475
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,111
Yeah I don't want like my passenger like sometimes you know you're driving

476
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Time with your kids and I

477
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,440
Friends

478
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
My car

479
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,304
A lot of types

480
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
All the time

481
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,472
Maybe doing a voice assistant in the car letting them change stuff or painted cooler

482
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
Nope

483
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
Air condition is just fine

484
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
IBM also announced

485
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
Type

486
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,760
Chip that is designed to

487
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,576
As part of its crypto anchor program so

488
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:50,976
It's basically like a digital birth certificates digital watermarks for devices the quilting here isn't that a

489
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
Super super tiny

490
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
Although it is

491
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:57,120
The cool thing is that they're talking about it's selling for what is like $0.10 a piece

492
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,192
Which does put it in the realm of

493
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
Many applications

494
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:05,312
Call zlata X

495
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
You should

496
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
A5x the cost of

497
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
For the hardware is

498
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
Just Fur

499
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,992
All that stuff that goes around the hardware integrated

500
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
Get into

501
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
But that's still

502
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,880
Let's go back to the home for a little bit

503
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
Because you can now

504
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,208
We got details about how

505
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,256
Google is thinking about shopping

506
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,816
And I was going to respond to the Amazon

507
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,936
Which is pretty huge and Google already got some big retailers lineup because

508
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,752
Amazon is the scariest thing ever

509
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
Shopping

510
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Assistant

511
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:44,736
Yeah I think this is brilliant it's a very defensive play on Google's part against Amazon

512
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,832
Search Google for products to buy

513
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:53,696
Apparently 72 80% of those searches need you to Amazon where people make

514
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:59,072
Purchase so since Google

515
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:03,424
Antitrust concerns and such what they've done is they've integrated

516
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,216
Google Assistant shopping

517
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
With Google Express

518
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,408
Interesting way if you do say to your assistant I like to buy whatever I'll coffee cup

519
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,968
Amazon results are little scarce there

520
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,296
Very interesting so what Google doing as they work with

521
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
Retail Partners

522
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
2

523
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
Show up in a search results

524
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,184
And then use Google expressed actually

525
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,208
Complete the purchase

526
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
I think it's

527
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,584
Super super smart because obviously for using an Amazon Echo

528
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,912
Or any matinee device to search for Crocs to buy

529
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
Where is it going to rain

530
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,520
Amazon

531
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,920
Can't do that with Google Now you can I just I think it's a brilliant brilliant move on Google

532
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,968
Yes I do too so

533
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,040
Do you want to talk to people like I was a little fish trying to figure out how

534
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Because

535
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:02,048
Well I mean you do a search through Google Assistant for a product and you'll get various results and she like you can add any of those

536
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,352
Google Express card

537
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,168
It doesn't look to me like you can actually complete the purchase

538
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
Google assistant

539
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,920
What happens if you

540
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
It gives you tells you

541
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,736
After you've selected something

542
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,528
You can slide in your life that's pretty cool

543
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,344
You can add it to your cart and then it gives it says

544
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,392
Okay this is in your cart you can find it

545
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,720
At this URL or it gives you the option to check out if

546
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:34,560
Except checkout is going to send you to the Google assistant app

547
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
The express app

548
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
Where you can't

549
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:43,520
It's not a fool and then purchase implementation yet but I got to believe that that's the next step

550
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
Which is good because

551
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,480
He just bought five things that you really don't need

552
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:57,344
Women's short sleeve red t-shirt

553
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,160
The first result actually was from Amazon

554
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
And it told me that

555
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744
Periodically

556
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,816
Search result is from Amazon.

557
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,656
Which was unlike any of the other search results

558
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Interested

559
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,008
Maybe it mean depend on the product

560
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,568
In which case they don't have a retailer with a grape

561
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,640
Deal or or stock or who knows what

562
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,200
I don't think they're locking Amazon out

563
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,760
I think that would be a problem

564
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,088
Yes alright also in Google News late last week after

565
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Done

566
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,136
Recording the show

567
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:36,256
Is now available

568
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
The video doorbell

569
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,656
Is the nest hello doorbell it is going to be 200

570
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
$30

571
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,752
So much money for a doorbell

572
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,824
You also will have to pay for nest aware cloud

573
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
If you

574
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
That it is a wired doorbell

575
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
So

576
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Note that

577
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
Not battery power

578
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:01,088
Does the service fee does that count with your nest aware

579
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,416
Or he has to pay extra

580
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
IMG

581
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,792
So what will happen is I will ask

582
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,584
So whenever we talk about

583
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,656
Hello doorbell which should be either next week or the week after depending

584
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
When it arrives when I get it installed

585
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
I shall have it answer

586
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
Also

587
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,056
The clock is come

588
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
Well

589
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,408
A little sad because this particular version of the Yale lock

590
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
Will not work with

591
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,784
So it's not like the August lock which works with

592
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
All of the

593
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
All of the

594
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,928
Yeah I'm seeing the same lock come out for different plaster

595
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,280
It's the worst absolutely the worst

596
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
Don't

597
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:49,216
Try that and we'll be able to look at the Google Assistant smart display stuff

598
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
We're out in the market

599
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,032
Because I'd love to be able to

600
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
So I guess I could try to

601
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,896
You certainly could because I tell my

602
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
Nvidia Shield

603
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:02,272
TV which is an Android TV and Chromecast

604
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
Assistant built-in

605
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,112
Show my Nest Cam and it just started up on my TV

606
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,584
Because the Chromecast devices can actually turn the TV on so you can if you're not

607
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,376
Watching TV at the time you can just

608
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,728
Letv model and show it

609
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,752
OMG

610
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
Also going to break all the sprinkler

611
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,408
I did probably but that's okay

612
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,992
Because that's my life

613
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
Stay tuned for

614
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,880
But if you don't want to wait for us to talk about it you can just go and buy it cuz they are

615
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,952
Alright let's move into the

616
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:46,304
Quick

617
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
My stuff

618
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
And we talked for a really

619
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,192
So here's an interesting Google Project Pat

620
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,752
Sidewalk Labs which alphabet

621
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,568
Smart City effort

622
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:01,152
Map of San Francisco's parking rules

623
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:06,016
What you be like will why did they do that well if you need to know where you can

624
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:12,416
Stop for deliveries or maybe you're an Uber driver need to know where you can sit for a few minutes and not have to pay

625
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
Pay for parking

626
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,000
It's all there in this information

627
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Unique

628
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
Because normally

629
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,840
Disable apps tell you

630
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,912
Has spots available

631
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,472
This is not that

632
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,008
Could help fill with City

633
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
Planning for

634
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,080
Different parking rules in areas

635
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
Speaking of

636
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,944
Cars we would be remiss if we didn't talk about Uber self-driving

637
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
Car killing a woman

638
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
This week

639
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
In Arizona

640
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,808
So we don't have a lot

641
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,832
To say about this but

642
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,672
Well you know obviously so very sad statue

643
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:51,328
And for that individual in the family so far the preliminary results

644
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,680
There was no way for the car to avoid this pedestrian

645
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:02,080
There was a driver in the car not driving a car they were in the driver seat in Uber person

646
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,640
So far based on the information

647
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,944
Not even the smart technology of The Economist

648
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,016
Vehicle could have avoided this point would be

649
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,344
We can't just assume autonomous vehicles will

650
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,136
Completely eradicate these type of

651
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
Of incidence

652
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:22,816
It's unfortunate but we can't do that because some things just happened so fast that not even the computing power in the car

653
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,888
I can handle it to make a change of swerve etcetera so

654
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:30,496
I don't want people to think of time this car will make everything safer 100% of the time

655
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,288
Right there real world physics

656
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,616
A car going is going around 40 miles an hour

657
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,664
If you step in front of any car

658
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,736
Going at it will try to break which this car did not

659
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:45,600
But there's a bunch of random this in the world that cannot be predicted and anticipated and

660
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,720
Yep all right moving to Industrial iot

661
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
Shofar horn

662
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,352
Startup has partnered with Google's iot core

663
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,144
To do stream

664
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,728
Data processing at the edge

665
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
All Google Solutions

666
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,544
Basically so

667
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,616
Does have Partnerships with Microsoft azure

668
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,200
And AWS this is a little deeper integration

669
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
Basically

670
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:18,368
And it's important to note Foghorn systems does so it has built a complex event processing engine

671
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,928
For the edge it's kind of like Apache Spark

672
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,720
Only instead of

673
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,256
Run across so many

674
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,560
Compute nodes it's designed to run in

675
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
One-place Solana Center

676
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,376
And

677
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,216
Bunch of different machine learning models

678
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,008
On the Foghorn software

679
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
It's nice

680
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
I believe GE is a customer

681
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Incel

682
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
The partnership with

683
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,760
Google basically makes girls offering

684
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
A little bit

685
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,832
Deeply integrated

686
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,624
With for industrial

687
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,696
Clients in this is a big deal for Google cuz right now

688
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
It feels like

689
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Very few

690
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
Industrial players are using

691
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
Google's iot

692
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:04,448
Yeah we talked about Google's iot strategy and how it's a mishmash of products that don't

693
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,240
Are presented well as a

694
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,288
Has one solution

695
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:11,104
This actually is I hope Google is talking about

696
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:15,456
They're using Cloud vaping Foghorn they're using Cloud iot Core

697
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,992
To gather information

698
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,784
But then Google Cloud pubsub

699
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,416
Is Kathryn dating

700
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,000
Data studio is all used for the analytics to make sense of that data

701
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,816
So this is a whole bunch of Google products

702
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,400
That please Google should be shouting off the rooftops

703
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,472
Yeah it's basically Google's got all the smarts in the cloud

704
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,056
Certain types of smarts at the edge that need

705
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,360
We've all talked Ad nauseam about the

706
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
Right so

707
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,688
Google doesn't really have much of a

708
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
Play here

709
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
Yet

710
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
This gets it

711
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,296
Joshua

712
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
So

713
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,208
In other Industrial iot

714
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
Has

715
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:03,072
Put out a piece of Hardware now this is a company resume software

716
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:07,168
It allows you to run containers at the edge so things like docker

717
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,728
Can run on laser-based systems

718
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,520
What day did the original

719
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
People got excited

720
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
About the stuff

721
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,384
And it basically lets you

722
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,736
Easy to implement software across hundreds or thousands of

723
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,528
Devices which is really important

724
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
And really hard so it makes it worse

725
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
Cloudlex

726
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,368
Brake calipers

727
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Yay

728
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,696
Necessary what they've done is a hardware

729
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,744
They have created projects

730
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,840
It is a board that stacks on top of a Raspberry Pi

731
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,632
Compute module 3 Lite

732
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,424
And basically it gives it

733
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
Industrial

734
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Capabilities

735
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,520
So some of those capabilities are

736
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
Separate

737
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:49,408
Bluetooth processor that can send data even without waking up the main

738
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,944
Model so it's low power

739
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:55,808
It is designed to work in industrial environments which is

740
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,344
You salty cuz these are

741
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Crappy environments there loud

742
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,904
Vibration

743
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
Hot

744
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
All kinds of stuff

745
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,024
It will take an external antenna for WiFi

746
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,352
And you can have power from 6 volts or 30 volts

747
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,888
Titus Industrial

748
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:17,056
There's even a SIM card slot seafood and I got a cellular modem not something you can easily do on a Raspberry Pi buy sell

749
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,104
So lots of cool stuff

750
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,408
They will still work on a bunch of other

751
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,480
They just wanted to offer this because they saw companies

752
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,248
Meeting

753
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
A different solution

754
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,088
Customized solution for industrial

755
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,624
Without having to spend

756
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
And a lot more

757
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,208
In Industry already

758
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,256
Put out Raspberry Pi's throughout

759
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:42,656
It might be limited by their capabilities this whole beef up those capabilities and be an add-on to their resistance

760
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,192
Solution which is actually rather smart

761
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,776
A lot of companies develop

762
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,616
Achieve3000

763
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,152
It helps a little bit

764
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,688
Possibly

765
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,272
Can one really interesting thing that I noticed

766
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,320
The processor

767
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:05,440
For the sin is actually an Arctic o-200 to model made by Samsung

768
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,488
How much is a sponsor

769
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:13,888
Thought it was interesting cuz he don't see Arctic mentioned in in products that often

770
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
That's true

771
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
So

772
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,336
We'll keep our eyes open

773
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
All right

774
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
Industrial Enterprise

775
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,968
Jose Enterprise

776
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
Comcast in

777
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,296
Cox cable guide

778
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
We talked about getting into

779
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
Lorawan Networks

780
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,696
And these are low power wide area Networks

781
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,768
They're usually for like

782
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
Private

783
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,608
That works for like warehouses or made

784
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
Personal

785
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,496
Works as opposed to like a cellular network

786
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
Comcast announced a bunch of

787
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,824
Science

788
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,176
For their machine to Laura when Network including my favorite

789
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,200
Example of

790
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
Connector products

791
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Which is a smart

792
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
Mouse trap

793
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,344
This is actually really cool because

794
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
I've encountered

795
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,160
Connected Pest Control

796
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:12,000
Three different use cases so basically this is something that says

797
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,048
Hey

798
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,864
In your Warehouse in the middle of nowhere. Something

799
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,312
You can do that without checking

800
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,640
Which actually is really cool

801
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:33,760
Company using Comcast Comcast

802
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,344
Whether it's about 2 years old but

803
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,392
It's getting a lot more attention

804
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
Now

805
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
Customers

806
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,464
Cox is also

807
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
They have their own

808
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
Laura

809
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,816
And they signed a deal with

810
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,888
Cox Automotive which is a giant Fleet Management

811
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
Laura as well as

812
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,032
2 track

813
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,568
Where cars are

814
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,384
So these are just too quick examples

815
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:06,784
One option

816
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
Cars with the likes of

817
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,112
AT&T and Verizon

818
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
And even

819
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
Startups we're doing

820
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,232
These guys want to provide the network

821
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,792
Work with systems integrators but

822
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,168
Yay

823
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,728
Okay let's go

824
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,520
Voicemail from riot

825
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,800

Which way you can have a brand new electronic lock installed in minutes

831
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,112
With just a screwdriver and your own two hands

832
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
Using setup

833
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,488
To see what's possible is it schlage.com

834
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,792
This week's voice mail

835
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,816

Import

837
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
Hi this is

00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:59,008
Is Claire and I'm calling from Portland Oregon to question about how I can make my smart home

839
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,544
You're awesome for my

840
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,824
6 month old baby

841
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,664
So far I have the August Smart Lock

842
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,272
I have Sonos speakers in his room but I would love any suggestion

843
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,808
Since you have on how I

844
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:17,952
Suggest

845
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,488
And what we can do

846
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,792
Thank you so much I look forward to your answer

847
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
Where are you

848
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,376
Love this question

849
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,168
Because I love

850
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
Peoples were actually thinking of

851
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,728
Cool things to do

852
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,520
Connected devices in

853
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,800
Real life scenarios so

854
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,080
Apus

855
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
Is a great singer

856
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,712
Here's some crazy idea since you're just

857
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,736
Santa visit ideas

858
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,016
Face it sounds like

859
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,552
Kevin's first idea

860
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
I think it's a good one

861
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,088
1 for where your

862
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,136
Where your kid is now at 6 months old

863
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,928
So Kevin you want to talk about the.

864
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
Yeah I would

865
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:56,096
Pinterest the only Amazon Echo device you have in your house

866
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:01,728
The reason I would do this is because you could use the Amazon app on your smartphone

867
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,032
To drop in and listen to

868
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,080
The baby boy even talk to the baby

869
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,616
And you can

870
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,664
Insane anime

871
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,944
Play

872
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:16,832
You know if you want some soothing music in there for the baby

873
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
Hands-free

874
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:24,256
However this know that even with the volume on your Echo dot turn down

875
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
When you drop in on something

876
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
You get an audible charge

877
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
And the green light

878
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,704
So if you're trying to check on your baby when

879
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,728
It's sleep

880
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
That may not be

881
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,312
Okay so what

882
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,176
I also think this is. Is a great

883
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:46,272
Take because you can play sound like what does a dog say

884
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,320
And there's a ton of skills that

885
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,600
You know kids will enjoy

886
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
Play Silly Songs

887
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,744
When the child gets a little bit older

888
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,328
Probably like 18 months to two years in your thinking about things like

889
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:02,656
Hey now that you can sleep and handle things on your own

890
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,448
Tell your toddler you want to get out of bed

891
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,496
There's a device that they sell for

892
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
Called

893
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,056
Like an alarm clock

894
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,848
Turns different colors

895
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
When

896
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,896
It hits a certain time

897
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:16,480
This is design for parents who want to get their kids to stay in the room

898
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,504
So they can sleep in

899
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:22,112
These devices are fun but you could do the same thing

900
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
You could set it so

901
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,208
At 6:30 in the morning

902
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,280
Or 6 the light bulb turns yellow

903
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,840
The light mobile stay on and stay yellow

904
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,376
Up until like 7 a.m.

905
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
At which point it will turn

906
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:42,080
Sounds Draconian if you don't believe in this sort of thing but we did it with our daughter and it was awesome

907
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:42,848
We did

908
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,384
Get a little bit more sleep that way

909
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
So we always seem like

910
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
This light is on

911
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
It better be

912
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
Emergency

913
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,112
The others since you got a son

914
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,648
When you start potty training

915
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,928
A really useful thing to do

916
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,720
Do is stick a water sensor

917
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
By your toilet

918
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,560
Yes

919
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,608
It's actually really handy

920
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,400
I would use one of these

921
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
Corded

922
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:07,936
Watersense

923
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:09,984
Rinse it off

924
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,848
As opposed to

925
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
Some of the others which

926
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,408
May not react well to

927
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,736
This sounds disgusting that all parents know

928
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,296
And

929
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:27,648
I think those are probably some good things to start with also wants you have the echo dot UK

930
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,464
Can put in things like connected doorbells and you can tell

931
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
Hey Ma

932
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,048
Turn off the chime on this doorbell

933
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,352
And then you don't have the doorbell

934
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
Bringing drinks

935
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
You can have it all

936
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,008
Tell you stories are read audiobooks to you

937
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
And baby

938
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,080
Those are all options

939
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,384
Those are all good baby things to have

940
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,456
And hopefully that gives you some fun ideas

941
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,504
OneNote on that sensor

942
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,040
You're going to need a Smart Hub

943
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,832
How'd that you work with that sensor

944
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
To my knowledge right now there are no

945
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
Dedicated sensors

946
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,696
The Amazon

947
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,768
But then you can just get the whole house or tomorrow

948
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
And then once you're doing that

949
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,912
Like you're going to want to set up motion detector outside their door so

950
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,704
Wander around in the middle of the night

951
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
You know all sorts of

952
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,824
So that is our suggestion

953
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
Remember if

954
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,920
You have an iot question for us

955
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,712
Call Santa Hotline

956
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,736
6 to 3

957
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,528
742 4

958
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,576
And I will tell you as part of my sprinkler

959
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,928
So if you call and message

960
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,256
Before March 31st I'm going to enter you to win

961
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,280
A wise

962
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,352
Camera and we'll just ship that out you have to be in North America

963
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,376
Unfortunately

964
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,168
Next month we'll do a different giveaway

965
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,520
And just to do that just leave your email as part of your

966
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,288
Voicemail

967
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,568
That sounds crazy

968
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,104
We won't run your email on there

969
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
And

970
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,199
And now

971
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,735
I feel like we've talked a lot

972
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,271
Let's move to our

973
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,319
Cast David kaiserman

974
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:05,183
And from Lennar Homes talking about what they're putting in their smart the future

975
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,975
And why they decided

976
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:13,375
To go with Matt of a as opposed to Siri

977
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:19,775
Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Samsung artik and I have John Jefferies of Samsung

978
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:23,615
Arctic here to talk about the identity of things

979
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:27,199
So remind us really quickly what it is that Samsung art

980
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,759
Samsung artik is a complete

981
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,551
Edge to Cloud platform

982
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:35,391
That delivers holistic security from the device

983
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,439
To the cloud and makes it so that

984
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,999
Device manufacturers don't have to learn

985
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,047
The Depths and intricacies of

986
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
Security

987
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
To the point

988
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,119
Secure IT solutions

989
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
Got it

990
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
So

991
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,191
Why does identity 4

992
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
Devices

993
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:52,031
Matter for the rule of identity and access management

994
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
Is expanding rapidly

995
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,103
Because it's no longer just about identifying

996
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,663
People in the New iot World Order

997
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,223
I am too. Oh must be able to identify

998
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,271
Devices sensors monitor

999
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,319
And be able to manage the access to the

1000
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,111
Data and you guys are calling this

1001
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:06,879
The identity of

1002
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
What is that

1003
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:14,303
The Diary of things is the ability to firmly and definitively identify a device on the net

1004
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,351
The identity of things matter

1005
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
For several reasons

1006
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,679
First of all you need to be able to trust

1007
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:23,263
The identity of the device to be able to trust the data that it produces

1008
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,079
Furthermore you must be able to identify the device

1009
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,871
As it's accessing your cloud

1010
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,663
And sharing data in the cloud

1011
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:34,527
You and I talked about this and you think that public key infrastructure is the best solution

1012
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
Why

1013
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,111
Public key infrastructure pki

1014
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,159
Is proven technology

1015
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:43,743
That creates and unforgeable cryptographic key

1016
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:47,327
That firmly identifies its device in the same way

1017
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
That publican

1018
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:51,679
Is universally used to identify insecure websites

1019
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:56,031
We are now using that to universally identify and secure iot devices

1020
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,591
And their data why is it the best

1021
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,639
Because it has been

1022
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:04,479
Developed and proven overtime to be uncrackable and Unbreak

1023
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,039
How does Samsung artik pull

1024
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,575
Pki and

1025
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,855
The identity of things

1026
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,183
By building Hardware backed identity of things

1027
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,999
Technology and tki management into the Arctic

1028
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:21,119
You make it easy for Enterprises to enjoy the benefits of DKI all of our devices

1029
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,191
Burned into them at Birth

1030
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,263
If you will

1031
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,799
We enable customers to

1032
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,079
Bring their own certificate

1033
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,127
An automated provisioning of them

1034
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,407
And rotate their keys

1035
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,711
As may be necessary by their screw cost

1036

Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Dave

1043
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Kaiserman

1044
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,455
Who is president of Lennar Ventures

1045
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,223
Hi David

1046
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:15,135
And I am super great I am sitting here in a linear model home and I've just been taken on a tour and seeing

1047
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,671
Holy cow

1048
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
Lutron

1049
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,719

1050
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:19,999
Philip stuff

1051
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,071
Amazon all kinds of crazy things where to find out

1052
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,119
What your future new home

1053
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
Might look like

1054
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,167
Alright David

1055
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
Talk to me about

1056
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
Why when are

1057
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,751
Is getting into the smart

1058
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,031
And they protrude

1059
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
Sure

1060
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
Soyo

1061
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,615
I think at the simplest level

1062
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,151
We build a brand new home

1063
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,687
And new really means

1064
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,479
Is best-of-breed state-of-the-art

1065
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:44,319
And so what a perfect place from a blank canvas to actually construct

1066
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
A home that

1067
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,135
Works seamlessly.

1068
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,159
Wireless

1069
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,951
It has all these devices connect

1070
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,487
Get together for manufacturers

1071
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,767
Entrust

1072
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
Into

1073
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,327
Feels like a

1074
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,351
Combat under the hood

1075
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,143
Really operates like a fine

1076
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
Sports car

1077
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:03,007
I9 Sports Car I cannot say that about my smartphone

1078
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
All right

1079
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:04,799
So

1080
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:09,663
Throughout this process you've been talking to me about experience as opposed to the technology but

1081
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,991
My listeners are super into the technology so just run down

1082
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:16,319
Some of the devices and things that you thought was important

1083
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,367
Introduce the rest of the world to the

1084
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:23,743
Trick to it starts with a wireless infrastructure and we're proud to work with a company called Ruckus Wireless

1085
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,815
A trillion RV was in the Bentley at access points

1086
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,863
In the much more Enterprise in Byram

1087
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,423
And it brought that into the residential environment

1088
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,239
And include a wireless solution with Ruckus access

1089
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,031
Appoint as a standard feature of all the homes

1090
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,871
We've also worked very closely with the Wi-Fi Alliance

1091
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,943
Which is the international standard-setting body for Wi-Fi

1092
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,711
In

1093
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,015
Cheap mapping our homes like you wouldn't office

1094
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:49,087
To ensure that we have sufficient coverage that there are no dead Spa

1095
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,135
The base of the home

1096
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,719
Is an incredible Wireless environment that allows things to interconnect

1097
00:46:54,975 --> 00:47:00,095
And then we put together best of Ray products from companies like Honeywell and their lyric thermostat

1098
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,399
Lutron and Erika Sato lighting product

1099
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
Sonos

1100
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,727
Ring video doorbell

1101
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:09,567
Kwikset and their new Kevo lock that's embedded in Baldwin

1102
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,591
Is the higher end

1103
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
Form factor

1104
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,639
Among other things

1105
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:16,991
And really put them all together such that you can control them seamlessly from button

1106
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:23,391
Better on the wall or maybe Pecos that are remotes to applications like the Samsung SmartThings application to your

1107
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,415
Your voice by using

1108
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Alexa

1109
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,463
And so for us

1110
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,303
The ability to indistinguishably work across

1111
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,583
Voice button

1112
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
And

1113
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
Applications of soup

1114
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,703
Guys he just said off Madam a

1115
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,239
That's good

1116
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,823
Actually want you to a little bit more basic like lights they're really important

1117
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,895
People so we thought we were going to prioritize connected lighting

1118
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,199
The door is important so we priority like

1119
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,015
So for people who may not have the chance

1120
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:56,159
Maybe if they're like trying to create the biggest bang for their Buck how should they think about approaching a small

1121
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,207
I think it starts with

1122
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
Great Wireless

1123
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
And I think

1124
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,535
You can't think about the way you

1125
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,839
Live your life and you mirror that so

1126
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,631
The front door super important

1127
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,655
A door lock

1128
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,191
That can be controlled both

1129
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,983
Remotely and Power

1130
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:10,751
Your voice

1131
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:14,079
A video doorbell that lets you know who's at your front door whether you're at work

1132
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,127
Or whether you're in bed

1133
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:16,895
My wife

1134
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
Love's

1135
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:21,247
Because it's technical or because it

1136
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,271
Connected

1137
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,343
She loves it because she tells me it makes her look good in her jeans

1138
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,671
When she goes out if no bulge in her pocket

1139
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
Alex Supertramp

1140
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,255
On the flip side my wife

1141
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,815
I always wonder what would happen

1142
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,119
If we needed to open the door in the middle of the night

1143
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,911
Maybe our kids were sick and

1144
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,447
We need to let somebody in

1145
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:43,519
Would we have to go downstairs and open that door but now we don't have to

1146
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:47,359
So the technology is really faded into the background

1147
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:52,991
But more importantly the stories of how it impacts in your life there's so many of them and we hear them customers

1148
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:53,759
All the time

1149
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:57,343
People have now been moving into these homes with this package

1150
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,671
With this all of your homes have this it's not even

1151
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,999
So what are the bumps that they found in then

1152
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,023
What are the

1153
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,839
Experiences that you're like oh my God I never thought of it

1154
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:11,679
So the bumps clearly have been in and around how you activate

1155
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,727
The products and how you make it work

1156
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,775
For you and one of the things we announced

1157
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,567
In June of last year with a partnership

1158
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
With Amazon

1159
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,895
Where they will come to everyone our home

1160
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:23,967
And spend hours with every one of our customers

1161
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,503
Chalk everything up

1162
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,039
Customize it for the wave

1163
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,599
Cancel service has been

1164
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,391
By far the most in

1165
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,415
Important factor

1166
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,207
People's excitement and actually

1167
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,487
10 using the product

1168
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,767
And then the products

1169
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,071
Some cells in terms of be like a door lock

1170
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,607
Echo Show in the

1171
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,935
Music the notion of how they all work together seamlessly

1172
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,703
So that

1173
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,983
One voice command

1174
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,031
Trigger a bunch of different things

1175
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,079
People have been much more interested in

1176
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,615
How do you set up a voice command

1177
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,895
How does everything how to work

1178
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
Together so

1179
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,687
We've been very

1180
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,711
Focused on

1181
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,991
Establishing

1182
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:57,759
Suggestion

1183
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:01,343
Write up voice commands like movie time or party time

1184
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,975
Or who's at the front door or lock my front door and getting people awareness around

1185
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,023
What they can do not how it works

1186
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:13,375
Does Amazon dildos or do the residents build them after they move in

1187
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
And you together

1188
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,447
So we had a list of recommendations

1189
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,239
Amazon sits down with our customers

1190
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,543
They share a starting list

1191
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:25,151
And then they sit down together and they customize for what they need so if you're a working mom you met

1192
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,943
Want to be able to give someone access

1193
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,991
List your home during certain times of the day

1194
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,295
That may be different than an active adults

1195
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,063
Cool watch

1196
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:36,159
How to get their grandkids access less frequently than a millennial

1197
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,487
Who wants to be able to let nobody in unless they bring the

1198
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Until

1199
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,047
We show them the

1200
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,863
Tools that they have and then we listen to their life

1201
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,423
And we have a real human conversation about what you need

1202
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,495
You know what we can provide and we trade a custom solution

1203
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,263
Every single

1204
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:55,359
Is this the future of Home Building the future of life

1205
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,895
And I think if you look around

1206
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,919
When's the last time

1207
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
People put a

1208
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,735
Key in their car door to open it

1209
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,503
It's just

1210
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,295
Some are expected today that

1211
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,319
Cars have

1212
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
Keyless entry

1213
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,111
I think homes

1214
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:09,695
It will be expected if they have keyless entry automated lights

1215
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:10,975
Technology

1216
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,279
And I also think that people will expect

1217
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,047
Home builders

1218
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,143
Not only focus on the mechanical systems of the home the electrical

1219
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,423
Plumbing Systems

1220
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,471
The Architects will begin to

1221
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,751
Provide Wireless

1222
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,079
Just like they do mechanical electrical and plumbing plan

1223
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,103
I'm at

1224
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,639
Homes going forward

1225
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,431
Won't use extenders in

1226
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
Peters

1227
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,247
Go use really architected

1228
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:36,063
Wireless solutions that will come down in price as they have

1229
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,111
And provide this experience where you

1230
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,135
Whatsapp

1231
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,695
Sometimes even faster inside the network

1232
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,975
In the public internet

1233
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,559
You guys did with the Wi-Fi

1234
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,863
You guys did the Wi-Fi certified home Stan

1235
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,679
Clearly this is the Bedrock

1236
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:55,519
For your home but why choose Wi-Fi

1237
00:51:55,775 --> 00:52:00,127
Over maybe some of the other standards that are familiar in the smart home and does that preclude using

1238
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:04,735
Sacre question it doesn't preclude it at all in fact Lutron use as an internal

1239
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,527
Proprietary Network clear connect

1240
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,575
But the ability to access

1241
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,135
Those devices from outside of the home

1242
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,439
Is dependent on Wi-Fi so there are

1243
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,463
Many different

1244
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,999
Marriage is a different

1245
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:16,767
Standards

1246
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
I think

1247
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,351
We pick WiFi for two reasons

1248
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,887
One it's brand

1249
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,703
And it clearly the world over is recognized

1250
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,983
Half of the internet traffic

1251
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,775
We know today is over Wi-Fi

1252
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,567
And I think the second reason to is

1253
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,335
We seen

1254
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,359
Most manufacturer

1255
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,151
Most manufacturer

1256
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,735
Adopt some form of Wi-Fi integration whether it's

1257
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,807
Remotely controlling it from the outside or even internally

1258
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,135
The network include things like BL

1259
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,439
Wicker front door lock Odyssey uses

1260
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,463
Or clear connector

1261
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,999
Tricare standard light

1262
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,023
Lutron system

1263
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
We think the unifying

1264
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,119
Thread throughout all of those is Wi-Fi

1265
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,167
And then on top of that layers different standard

1266
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:00,031
This was a hugely controversial move for you guys I remember reading in

1267
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,615
Ice Pro oh my God

1268
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,407
Do you get better everything over wires

1269
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,175
So

1270
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:12,831
Practice how has that played out and then also how you convinced you know the CD of community and other people who are

1271
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
Hardwired

1272
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:18,719
I think a couple things one is we have not thrown out the wires in the

1273
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,511
I know that's been reported but

1274
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,303
That's not true we have

1275
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,863
Continue to provide a balance

1276
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,399
Amount of structured wiring

1277
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,447
With a much more robust Wireless in my

1278
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:32,287
And from a consumer perspective which I think ultimately defines

1279
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,079
Many people's perspectives

1280
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,127
When's the last time you took your laptop in

1281
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:36,895
And plugged it into

1282
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,455
I do it every week but I record a show

1283
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,735
So so

1284
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,759
Ever the app

1285
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:44,319
Everyone else mini-computers don't even have any

1286
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,855
My computer doesn't have an Ethernet

1287
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:46,879
That's right

1288
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:50,207
I think we're finding that it's not one or the other

1289
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:53,279
But it's a healthy marriage about that we still have cable Jackson

1290
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,863
Coax in our rooms were pulling out things where we're going

1291
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,167
Super extreme environment

1292
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,471
Work cry and Ice balance but we do now

1293
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,799
Is that people come think of their home at the place that they make their memory

1294
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,871
Whether family grows up where they have parties where they do things

1295
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:14,527
I'll be in their minds forever and the technology that they have around them if it different in the home then it isn't

1296
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,063
Every other aspect of their life

1297
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,343
Brings the home down

1298
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,903
And what we want to do is kind of bring the home back up to

1299
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
Speed

1300
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:24,767
Your car is super technology-enabled it still drives like a car

1301
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,047
Just like the office

1302
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,839
Is super technological

1303
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:31,935
Still your office your home is just kind of falling behind it so you look at

1304
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:35,263
Companies like apple and Amazon and Google and Samsung

1305
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,823
They're all making huge bets on home

1306
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,847
Because it's that

1307
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,383
Can a gaping hole

1308
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,663
In the world where

1309
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,711
Life is different inside your home that it is

1310
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,735
Almost every

1311
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,039
Let's talk about Security in

1312
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:47,807
Privacy

1313
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,367
Because you guys set this up and

1314
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,391
Do you manage it

1315
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,183
So we allow eats

1316
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:55,743
Persons Network to be managed by themselves

1317
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,279
Provide them access

1318
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,863
Simply to Amazon if you have any questions for adjustments or

1319
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,935
We actually provide a 90-day happiness guarantee that

1320
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,959
If I need tweaks

1321
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,519
The first 90 days Amazon will continue to come out in

1322
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,543
Do that for them

1323
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,823
But their home is their home

1324
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,639
We're not managing it we're not listening in on it

1325
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,991
But we're not a technology company and we partnered with people

1326
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:20,831
We take these matters really really seriously and we place a lot of stock

1327
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,391
In their level of Neo scrutiny

1328
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:28,255
Security but what we do is build we have a canvas

1329
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,047
From which people can actually

1330
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,607
Bring all these pieces together now it's more than just

1331
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,887
People who live in our home

1332
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:34,911
Turn many people

1333
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,703
Come by our model home centers

1334
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,239
Want to

1335
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:43,871
Decorating ideas we have a bit of floor plan ideas we have maybe the home automation

1336
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:48,991
We're starting to see that the influence is not just directly to people that are buying home

1337
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,015
The people are

1338
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:50,783
Curious

1339
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,831
About how all these things work together

1340
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,391
Until you go to Best Buy it's very very hard

1341
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,695
Understand how the whole system works together

1342
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:01,023
You sit in the couch down our living room you say movie time

1343
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,559
And all the subsystem

1344
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,351
Scarifier at once

1345
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:07,423
And you get that experience and people are beginning to see that

1346
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,239
You know it's about the sum of the parts and not the end of it

1347
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,519
Okay

1348
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,079
And what about Security in terms of

1349
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,615
He put all the stuff in here

1350
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,895
Let's say

1351
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,687
My Lutron lights get hacked

1352
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,711
So far not

1353
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,735
However

1354
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,271
Let's say there's a vulnerability that

1355
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,039
Discovered

1356
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,855
How do you ensure that Lutron does this so people

1357
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,415
Where's the responsibility first off

1358
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,439
And what are you doing

1359
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,231
In the beginning

1360
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:36,351
And I think we've been very careful to pick people that have demonstrated to us

1361
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:39,935
Significant resources behind not only security

1362
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,471
Customer service

1363
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,007
Liability in everything

1364
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:48,383
And instead of having 30 different manufacturers in this home

1365
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,687
What heater 9 but will have very

1366
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,711
Deep levels of

1367
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:54,783
Conversations in relationships all the way to the senior levels

1368
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,063
To make sure

1369
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,111
That what they put in our homes

1370
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,439
You not only works but it's supported and they're aligned

1371
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,719
Towards that with us

1372
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,999
Because as they

1373
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,279
Look to sell their products

1374
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,583
And they look at the deficiencies of retail

1375
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,143
When I say reach I mean that aisle at Best Buy

1376
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,167
Retail

1377
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,751
They want to be able to tell a story about how their product works

1378
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,031
As much as anybody

1379
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:19,103
Lennar has more model homes in Target actually has stores

1380
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,663
Until the notion of being able to

1381
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,199
Having to get it right

1382
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:23,967
Is

1383
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
Bo tables

1384
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,831
And supporting it when things go wrong and they will go wrong

1385
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,367
Play Everything Is Not Perfect

1386
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,415
Having the infrastructure in place

1387
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,951
Really defines the universal

1388
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:39,839
Okay and then what kind of things do you suggest to your users when they

1389
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,375
Common in terms of setting up

1390
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:44,447
Like the commissioning and let's talk about the decommissioning of a

1391
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,239
How does that process take

1392
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,287
Who just started this sub

1393
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,567
Decommissioning

1394
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,103
Isn't something different

1395
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:51,871
Experience

1396
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,919
How to take the commissioning of the home

1397
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,711
It's something that we actually wanted

1398
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,735
Take away

1399
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,271
From the

1400
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,831
Perspective of the consumer and do for them

1401
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,647
And we want to do it for them in a branded way so

1402
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:06,975
Amazon has just launched its new experts business which is

1403
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:09,023
Amazon employees that come in

1404
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,327
To help both activate devices that we

1405
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,351
Include with our home

1406
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,887
And sell you more devices

1407
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,423
That you want to add on to your home

1408
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,983
They are super trained

1409
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,311
In not only how each device works but how they

1410
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,335
Can grow

1411
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:26,431
And we believe that a white glove approach is absolutely essential

1412
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:29,503
At least now even though these are DIY products

1413
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,039
They can get very complicated

1414
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:34,111
And so in order for them to work reliably

1415
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,671
Together and for the experience really to shine through

1416
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,719
We think has to be done in all white clubwear

1417
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,999
Okay

1418
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,791
Tell me you do have a plan for Deke

1419
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,095
Surely you may not have done it

1420
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:47,167
Like what I move out what happens when I move out of your smart

1421
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:47,935
So

1422
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,215
Our plan is

1423
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,519
Probably the same which is Amazon or

1424
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:56,127
Some bread Partnership of people that have dedicated experts available to you

1425
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
To do so

1426
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,943
Intercourse can people live in their homes for

1427
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,223
789 years

1428
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,503
Things are going to change

1429
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,295
They're going to be new technologies

1430
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:06,367
Our homes today don't include things like Wireless blood pressure

1431
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:09,951
I put the code in the future or maybe Wireless medical devices

1432
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,999
There are going to be things that are going to be

1433
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,279
Added change

1434
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,815
Take it away from the system

1435
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:18,143
And again our belief is that with those changes comes

1436
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,679
Sphere and uncertainty

1437
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:23,007
Doubt that should be best delayed by

1438
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:23,775
Sardis

1439
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,055
White Glove service

1440
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,079
Branzino

1441
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:31,199
So in this model because I mean a granite countertop for example is going to last

1442
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,479
Gosh probably forever

1443
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:38,111
I might eventually I might get tired of it and I'll renovate my kitchen but

1444
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:41,951
There is no equivalent yet for renovating your smartphone

1445
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,743
Pulling out your old Gear in

1446
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,023
Adding new gear

1447
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,583
So it's just it's an interesting thought

1448
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,911
I spend a lot of time with his I've got devices my home for like 5 years

1449
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,679
Json like

1450
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:55,775
These are predictions are not sure that would rather be right or wrong

1451
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,823
But I believe the world is a wireless

1452
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,639
And that in order for us to

1453
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,663
Change

1454
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,687
Sayings

1455
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,967
Bike locks and lights

1456
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:05,759
Is the fable

1457
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:10,367
You have to think whether it would be a wired world or a wireless World in respect of those

1458
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,415
If you believe it's a wireless

1459
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,439
Which is the premise

1460
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
We're starting from

1461
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:16,511
Then you look at the Box

1462
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:19,071
That's on the ceiling that's a Wi-Fi box

1463
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,095
The Rock

1464
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,143
And you say what what about

1465
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,935
What is the radio frequency

1466
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,983
What if the

1467
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:26,751
Software

1468
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:30,335
There's a combination of hardware and over the air updates

1469
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,871
Can be put together

1470
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,151
That will change

1471
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,687
Wireless signals that made

1472
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,759
But it won't change the nature of what you

1473
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,039
Which is Wireless

1474
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
And it's all

1475
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,135
And then you also think about things like the control center

1476
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,927
Are the panels where we put all the

1477
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,231
Relevant pieces of Technology like the hubs

1478
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,767
And we think about things like

1479
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,791
Should I be metal

1480
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,839
Historically does a Bento Box

1481
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,887
Metal and wireless don't, go together

1482
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,911
We have a plastic one

1483
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,471
Do you have enough room inside of

1484
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:01,311
Do you have enough structured wiring run to other places in the home edit

1485
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:05,151
If you had to attach some sort of wireless device to the network

1486
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,199
Those are all things

1487
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:07,967
We think about

1488
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,015
And while there's no Assurance of a

1489
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:10,783
Will be perfect

1490
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,807
Going down

1491
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:12,831
Future

1492
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,367
We got as much as we can

1493
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,135
Future-proof

1494
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,695
Right to accommodation Not Just Wireless

1495
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,487
Wireless infrastructure

1496
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,255
To the end devices

1497
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,535
Wired into

1498
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,303
Structure

1499
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,583
To various

1500
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,119
Awesome

1501
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:29,471
And if I am a company and I really like this idea and want to work with you

1502
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,263
How does that happen how do you pick your part

1503
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,055
So the first thing we've done is we've

1504
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,335
Partners

1505
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,103
Have

1506
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,919
The depth of resources to support their cause

1507
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,479
Security customer care

1508
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,015
Replacements manufacturer

1509
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:44,575
That really limits the world

1510
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
People that we have work

1511
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,647
Because there's so many cool interesting

1512
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,183
Technologies out there

1513
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:49,951
But

1514
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,023
They don't have the maturity of the industrial manufacturer

1515
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,583
And so for us in order to have

1516
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:01,471
Some reliability in this market today restricted ourselves to those industrial manufacturers

1517
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,519
All those resources in place

1518
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:08,895
I'm at overtime as people want to bring in their own Technologies that's where Amazon comes

1519
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,431
Seldom different things

1520
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:14,015
So will give you the base but sort of the infrastructure that we think is

1521
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,551
Solid and reliable

1522
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:18,111
You got to change it as you want

1523
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,951
To be clear I could buy it from someplace other than Amazon and bring it in

1524
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,279
Okay and final question for you because

1525
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:29,375
Many many many months ago you guys were working with apple and homekit

1526
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,911
When are we going to be at home kit come

1527
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,679
And then

1528
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,727
Les Paul

1529
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,007
No I guess it was June

1530
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,031
You said

1531
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:36,799
Amazon

1532
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,847
Madam is the way to go

1533
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:42,687
So we have a lot of regard for apple and their engineering Carlos and we've been

1534
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,967
The products of a plethora

1535
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:47,807
Our decision in moving forward with Amazon was really based on things that app

1536
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,599
A service work

1537
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:53,695
The ability to retail additional products of real size

1538
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,487
Greater scope

1539
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,047
The ability to work cross

1540
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,351
Multiple different devices

1541
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,911
And still work together with like a Samsung

1542
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:07,007
Right kind of together the strategy of matinee as you call her

1543
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:11,103
Be incorporated into Sonos speakers and incorporate into other devices

1544
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,663
We looked at those principles and he said

1545
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:18,015
As we try to sell a different way of living of reimagine way of living

1546
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,831
The degree of flexibility that allowed for

1547
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,111
Alegria service

1548
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,903
That's being provided for

1549
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:24,927
Was very different

1550
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,207
Apple was

1551
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:30,303
There's nothing in our homes that couldn't be hooked up the home

1552
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,583
Many of the devices we have

1553
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,351
Happy happiness

1554
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:33,887
Compatible

1555
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,215
But we believe you have to sell a single way of living

1556
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,495
A single brand

1557
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,263
Partnership

1558
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,543
And one that's

1559
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,079
Able to kind of stand

1560
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
Service all the way

1561
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
Pair device

1562
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:47,199
