From Cars

14
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:49,152
And we're going to talk about how Congress just sold out your privacy

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,992
When it comes to isps and what that means for iot

00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,320

And now

21
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,096
Let's take a moment for a message

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,680
From our sponsor hey this week sponsors

00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,008

So I just want to tell you guys if you care so much about the internet of things that you listen to the show check out my newsletter

25
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,808
It's at ww.w. Stacey on iot. Calm and it's actually the stuff we don't talk about it

26
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
Osso whole new perspective on the Internet of Things the other thing I should say is if you're interested in advertising

27
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,608
You should email Andrew at Coyote podcast.com and that's why

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
Are ready Kevin

29
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
After that inspiring ad

30
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
Let's talk about

31
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,360
Yeah I did not realize

32
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
Shame on me but you knew about that several months ago but it's now public information that's new Prada

33
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Alex from Ikea

34
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,320
Connected

35
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
Bulbs and sensors

36
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
On the cheats really

37
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
Yeah

38
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
So this is the

39
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464
Prodigy

40
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:10,304
Yes I actually pulled this as an FCC filing back in December

41
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
If you got my newsletter

42
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
Hartsell right there

43
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
All right

44
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,008
This is a zigbee

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
And Wi-Fi

46
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
Wireless lighting kit

47
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Basically

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,664
That Ikea sewing for is $85

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,064
It works out to about $85 however you can't get it unless you're in Sweden right now so it's actual prices

50
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
Swedish krona

51
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
749 4

52
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
Gateway remote controlling two bulbs

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
Which is

54
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,256
Addison DeLand

55
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,816
I'm hoping this will come to the US

56
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,656
Because they did file actually with the FCC which it does indicate that

57
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,216
They want to come to the US because otherwise why would you go

58
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
Go to that effort

59
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,056
And this is kind of his part of Ikea's actually

60
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:58,688
Been creeping into kind of technology for a long time now they've they have wireless charging on Summer

61
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Moser furniture

62
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,880
Which I was just concerned they have 14 different wireless charging options some built into their furniture and some you can

63
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,720
Module and apply to room furniture which is kind of interesting

64
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
Actually I didn't realize I had

65
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,912
Yeah it's it's 30 bucks and for those who keep up with a standard Caesar all the chi

66
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,472
Wireless charging standard is what's used

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
Which is

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,336
Pretty much the winner right now

69
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
That's the one people

70
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Apple's going to use

71
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,064
What Apple actually does I believe use it for the Apple watch so that that's if that's any indication

72
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Yes

73
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
But who knows

74
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
We are not saying that that's how

75
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
We're just saying

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,584
Really cool video a while back

77
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,656
If you search for Ikea and smart kitchen video I bet you'll see it

78
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
They basically showcased

79
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
Sensors in

80
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
A projection

81
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,896
Tiny Pico projector that projects images down on a counter

82
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
It was a really neat like

83
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,504
It's not real it's something they may never do but it was

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,088
Clear that Ikea is thinking about how to bring kind of

85
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
Intelligence into the home

86
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
And I feel like this could be like a great

87
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
Gateway

88
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
For mainstream

89
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,815
I just mainstream America and mainstream Sweden

90
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,167
Well I mean I can get such a global presence

91
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,727
So they got a huge advantage of a lot of these

92
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:31,615
A smart home product companies that don't have their own storefronts right there just a single or two or three products and

93
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
You purchase eyeliner

94
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Amazon

95
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:39,807
You walk into an Ikea store and you you live in the rooms that they sell essentially right that the showroom

96
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,671
The make it walk to the show I mean there's little hidden shortcuts turn off

97
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
You actually care

98
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
Yes yes

99
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:54,655
And I think that really goes all huge Way Forward for people to understand why these products can be beneficial

100
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,471
When you can just walk into a room and Ikea

101
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,079
And put your phone down all the sudden your phone say it's charging and you say oh well that's kind of cool

102
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,895
And then there's a little Maybe edematous

103
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,455
Turn off or whatever it may be

104
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,551
And when people it can experience it and it's not that expensive to add

105
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111
That's huge for I cannot have a huge advantage

106
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
Maybe they should

107
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
Call up Amazon in

108
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
And get mad amazed voice services

109
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
That would be really cool

110
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
That would be cool

111
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
Picture frame with that

112
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
Let's do it

113
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,519
That's a very exciting

114
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Also in Europe

115
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,359
And here's actually something I was thinking about with a key

116
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,919
There's a story about milk which is a

117
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,479
High-end Home Appliance come

118
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,551
Having a hat dishwasher

119
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,879
The challenge here is

120
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,951
It's actually the big point I took away from the mule story

121
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,767
Wasn't the vulnerability because that happens

122
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,911
Was this the statement that because meal is an appliance company and not appear play it come

123
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,471
It doesn't have a process for reporting

124
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Are fixing bugs

125
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,823
So the people who actually did the research and noticed it

126
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,871
They sent an email but meal never respond

127
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:14,271
In this is something that I'm hoping that Ikea's thinking about it really anybody who's doing this

128
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Is

129
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,831
These products you can't just

130
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,927
Create ship out to the world you have to think about security

131
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,583
And you have to think about an ongoing relationship with the customer because that's really what this does this creates an ongoing

132
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
Relationship

133
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
Between you and your

134
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
And

135
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,519
It's got to be a two-way street which means you can't just suck data from their dishwasher

136
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
You have to

137
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
In return

138
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
Give them value

139
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Which

140
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
Probably includes not having

141
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,343
I agree with you it's really an extension of the existing support business model you if you're in a support your product or supporting everything about

142
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,743
You can't just selectively say well if the nozzle inside the sprayer

143
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,327
What year did the song

144
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
You can't have it both ways

145
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,191
Exactly and I should say that this is a professional

146
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Dishwasher

147
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
Commercial level

148
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,591
These are sold into you know Church's kitchen

149
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,383
These kind of places

150
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,711
And the vendors response so far is

151
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Take it offline

152
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,551
Or firewall at offer

153
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
Nothing else

154
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
Which

155
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
I'm sorry

156
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
The shaft for the penetrator

157
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Restaurant

158
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,375
Hey can you open up a socket I need to clean some dishes

159
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Yeah

160
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
Going to happen so

161
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
That's the lesson I took away for

162
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
This

163
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
Hopefully that

164
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Ikea

165
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
Pay attention to this

166
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Do this

167
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
All right

168
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,919
So other big news

00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
The maker of

186
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
Suvee cooker

187
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,327
Of those Brands probably the biggest for most of our audience is going to be

188
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
Wink lifx rachio

189
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
August

190
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
Sa August

191
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
I don't think it did but it's in there

192
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,799
It's also a sew in

193
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,847
Was it let's let's kind of work this out

194
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
So to connect stuff

195
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,943
What you're going to do is you would go into your Google home

196
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
App

197
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
You go into the menu

198
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Connect

199
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
2

200
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Be smart

201
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
Earth smart home settings

202
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,695
And you basically see a little plus sign you hit that plus sign

203
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
And you're going to get the list you

204
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,047
Click on the item you want to add and then

205
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
Your ticket to an authentication screen

206
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,191
Right that's how you link the IRT accounts to Google home

207
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:18,079
We should know what this also comes to Google assistance not specific to Google home so if you have assistant on your

208
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
On which

209
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,687
Shaw Android 6 & 7 devices now

210
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,735
It's very similar to the process

211
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
So this is really

212
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Interesting

213
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,087
And

214
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:34,975
With August I have to tell you guys if you're like yes I can see if my doors are locked you cannot

215
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
Unlock your doors from

216
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
Google home

217
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
You also will need

218
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
A August connect

219
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,679
Which is basically a bridge to give your August access

220
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,751
Wi-Fi

221
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Yeah

222
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:53,919
Now August is working with companies to get if you have bluetooth support on your router

223
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
One day

224
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,271
You should be able to control your August

225
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
Build your router

226
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
If there's bluetooth support

227
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,695
That actually reminds me that Google added support

228
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,767
For certain Smart Home Products months ago

229
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
Through the Google Wi-Fi

230
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
Devices

231
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
Which do I Bluetooth so I wonder

232
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
We can check

233
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
We'll check on that will come back to that

234
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Like next

235
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
Okay

236
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
So that's exciting

237
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
Frigidaire stuff

238
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
Pest Control

239
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,319
Conditioning the other thing is actually the tp-link

240
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,903
Outlets are the other thing that's kind of exciting

241
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
ESPYs are

242
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
We're going to get into something

243
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
This may seem

244
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
Virtual pet

245
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,351
I think the best bang for your buck

246
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
After you get

247
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
Any digital assistant

248
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
The echo

249
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
Even Siri

250
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:55,359
Oracle home is to buy an outfit if you want to test smart home stuff

251
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,919
Because this is like a $40 invest

252
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
You're doing Siri you're going to have to do a

253
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Idevices

254
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
But if you're doing

255
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,623
The Echo and Google home you can actually switch between a WeMo

256
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,183
Or the tp-link outlet since both

257
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Supported

258
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
End

259
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:17,375
You just pop those in I think it's great to have it is your bedside table lamp just plug your bedside table and then been to it

260
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
Name it something

261
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,215
Ghetto nice and when you go to bed at night

262
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
You can tell your

263
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
Smart home device

264
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
Provided it's in your bedroom

265
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,871
Hey so-and-so turn off the light

266
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,431
Book that's so nice

267
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
And I feel like is everyone

268
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,783
For 40 bucks it gives you a sense of Mike

269
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:43,231
So I don't think that's controversial at all cuz I actually agree with you 100% And the reason being you can take that switch

270
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,559
Weather whether it's a WeMo switch on tp-link whatever or not device

271
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,887
And you can move it around your house and test different thing

272
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,983
It's not a single thing you can take you can use it to control anything that you plug in essentially

273
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,311
So you can start getting a feel for what you might want to automate

274
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
Add insulin to a Smart Home

275
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
For very little

276
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
So I agree in fact

277
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,991
My WeMo switches is literally my

278
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,807
Night table next to my bed just as you would setting

279
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,623
I told the echo at night you know shut the light so

280
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
Jewelry

281
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
So

282
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
Here's here's where things get a little

283
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
I don't think is it controversial

284
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
How scandalous

285
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
But here's

286
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
Here's the

287
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
WeMo security

288
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
Always makes me feel a little

289
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
Little iffy

290
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,783
And they're very active when they discover bugs but

291
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
They discovered bugs a lot

292
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
Nemo products

293
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
And their software has gotten so much better

294
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
There's a lot of people out there who

295
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Who hate women

296
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
There's a lot of people are like God sucks

297
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
I think it's much better

298
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
I actually

299
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
I like my WeMo switch I think

300
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
It works well

301
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,727
But I am very careful about firmware updates because

302
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,287
Because they have such a big footprint

303
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
There's a lot of attacks

304
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
People of hacking their WeMo switches

305
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
The other thing is

306
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,039
The tp-link switch is I guess I'm concerned about the security there because tp-link

307
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,343
Has got so many products

308
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
+ 4

309
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
Some of their routers have been

310
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
Implicated in some of the heart

311
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
Put a password

312
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Hacks

313
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
I just

314
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,095
I don't have a lot of questions about 1

315
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
How do they feel about security

316
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Into

317
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,215
They have a huge portfolio products

318
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
To maintain and I worry that

319
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
Smart home Outlets are probably not make

320
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
No soy routers and such more

321
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
Winter nails

322
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,223
So that's what feels kind of controversial

323
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
Did you talk a lot about security

324
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,831
So if you are really panicked about security

325
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
Maybe this isn't

326
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
The device for you

327
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,487
Unless unless you have a

328
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,303
IOS device and you get an idevice switch

329
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
Because I'm your car

330
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
The homekit security built in

331
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Right.

332
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,775
Haymeadow mess

333
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
Turn off my bedside table

334
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
Alright so that was our digression away from

335
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,431
Google home let's go back to it and ask

336
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
Heaven

337
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
This is change your mind about

338
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,807
I knew you were going to ask that

339
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,647
It's funny because people at work I was at Google New York City yesterday and

340
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,463
Hi I've known about the news like a day in advance so

341
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,815
We were talking about it internally And Then There Was X going to get a Google home right I'm like

342
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
The thing is

343
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:32,447
I don't think so I mean I've already invested in for echoes

344
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
So

345
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Really

346
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
What am I gaining

347
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
But I can't already do

348
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:42,687
That was the big thing I stuck with the echo because it had wink support and it might

349
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,735
Smart home hub is built around wink

350
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,551
I mean I'm having real good wink support is now on Google home

351
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
But again

352
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
I think you're gaining

353
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
A much

354
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
More

355
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Intelligent

356
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Assistant

357
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,351
Better search results if you use your Echo

358
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,423
If you want to use your device that way

359
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
I find the Google home to be much better

360
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
I've heard they're very similar

361
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
Sentiments from many many people

362
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
And I think

363
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,639
For the audience the dead search histories things

364
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,711
Yes I would agree with you I'm not one of those people

365
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
So you could be because it's

366
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
Really

367
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Very useful

368
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
I think so here's my thought

369
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
Because you have the

370
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,743
You could always add a Google home to your setup and it's not like

371
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
It has to change anything

372
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,607
No no it's just do I need a v

373
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,423
Voice interface in my house right now when really

374
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
I have Google assistant on my phone

375
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Which

376
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
Takes the place of

377
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
A Google home

378
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,383
For these purposes

379
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
Twist

380
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967
Google assistant on your phone

381
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Okay

382
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Then you're fine

383
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,575
I just don't have it I can

384
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
Okay

385
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,671
You carry your phone around with you so it totally Miss

386
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
All right

387
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,023
I'm going to say for anyone who's on the fence who's like

388
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Echo or Google

389
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
This actually

390
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
Unless you have

391
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
An unsupported device in

392
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,983
I'm going to tell you right now there is a big handsome

393
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,543
Put a device right now that I know is coming soon

394
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
We'll talk about it next week

395
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
Intrigue

396
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
But

397
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
I think

398
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
You could go either way

399
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
And I would probably

400
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
AdWords Google home

401
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
At this point

402
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
Because the

403
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
The ability to talk to it

404
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
Is so much

405
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:36,351
Better and semantics for like things like turning on your lights is actually

406
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
More user-friendly

407
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
Cuz when I tell my Google home

408
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,007
I can basically tell it to turn on living room lights I can tell it to turn limit

409
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
Lights on

410
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,871
I don't have to have a specific phrase where the echo is very

411
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
Ulta points

412
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,343
Call FairPoint I'm a little surprised that you personally because I know that you like your Sonos

413
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
They've announced

414
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
Echo integration

415
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
You're back in November

416
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,791
And I have not heard any integration plans with Google home

417
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Well dang it

418
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
You just made me think

419
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,887
Boom

420
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
That's true

421
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
Will have to

422
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
Keep listing or keep

423
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
Okay I'm keeping the app

424
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,687
Okay

425
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
A lot of factors here

426
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807
Alright so

427
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,855
It's okay it wasn't like I was going to sell my

428
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
Sonic

429
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,743
I am going to switch my Google home

430
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
And my echo

431
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
So my echo right now

432
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
The kitchen

433
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,143
Main living area of my house

434
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Google home

435
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
My bathroom

436
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
Swap those out

437
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
And live with it for a

438
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
There you go

439
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
All right so that's Google home

440
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
Let's talk about

441
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,271
Let's talk about the other big story of this week

442
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Texas

443
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
Consumer broadband

444
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
I have a seal

445
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Laws

446
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
I cannot believe you did this

447
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
So

448
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
I totally can

449
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,679
So what happened is Congress passed a law the president has not yet signed

450
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Congress

451
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
But you probably will

452
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Revoking

453
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,359
Obama era regulations about governing your

454
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
Internet privacy

455
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
So

456
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,967
Basically Tom wheeler FCC

457
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Couple years

458
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Was it last year

459
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
2 years ago

460
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,367
Basically said that isps could not look at your broadband data and

461
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
And then use it for Mark

462
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Purposes

463
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
And sell it

464
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
To third parties

465
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023
In this data includes

466
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,839
Places you go on the web so your url history

467
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
That's all tied to actual

468
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,655
Information about

469
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,495
I think even the apps that you use on devices I think

470
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,799
Yes actually even the apps that

471
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,591
Devices

472
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,871
What this means

473
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,663
For all of us were like

474
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:04,575
Cow the first thing it means to me and I already did it just last night and plumbing I should have been a long time ago as I install a VPN

475
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,135
Participe and service and install on my mobile devices

476
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,255
I went with OP Rochester a couple last night

477
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,583
And I ended up going with surfeasy VPN

478
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,655
Which I believe is part of operas

479
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
Sweet of

480
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,263
Products I'm going to double-check that's why I'm not getting bad information there

481
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
Design and development

482
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,615
Canada

483
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
Which I think is $50 a year from

484
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
The five devices unlimited data

485
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
They have

486
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,087
Smaller plans one device unlimited data

487
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
And so on

488
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,415
But I've got a tunnel to

489
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,975
Use my ISP and they cannot see

490
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
What I'm actually doing

491
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,559
Got it and I

492
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
Have

493
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Viper V

494
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
Vyp

495
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
DIY videos

496
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,959
The last night

497
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
Vyp

498
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,127
Eat in this day and age we ignore valves yes I remember now

499
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
Hawaii

500
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,527
That's the one I use that's also available

501
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
4

502
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
Everything

503
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Including

504
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Your router

505
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,999
Is it frustrating

506
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
It can be done

507
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,327
And we're going to

508
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
So

509
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
When we saw this news

510
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,215
We wondered what does this mean for your iot devices

511
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
Kevin asks a really good question

512
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
Inside Out 2

513
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
Emails to people

514
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,127
If this happens what does it mean

515
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,407
Can what can

516
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
Myspc

517
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,015
Yeah cuz I mean a lot of people frame the whole

518
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:43,903
Issue as well it's it's my browsing information out there getting and songs over to put my question and

519
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,951
Sasa never talked about this before the show

520
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,255
Just kind of tree has to come a little bit right now

521
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
Does that also mean

522
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Include

523
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,447
Data from my iot devices and a good example at Stacy

524
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:01,055
Can an ISP determine if your home or away because they can now see that information

525
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:06,687
Or can they see your your thermostat settings at any point in time or have a history of that

526
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,783
In which case if they do when we don't know the answer this question yet but

527
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
Wings worth asking

528
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,855
Let's assume that they do for a second

529
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,440
Could they then sell that information to an HVAC

530
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,232
Provider that says hey

531
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:24,096
But these guys on your list to hit up for new energy efficient system

532
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
Based on the use of our devices

533
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
Pets

534
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,448
Obviously not what we want so

535
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,544
I need a lot of questions here

536
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
But I think they need to

537
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
So

538
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,384
We came up with

539
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,968
It is certainly possible for them to know what devices are on your

540
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
So that is

541
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
That is

542
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,344
Unless you're running a VPN at your router

543
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
They will be able to see like a

544
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,440
There's traffic coming out of her house coming

545
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
Email from Nest from

546
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,024
Wink from all of these other places

547
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
Stowaway2

548
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
Ensure that that

549
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:00,192
Data isn't more exposed is look for products that have end end

550
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Encryption

551
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
To the cloud

552
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
And

553
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,640
That's a hard thing so cuz I when I when I talked to come

554
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
Companies about their staff

555
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,200
Security products a lot of them will say

556
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Hey

557
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
We have

558
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
Encryption

559
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,856
More information please.

560
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,160
Caption in a lot of them encrypt your data

561
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,720
A good product should encrypt your data

562
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
To the cloud

563
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,072
For example lifx got in a lot of trouble several years ago

564
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
Because they actually

565
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:32,448
They were sending your Wi-Fi passwords in ssids and

566
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
In plain text

567
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
But

568
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,616
People notice that in real life x what are you doing in life exercise

569
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
My bad

570
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
So

571
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,784
These sorts of things are getting fixed all the time but I would say to anyone making a product

572
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,344
Hello cloud-to-cloud encryption

573
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
You should probably start talking

574
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
About that

575
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
And consumers

576
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
You should probably look for that if

577
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488
If you don't want to do

578
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
This kind of information going

579
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
To your ISP

580
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
Correct correct

581
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
Cheer is

582
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
To sell you things it's always

583
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
Oh that's true

584
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,312
What can I say and what can I do with it is better the two questions so I completely agree

585
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,128
I'm going to go a little tan gentle hair just for one second

586
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
I'm just going to say that I will never

587
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
Put a VPN on my router

588
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,784
Amazon Echo

589
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,344
That is one potential

590
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,136
Think about that

591
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,416
Sorry

592
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,720
Because it may not geographically in

593
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
You're from so it's going to

594
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
Boom

595
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
My main thought was

596
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
Very related

597
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,144
I get all my television content

598
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,752
Through the internet through PlayStation do and as soon as I put my VPN on my mobile devices

599
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,056
Even though it's on my network

600
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,640
The service will not work it's like I don't know where you are I don't know if you're allowed to watch this

601
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
Space TV shows

602
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,736
You're not

603
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
So

604
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,344
That is a a bit of a hassle like soap

605
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,392
I put the VPN on my devices

606
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,672
Not on my router

607
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
And I

608
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,536
Using Android TV Nvidia Shield TV.

609
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,864
Can I install a VPN software on that because then I couldn't watch TV

610
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,960
Oh so this seems like a really great opportunity for vpnmakers

611
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
2

612
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
Allow you to

613
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
I don't know

614
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,080
I guess it wouldn't be

615
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,384
But maybe authenticate your real address

616
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:26,112
No no that they don't want to provide that information I mean you know I'm 10 spoof locations people do spool okay

617
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,696
Patience to get like overseas content viewable here for example

618
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:35,584
It's going to be messy as more people cut the cord if they're going to use vpns as well so

619
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,888
I'm not sure how that's all going to be handling

620
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,240
But that's my reason for no VPN on the router although I would prefer the VPN on the router I will be honest

621
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
Yeah cuz you can't put a VPN on

622
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
On your nest

623
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,336
Or maybe you can I don't know

624
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,616
Guys twerking

625
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
That's that news

626
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,224
Let's talk about Bluetooth world

627
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,272
Because it's where I'm at

628
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,576
So I'm in Santa Clara right now and

629
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,672
I came to this thinking that I was going to learn all about Bluetooth mesh

630
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,464
Because that's my latest obsession

631
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,256
Put in 5SOS

632
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,816
And sadly we are going to still be waiting

633
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
Forbush

634
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
And that is

635
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,704
It's not not happening this year

636
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,728
But it didn't happen

637
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
Connect Bluetooth

638
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,360
And Magic is not a Bluetooth world

639
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
It sounds like it'll be

640
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
A couple of months

641
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,968
And the other thing that I heard

642
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,016
Is there are

643
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,064
Go in addition to mash

644
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,112
The next big effort from

645
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
Bluetooth

646
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
The Sig

647
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,208
Is going to be bringing audio

648
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,256
To Bluetooth low energy

649
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,072
So there are actually two radios happening

650
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,656
We talk about when we talk about Bluetooth is a whole one is Bluetooth

651
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
The classic version

652
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,496
And the others Bluetooth low energy

653
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:50,336
So a lot of your devices that do audio

654
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
Are using Bluetooth

655
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
It's classic

656
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
Because

657
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
Bluetooth low energy

658
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
Was too small

659
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,296
Too small for audio

660
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Great

661
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,904
So what I'm worried about

662
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:09,024
Or what I've been kind of thinking about what my brain automatically went to when I heard this was hey

663
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
Are we going to end up with

664
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,168
Bluetooth classic being kind of useless as we bring

665
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
Everything into

666
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,496
Ble Bluetooth low energy

667
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,544
I'm kind of like

668
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
I asked the guys that is

669
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
This was a marketing guy

670
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,688
No plus this is like 2018 stuff

671
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
She's like over the long-term though

672
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,552
It does become

673
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Question

674
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,344
Bluetooth classic

675
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
So

676
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,928
Going further down the road

677
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,024
We might end up with you don't Bluetooth low-energy and Bluetooth mesh

678
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
And we'll kind of

679
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,096
See what happens to the old.

680
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,680
I should also say the exciting thing about Bluetooth low energy

681
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:52,032
An audio is they're going to get a chance to revisit the audio codecs

682
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,848
That's the compression

683
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
Because some of those

684
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Our Lake

685
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,200
10-15 years old so

686
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,736
We're going to get some more modern

687
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,552
Kodak switch make car audio sound a lot better and that would be

688
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Good for everybody

689
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:11,232
So I can actually speak to that from product I'm already using that takes advantage of higher Bluetooth audio streaming quality

690
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,584
Which I believe is being incorporated into

691
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
Some

692
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,424
New devices and maybe minutes the standard foot

693
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,704
Love to see how that plays out

694
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,104
Basically ldac is a high-quality wireless audio via Bluetooth mechanism that's the date

695
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,176
Need a transmission of a standard Bluetooth which is the eighth

696
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
2dp protocol

697
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
That's 328 kbps

698
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,552
Cenizas 990

699
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,856
Kbps you get more data

700
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,136
In the Stream

701
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
Through the Outback

702
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,720
So that's kind of like I don't know

703
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,536
Bluetooth is the Sadies going to adopt that or not but

704
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,584
It's already available in Sony's

705
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,168
High-end headphones which I happen to buy as well Sony's mobile phones

706
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Pensive

707
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:56,288
Alright before we get to Kevin's installation dramafun

708
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,616
It is time to tell you guys who won the wink Hub last week

709
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176
Auctioned off is not

710
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
Not the right word

711
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,272
We are the giveaway of my version 1

712
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
Link up

And

714
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:12,672
We got lots of awesome responses and I'm still going through the questions some of you guys are like

715
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,720
I want to wake up and I have a question for you

716
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
I'm circling through

717
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,048
Your questions because

718
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Because time

719
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
But

720
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
Doug Schreiber

721
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,168
Is our lucky

722
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
Winner

723
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,496
Come on down

724

Giardino's

725
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Send an email

726
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
And you know

727
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,616
We can totally do this again

728
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
If you guys thought that was fun and

729
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
Moving right along Kevin

730
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,040
Your Kwikset

731
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:45,184
This will not take long but it's disappointing my purchased

732
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,976
Kwikset Z-Wave lock

733
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,024
The 910 I believe

734
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,304
On Amazon about

735
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,584
2 months ago

736
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:56,448
The reason I purchased it even though I had one as I had to swap out the Finish iodide

737
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,496
Meet my HOA standards here

738
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:03,360
I need a brass and then just had my front door replaced last week

739
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,944
So got the front door replaced but in the new lock

740
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:13,344
And for the life of me could not get it to connect I mean I tried dozens of times

741
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,416
Couldn't get it to connect to my new wink Hub to sound like

742
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:21,280
Is it not supported anymore what's the deal but no supporting like it still supported

743
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:25,376
Crazy me I ordered another one of the reason I ordered another one

744
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
Too late

745
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:30,240
To return the one I bought from Amazon so I'm kind of disappointed in that but

746
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
That's life

747
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
Got the new one

748
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,592
It too is a 9/10 but the

749
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,384
Box is actually different

750
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,432
So it looks like I got a newer

751
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
Version of the Kwikset

752
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,296
Insure another pair right away and I'm all good

753
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,600
I had to buy two locks

754
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,928
It is what it is

755
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,536
I thought it might be because the new Z-Wave plus I'm on the wink Hub 2 but I don't think it is

756
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,096
Did you do next

757
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,400
I did exclusion zip

758
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,680
Natural

759
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,752
Pro tip for people who are like listen to this voice

760
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
Which I listening to

761
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
Kwikset

762
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,384
If you encounter the first thing you should do

763
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
If you have a Z-Wave

764
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,456
Device that doesn't pair to your hub

765
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,016
Is run the exclusion mode

766
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
On the Hub

767
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,088
And it basically unpair the device

768
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,928
So Z-Wave once you've paired a Z-Wave device to another Z-Wave device

769
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
It's

770
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Are there for Life in

771
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Excluded

772
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
7

773
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
And usually that

774
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,864
Solve the problem

775
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
But

776
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912
This case

777
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:31,936
Not

778
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:32,960
Don't know

779
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:38,592
Dona could just be a bad block on the production line when it doesn't matter

780
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
I still think you should be

781
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,176
I think so too but

782
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
It doesn't matter what I think

783
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,576
Clearly I bought a second one from them

784
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
All right

785
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
That feels like

786
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,512
All right that's enough for this week show

787
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
Stay tuned

788
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,328
For our guests who is Dan

789
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:03,936
Herscovici of Comcast talking about its purchase of icontrol

790
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
Why

791
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,240
He doesn't like Z-Wave

792
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,032
And a lot more

793
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,104
Comcast plan for smart home world domination

794
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,128
That's going to come in

795
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,784
A word from our sponsor hey everyone we are taking a break for The Internet of Things

796
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,648
Podcast to bring you a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Samsung artik

797
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:28,512
And we have Curtis Sasaki of Samsung here alright so let's kick this off with just a

798
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,304
Quick sense of what

799
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,096
Samsung artik is

800
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:36,704
Samsung built a hardware platform to make it easier to actually build

801
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Iot products

802
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
Harborside

803
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,616
Who's also built the cloud for years ago we noticed that none of these

804
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
Products actually work together

805
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:50,784
So we sat upon a mission to build the cloud that actually makes improper buddy much much easier

806
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,624
Interoperability is a huge problem I know you and I have talked about it is it

807
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
Consumer

808
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,720
But for businesses that actually has to be really hard

809
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,536
So how can using Artic help a business

810
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:07,936
Because we built the Cloud solution that makes it easy to connect lots of devices

811
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:14,336
Services we've already done that we're working with a company called Breezy who has an elder Care Management solution that works

812
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:18,944
Tablet so we can take advantage of an elderly person might be wearing a heart rate

813
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
Wearable

814
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Or

815
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,528
We may actually see that the light skin

816
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
Houses

817
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,320
Turn on and off

818
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
And without information they can know

819
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,160
Way more about what's happening in

820
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:34,560
Someone's home normally if you were to try to do it yourself you have to go and talk to every single manufacturer make business

821
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
And then do all immigration

822
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,680
Because artik cloud has already done all of that

823
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,752
Please you can take advantage of all the work that we've done

824
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,824
And create better solutions for elderly people

825
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,152
So this highlights that you can't build these products alone

826
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,200
So what have you guys learned

827
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,504
About building an ecosystem

828
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
When trying to build

829
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
What's an iot

830
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,904
Well we figured out on day one that

831
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,928
Even the sides

832
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
Company like Samsung

833
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,048
It was really important to find companies you could really bring

834
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,608
Their technology their expertise

835
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,656
And work with us together

836
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,472
And by building an ecosystem it actually helps

837
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
Other companies

838
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,568
We're actually trying to build iot Solutions

839
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,384
And get those products to Market much much easier

840
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,712
So we're very excited about the partners behalf who bring in

841
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
You technology

842
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,552
And we're very excited to also work with new companies

843
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,112
Ideas and capabilities

844
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
Great thanks for your time Curtis

845
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,792
Aging parents I definitely want to look into how iot can transform Healthcare

846
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,584
You can learn more about how Breezy

Hey everyone welcome back to the internet.

859
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:14,656
Thing show this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and I have Dan herscovici who is the head of Comcast

860
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
Xfinity home business

861
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
Hi Dan

862
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
Hey Stacy how you doing

863
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,776
I am doing super well today

864
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
So

865
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,336
You're in town for South by Southwest

866
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
And

867
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,384
We just did a bunch of

868
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,432
Conversations about voice which was super

869
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,504
So why don't we start with idea of

870
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,296
Where is Comcast now

871
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,832
With Xfinity home

872
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:33,856
So

873
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:40,512
If you go back to our founding we found the business in June of 2012 that's when we launched

874
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
Xfinity home

875
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,816
Nationwide

876
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:46,912
We offer home security and home automation solutions to all of our subscribers

877
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:53,312
I'm in as the business has grown dramatically the core of our business has been home security

878
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,896
I'm really the thing that resonated with customers

879
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:03,552
Was this evolution of home security the migration from an unconnected security system to a connected security system in what is it

880
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,832
Connected security system

881
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:10,208
Give you it allows you to arm and disarm remotely allows you to receive push notifications that allows you to see

882
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:16,096
History and tracking in your home but even more so the Xfinity Home Solution allows you to add

883
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:22,240
Not only life safety security like Solutions solutions that call the police call the fire department call the ambulance

884
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,312
Which is traditional but we will buy a home security system

885
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
But also

886
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:31,712
Peace of Mind automation what I mean by that is layering cameras leering and door locks

887
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:38,368
Play to not only does does the Xfinity home connected security system layering all the things that you

888
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,160
Expect the security system to do

889
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
But also

890
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,976
Ads on peace of mind it's

891
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
This is where

892
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:48,096
What is very popular today cameras door locks doorbells garage door openers

893
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,376
Things that

894
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:53,728
Aren't necessarily emergency services but provide you peace of mind did the dog walker

895
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,496
Girl arrived

896
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,056
Did the babysitter arrive

897
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,848
Do my kids get home from school okay

898
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,664
Did the Amazon package that I know was delivered

899
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
Move

900
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
After it was delivered

901
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
Is it still at my front

902
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:08,064
These are all things that is do I have a water leak

903
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,368
These are all things that

904
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,440
Don't necessarily need to call the authorities

905
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,464
But I'll give you

906
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,024
Comfort and peace of mind in a connection to your home

907
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
That you otherwise didn't have

908
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
I think

909
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:24,192
That's where we evolved to when we continue to grow we can talk me to go to the ecosystem

910
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,496
Please continue to grow the experiences we offer

911
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,312
And we continue to integrate them across our service

912
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:36,224
So why would I get something like this from my ISP as opposed to ATT or another service

913
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,528
That's a great question when do we get as a spur

914
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
Only I think

915
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,208
That only Comcast can go give you experiences that are integrated across your services so from Comcast for buying

916
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
Video

917
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
Internet

918
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,816
And Android security solution

919
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:57,216
So first and foremost you can interact with and control your security system from cool things like your TV the biggest screen in your house

920
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,776
We offer a kind of end-to-end

921
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,616
A support installation in a way that nobody else does I that you know

922
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,152
I know that sometimes

923
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:09,760
Isps or mso's might get a little bit of a bad rap but the reality is

924
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,296
We deal with

925
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,344
The less-than technically inclined

926
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,440
And were used to handling those those types of calls in the fact that we have

927
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,232
People that go into your home and

928
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:25,632
And repair and teeccino Justin you have a phone number you can call single phone number regardless of the device at senior

929
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,448
Are home seems comforting to people that are perhaps

930
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,520
Concerns about not knowing what to do when a device is offline

931
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,800
Alright so

932
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,848
We've established why am I want this

933
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:38,688
You guys have actually brought in a number of Partners

934
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
I think 9

935
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,040
Was was the last count I had and maybe that's different now

936
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
But

937
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,880
How do you choose what companies you want to work with

938
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,440
Our philosophy is to be open

939
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,512
And to be as easy to integrate with

940
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,560
As possible so we want to make it

941
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:59,168
You want to make the integration process the the the the the work required

942
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,472
To join our system to be very easy

943
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,032
That said we believe in a curated

944
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
Ecosystem one where

945
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,848
Comcast

946
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,432
DP test and evaluate these devices not only

947
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:16,832
Did this company do the integration properly but is this a great door lock is this a great garage door opener is this

948
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,880
Is the right light switch for me

949
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:22,208
And we test those devices we test those devices in our labs

950
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,280
Once again as in their intended environment in

951
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:29,376
Noisy WiFi environments in ways that consumers might use them everyday

952
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400
And so

953
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:34,496
We hand-selected you know we'll deal with large and small companies as long as

954
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,032
They pass over yours quality

955
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
And

956
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,360
We stand behind those quality test so

957
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,432
If your inner ecosystem we will support your device

958
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
So when you call

959
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
Comcast

960
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:50,880
And you have a problem with your Chamberlain garage door opener your Lutron light or your nest thermostat or your

961
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:54,464
August door lock or Yale door lock Schlage door lock

962
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,000
You know we will help you

963
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,840
In probably deal with 80% of the questions that might have otherwise gotten

964
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,168
Bounce around to different vendors and frustrated you know

965
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:09,056
As a frustrated individual on many cases I thank you for that

966
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,640
I do not live in a Comcast area so guys I've never experienced

967
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,968
Okay let's go by the business here because

968
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,296
Right now I feel like we've got a lot of crap in the market

969
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,832
Just crazy stuff happening

970
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,624
You guys are creating

971
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
This

972
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,928
I'm going to call it it's expensive

973
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,720
Like from a DIY mine

974
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,048
From a mainstream perspective I don't even know if there's really

975
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,840
Is there a demand for it

976
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
What's the business here

977
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:37,472
So it's a to think about it this way let's let's let's take a step back

978
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,776
Depends on what you're calling expensive right

979
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,080
Each of these individual devices

980
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:46,432
You know if you take them to the garage door opener in the door lock on the door bell and the

981
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,200
Camera

982
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,528
What do you get from us or not is going to end up costing hundreds and

983
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,064
The dollars the question is

984
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,624
How do you bring those devices together

985
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,440
I'm in a way that lets you get the most value out of the money

986
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,744
I think of Comcast is

987
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,048
Developing an underlying base platform

988
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
And that platform is

989
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,864
Automation in

990
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
And

991
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,936
We're going to put that platform in every house

992
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,728
On top of that platform

993
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,008
We will

994
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,592
We will sell Services we will offer you services that you find Value

995
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:18,944
The first disarm security it's the one that people understand it's the one that's the most

996
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,272
The most compelling to Consumers today

997
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:27,392
And we sell the home security service but back home security service still sits on top of this underlying

998
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:33,280
We will sell a video service so last April we launched 24/7 video recording

999
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,608
As attached to Xfinity home but soon it'll be

1000
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
Sold as a standalone

1001
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,680
So now you have

1002
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:44,288
Video recording and video analytics and all the things that come with that type of experience

1003
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,104
That's once again a standalone service sold on top of this song

1004
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,664
And will Laren

1005
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,480
Energy management and other services along the

1006
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,528
The key is

1007
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
That we are in Bedding

1008
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:01,184
The underlying platform in that in everybody's household we're doing that

1009
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,768
By placing the software stack in the control in the Gateway

1010
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,632
And there's a lot more to come on that but it's a it's a quite exciting development and then imagine

1011
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
You know our

1012
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
Scale

1013
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
Quite impactful so

1014
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,544
So when you talk about deploying the solution

1015
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:20,128
And everybody skate we are talking about tens of millions of households

1016
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,688
That we can affect very very quickly

1017
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
You guys just

1018
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:30,112
Well I don't know if it was a big deal for you guys but it felt like a big deal for the smart home space

1019
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
So

1020
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,952
You should probably Define press what part of I control you bought

1021
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,000
And tell us what you guys plan to do with it

1022
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,608
So I control service to Major consumer

1023
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
More customers

1024
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
To say who then service

1025
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
One part of eye control

1026
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,032
Call call converge

1027
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:53,151
I serviced mostly Comcast and other

1028
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,431
MSO

1029
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,015
The other part of eye control called connect

1030
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,807
Their major customer with ATT

1031
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,855
And so you know some other man

1032
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,671
So essentially split the company into

1033
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,535
I'm we bought in the end of the development organizations everything was

1034
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,351
Was very separate so it's not that difficult to separate the

1035
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,399
Which organization was based in Austin

1036
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
And the other connect

1037
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
It was based in

1038
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,471
Redwood City

1039
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,775
So we bought the the converge business

1040
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,799
The Austin team

1041
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,639
And it's been it's been a great experience we

1042
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,199
Yo I control has been the

1043
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,783
Core software engine behind their security system since the day we launched

1044
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:34,111
We know the team really well we work with them every day

1045
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,671
And having them part of the Comcast family

1046
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,463
Allows us to

1047
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,767
Just accelerate development and accelerating

1048
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,815
Innovation I'm also excited to

1049
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,607
Being Austin and crate up

1050
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,423
Create a Technology Center of Excellence in Austin

1051
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,543
That kind of attract employees that we otherwise wouldn't have access to

1052
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,615
I'm and I'm excited to come into the wholesale business so

1053
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,919
Everything we talked about for the past few no

1054
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
Few minutes here

1055
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,735
It's been about service and consumers

1056
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:04,575
Pretty soon with this acquisition we were servicing other

1057
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,367
Cable companies in there

1058
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:10,975
Security solution so we'll have a you in a bigger reach to consumer that we otherwise would because

1059
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,023
Cox and Charter and Rogers

1060
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
In Canada

1061
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,095
Oral going to be on the same platform

1062
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:20,191
And all the things I've talked about all the features and functionality that we've discussed

1063
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,471
Will then be passed on to those

1064
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:25,567
Now other than yourselves I feel like a lot of the isps

1065
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,847
Have they started

1066
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,407
Like Verizon had an effort to do a smart home

1067
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,199
AT&T had Digital Life

1068
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,503
Time Warner Cable which is now Spectrum

1069
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,039
Also did but

1070
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,343
They really backed off at

1071
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,903
Will Time Warner and Spectrum are

1072
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,951
Continuing forward under the charter brand I think

1073
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
I think you'll see more there

1074
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,255
But you're right

1075
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
And

1076
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:45,791
I think

1077
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,095
The challenge has always been

1078
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,631
The business

1079
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,959
Prom is the business opportunity in the Smart Home

1080
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,495
Versus the business reality

1081
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,871
We stumbled a bit too in the beginning because we placed equal weight

1082
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,639
With

1083
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,431
Business opportunity on

1084
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:05,503
How fast will smart home technology grow will the consumer

1085
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
MyPay

1086
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,807
Is there value there

1087
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,135
Versus home security and we quickly realized the way

1088
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,671
To win in the short-term

1089
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,487
What's the laser focus on the home security experience

1090
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:21,887
Add smart home and automation capabilities underneath that umbrella but really focus on

1091
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
Home Security

1092
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,471
It wasn't until recently by recently I mean

1093
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,263
You know April of last year

1094
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,799
That we really started to

1095
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,335
Your venture out again

1096
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,383
Could we turn down or stand alone

1097
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,663
Offerings

1098
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,991
Into the the automation space namely

1099
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,783
24/7 video recording

1100
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,319
And you're soon to see

1101
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:44,159
You know other launches from us around thermostats Energy Management so

1102
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,999
We're tiptoeing our way back but we're doing so in a slightly different way more

1103
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,535
Focused measured

1104
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:54,143
Experience so we know that consumers value video so let's nail the video experience

1105
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:54,911
Let's Nacho

1106
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,959
Offer hundreds of devices that people can

1107
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,983
Potentially by

1108
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,055
Let's really nail a singular experience that we know people love

1109
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:07,455
So once again it's kind of like think of home security is a vertical that we've focused on and then we're going to layer in other verticals along the

1110
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,479
That's

1111
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:12,063
I think the more better recipe for Success versus

1112
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,879
What we seen previously and why others kind of stumbled

1113
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,463
By which is vomit up some sensors and devices and hope it all

1114
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
Right

1115
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
All right

1116
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,583
What about standards because this is a huge thing that

1117
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,399
God we are still talking about 5 years in

1118
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
Or longer really

1119
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,495
Do you guys feel like you need standards for the Smart Home

1120
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,031
So I struggle

1121
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,311
With the database

1122
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,383
I see a need it's beneficial it would be helpful

1123
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,943
But I don't know that it's holding back innovation in

1124
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:43,295
Look we because of the nature of how we build our

1125
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,087
Standards are valuable

1126
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,463
If we want to just essentially allow anybody to join the ecosystem untested

1127
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,999
And so that it would just work

1128
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,303
But what are approach

1129
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,887
Has been to test and evaluate and cheery this ecosystem

1130
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:02,239
So what you know what are you connected over Wifi or Bluetooth or zigbee

1131
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:05,311
Is invisible to the consumer it doesn't really matter

1132
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:09,663
You know there's some stand popular standards older standards that we don't support namely the

1133
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,479
The one that comes to mind when people talk about us a Z-Wave

1134
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,271
But other than Z-Wave

1135
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:18,367
Amway support everything else and everything just works and I think there's a lot of

1136
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:24,767
Reasons why we don't support Z-Wave that have to do with it security and coverage in the home and reliability all the things that

1137
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,559
We talk about when we

1138
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,839
Talk about you know

1139
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,655
Having a curated solution that we know is reliable

1140
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,703
I think we are from our point of view

1141
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:36,543
We made the right decision and we support the devices that matter most

1142
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,103
The big debate right now in

1143
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,895
Smart home is actually security

1144
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:45,503
My God I cannot go a day without some stupid connected device getting hat

1145
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:49,343
So how do you guys view Security on the Comcast platform

1146
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,647
And security overall in the industry

1147
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,719
Look I mean security is top-of-mind

1148
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:59,839
For us and for the consumer we find the consumer asking those questions more and more lately

1149
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,167
I'm we take obviously we take security very seriously

1150
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,215
Frankly we have a dedicated

1151
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,007
It security team

1152
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:13,407
Just an Xfinity home in addition to what you might expect as being a very large eyes p a large corporate security team and we all

1153
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,175
Work together

1154
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:18,527
The encryption standards we use for our video product than any other

1155
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,855
Solutions are similar encryption standards for

1156
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,647
Bank and financial transactions

1157
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,695
I think that there are

1158
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:29,023
Without revealing too much there are benefits

1159
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:35,167
To being both the ISP and the provider that manages your your devices I mean

1160
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,983
We if a device is behaving

1161
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
Badly

1162
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,567
We can see that faster and quicker

1163
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:45,663
Because we are the ISP and I think that provides a layer of security that

1164
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,711
Perhaps others may not may not be able to

1165
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:51,551
And what about your partner's how far do you check their security

1166
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:55,647
So that's once again I mean it's a really great friend with a glad you raised it because

1167
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,487
The third pillar is not only do we test do they do the integration

1168
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,791
Probably not only do we test are they good

1169
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,327
Door lock for garage door opener

1170
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,447
But we do our own penetration testing we do our own it security testing and

1171
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:14,591
And we've found vulnerabilities that we've been gone back and asked the manufacturer to correct before we were willing

1172
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:18,175
22 undisclosed unnamed

1173
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
Light bulb manufacturer

1174
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,039
Had challenges and we wouldn't launch their lightbulb until they

1175
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:29,439
They address them and I think they appreciate frankly they appreciated it just as much as we appreciated their react

1176
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,975
Action their speed of response

1177
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,767
The fact they took it seriously

1178
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:36,351
I think there's not there's benefit the ecosystem of wrong the way we're approaching the

1179
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:41,983
You guys have a really cool advantage and being an ISP and also having the router in there because I think

1180
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:46,079
There's a lot of talk about doing security at the router level

1181
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,127
Is that something you guys are thinking about it

1182
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,407
Launching for Xfinity

1183
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
Yes

1184
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,479
Stacy

1185
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:58,879
That's a good plan we are looking at it we take it we think it so it isn't very very interesting opportunity as long as the

1186
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,671
There's horsepower in the router

1187
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,695
To do all the things that you

1188
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,487
A lot of people

1189
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,023
Talked about this idea

1190
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
Having a company come in and being

1191
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,375
Security provider for the smart

1192
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,959
And it seems like an ISP might be in a really interesting

1193
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,239
Place to do something

1194
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,287
This website is

1195
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,079
Got Junior ISP maker

1196
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,383
Make sure everything secure anyway if they're offering this

1197
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:24,479
Maybe it's maybe it's password management maybe it's

1198
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:29,343
You know authenticating devices I I don't really understand how people think this might happen but

1199
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:35,487
UC Comcast getting into some sort of business like that it's like malware for the whole my dad I mean I think that

1200
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:39,583
Look what's what's but whether or not we're going to get into the Uber going to charge customers

1201
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,375
Decide cuz that's

1202
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,167
There are a lot of things we can do

1203
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
Some

1204
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:49,311
You should be likely included at no additional cost and some might be a premium feature that maybe

1205
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,615
I'm have some real cost that we incur

1206
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,943
That we want you know and only like a subset of the Cavs

1207
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
Super Bass mic

1208
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:59,807
We are seriously looking at it we think there's a lot of

1209
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,343
Of opportunity there

1210
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,391
Personally I use a password manager

1211
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,183
Or I don't know I have

1212
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:08,511
Edward as with most people have dozens and dozens of accounts

1213
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:13,375
And you know I won't you know advertising here but I use a great password manager

1214
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,423
And that that's an interesting

1215
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,239
An interesting space but more so

1216
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:24,383
If all of a sudden an iot device that for the past year has always spoken to

1217
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,431
You know camera.com

1218
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:30,015
And all the sudden starts talking to camera. Are you

1219
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:35,391
Not many people can see that immediately and that's an interesting alert that something might be going wrong

1220
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,927
I have a router that does that

1221
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,207
All right

1222
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:42,047
