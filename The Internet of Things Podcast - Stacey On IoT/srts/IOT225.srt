00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,952
We'll also hear from our sponsor Dell Technologies

30
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,976
Talking about

31
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,000
Retail

33
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
Is

34
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
Rags srinivasan

35
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
Of Seagate

36
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:14,752
He's talking about how Seagate has implemented a i and

37
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,520
Cameras

38
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,824
To improve their manufacturing process

39
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,152
It's a really great interview he really

40
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,688
Does a great job explaining

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
How they did this

42
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,784
And why they made the decisions they did

43
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,368
And anybody who's trying to implement any sort of iot or

44
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
Shooting at the edge should really listen

45
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,720
Elvis

46
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
Coming up but first

47
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
IMessage from another one

48
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
One of our sponsors

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,888
This week sponsor is a pharaoh

50
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,192
We're doing multiple iot projects

51
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
The work well together

52
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,032
In a single app that strengthens your brand

53
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
That's really hard and it requires the right platform with a pharaoh Kenmore Lodge 42 smart

54
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,832
Appliance models in just two years apparel customers have experienced as much as a 80% reduction in time to mark

55
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:06,208
99% pure support calls and a 10x higher activation rate

56
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:10,560
Plus we can reuse 90% of their work from one project to the next

57
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,960
Make a pharaoh like Kenmore Mitsubishi baked and dealing did and beat your competition with a solution that you're

58
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,544
13 loves to build and your customers love to use

59
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,640
Learn more at a pharaoh. IO flash go big

60
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
Okay

61
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
Hey Kevin

62
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Right after

63
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
Recorded the show last

64
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
We heard

65
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,088
Big news from

66
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Belgian Dulce

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
The journalist at

68
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,512
Svrta Belgian broadcaster brought the news

69
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:47,168
That's rather scary I guess we shouldn't be surprised by this because smart speakers we know they listen to us

70
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,496
But what happens after that we're finding out more

71
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,080
Google is saving all of those voice recordings

72
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,896
And using contractors to

73
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,432
Transcribe them which

74
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,736
I supposed to improve the voice

75
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
Results right

76
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
They're using it to make sure every

77
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
Correct

78
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
But

79
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,672
What was shocking to me was I had read in

80
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,464
How to say was a CNET article

81
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,792
When Amazon had the same story come out about them

82
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
Probably a month ago

83
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,192
Google said that they actually use voice modulation so people couldn't understand

84
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,240
Or identify the voices

85
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
And this is proving that completely wrong

86
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
Sound like

87
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,408
That's really sad cuz I really thought that was a good thing for

88
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
Google to be doing

89
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,552
Yeah it's that was probably one of the I should laugh out of it one of the funniest things in this

90
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
In this article that came from brt

91
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,440
We let ordinary Flemish people hear some of their own recordings it says

92
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
And here's a quote

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,816
This is undeniably my own voice says one man clearly surprised

94
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Yeah

95
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
And

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
The big thing for me

97
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
Isn't it

98
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
Google or Amazon

99
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
Annotate sand has to

100
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Pick up

101
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,336
Will recordings and make sure you're in check it for

102
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
Accuracy

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
I feel like that has to have

104
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,200
And it makes sense that that happens I would like to see

105
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Any

106
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
Buddy who's doing this

107
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
And sending it on

108
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
The contractors to actually

109
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
Modular people's voices so that's not

110
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,208
Grenadier still be identifiable in

111
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,744
Information if there's addresses since

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Stuff in there

113
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,863
What really caught my eye here and made me really uncomfortable

114
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
What's the false positives

115
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,239
So brt had over a thousand recordings

116
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
In

117
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
That

118
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
153

119
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,895
We're triggered without someone saying the words

120
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Haji

121
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
I don't want to say the words

122
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
So

123
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Tennessee

124
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Rentable

125
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
False positive

126
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
That's

127
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
15% at its highest

128
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
We don't actually know

129
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
What more than a thousand is

130
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
Less than 2000

131
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
But wear them

132
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
That's too high

133
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,703
It is and you think at this point considering all of the

134
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
Breakthrough analysis and

135
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,591
Syrian technology and math that Google has been applying to its NLP

136
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
You would think they wouldn't have that

137
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
Iowa

138
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
False positive rate by now

139
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
Yeah well

140
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,575
You would think that and I remember someone

141
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
From Google talking about

142
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
Using a a I in

143
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
Smart Homes and

144
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,463
Using AI to

145
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
Autonomy

146
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
And he talked about the false positive

147
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,119
Rates in for something to actually automatically happen

148
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,423
They wanted to see a false positive

149
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
1%

150
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
Port to take action

151
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
Now

152
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
Privacy is not the same as like ordering

153
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
You think someone's

154
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
If you think someone wants

155
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
A pizza

156
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
But

157
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
I would like to see privacy move

158
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Up in

159
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,343
Is there a steam or rankings so

160
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,903
Maybe your false positive rate is more like

161
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
5%

162
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
That's still pretty high but

163
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,815
To me it makes up for the inconvenience if you

164
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,119
So what I I guess

165
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
It's time to stop talking

166
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
About

167
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
Things like this is a violation of

168
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Our privacy and I think it

169
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,567
It's time to actually talk about what we should see

170
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,383
So our Dimension voice modulation

171
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,919
I would also like to

172
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,015
Public audit independent yes

173
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
Independent public

174
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
Got its worst case scenario

175
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
I would like to see

176
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
Google published

177
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Are false positive

178
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
And

179
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
Probably

180
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,559
Publish the percent of recordings

181
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
That are sent to

182
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
Contract

183
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,447
Discus people information that

184
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,751
Could really help them decide cuz right now it's like

185
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
And

186
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
They should say where those car

187
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:44,223
Wendy's in the story these contractors were actually local to the area where the recordings were

188
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
Where the speakers were

189
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
It's not like they're

190
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,343
In this case they were farmed around the world

191
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
Look like

192
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
And I should say

193
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,231
I was a contractor for Google for 18 months

194
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,791
And I had to sign all the same nda's and all that

195
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,631
In my case I presume that standard practice ER

196
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
Just to get people that information

197
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
Sure Google is really pissed Google's

198
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,543
Google slide is like yeah but these guys broke

199
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Brocar NBA

200
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
I'm like Google

201
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,431
They did but what you're doing here isn't

202
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
Exactly right

203
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,039
I know a lot of people are saying hey this is how these things

204
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
And I agree with that

205
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,439
That doesn't mean they have to be that way yeah and it doesn't mean that that's

206
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,767
That particular false positive rate is okay or that

207
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,095
You know you shouldn't take steps to preserve people's privacy in the

208
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
When you're using

209
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,423
Real contractors and not just

210
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,775
Kind of related to this actually very religious and very Timely

211
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,335
How does Amazon actually

212
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,639
Check the recordings will they give you the option

213
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
In the app

214
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
2

215
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
Spaceway say hey I heard this

216
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,319
Padme says that this is what you meant is

217
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
Do the right thing right

218
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
So in a sense we all helped train or can that waste

219
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
I bet most people don't go in there and do this but

220
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
We all help Madame a

221
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
The funny thing is

222
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
And the story broke

223
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
Last week

224
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
Over the weekend

225
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
An infectious yesterday

226
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
I got the Google Assistant

227
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,823
Pop up on my screen on my Chromebook

228
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
And said hey

229
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,479
Please read that last voice command and I had actually said to come into my Google

230
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
Home device my smart display

231
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,831
To raise the volume I was listening to Spotify

232
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,159
And they gave me a ranking and then I can leave a comment as well

233
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,999
So I had never seen that before the story

234
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
Coincidence

235
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
Maybe

236
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
I'm wondering

237
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
How recently

238
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
I don't know

239
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
Time is like a river for me

240
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Close

241
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,823
Cuz I'm on these devices all day long and

242
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
It's built into my Chromebook and I have all the

243
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,175
Display I never seen it

244
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
Don't care about your opinion

245
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
Maybe they only care about buying them

246
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,087
People like you made it obvious he doesn't work anymore for a reason that's not even bother with this guy

247
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,647
Yes so I will say

248
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,695
Given this news and

249
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
The lack of

250
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
For me it was the false positive

251
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
The Lacs

252
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
Protection here

253
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:11,935
Does this change your comfort level with having these around your house is the convenience still

254
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
Worth it to you

255
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Well it's

256
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,103
It's funny you say that because I am not having a change of heart and things because I've always

257
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,455
Just put myself out there with all these devices and sensors and social networks

258
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:28,319
But over the past couple weeks I have been rethinking everything as more and more these

259
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Types of

260
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
Privacy intrusions in

261
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Data

262
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
Hacks and things

263
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Going to

264
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
You know up here

265
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:41,119
I'm probably not going to change the way I use these devices

266
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
But I think I'm

267
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,191
A little more aware of

268
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,031
Basically maybe when I want to say and why don't at times

269
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,359
And it sounds silly cuz I'm in my own home and I should be able to say what I want

270
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
Well here

271
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Let me tell you

272
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,991
So there's some options for people who still want to use

273
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
Space and they range from

274
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
You probably should do this to

275
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:05,183
Wow this is pretty extreme so first option is you can switch off recording

276
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
For Google

277
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
Devices

278
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
And you just go into

279
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
Your Google account in web and app at

280
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
You can manage your activity

281
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
Controls

282
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,751
And there's a section called voice and audio activity

283
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
And you can

284
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,591
Pause that so I have mine pause

285
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,663
And that means it doesn't make recordings

286
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
Voice so I can't send those

287
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
What does mean I'm not

288
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
But I did turn that off

289
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
A while back

290
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
So anyone can do that

291
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,207
You can always go and delete your old recordings as well

292
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
And so those will be gone

293
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
And

294
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
Going forward

295
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,119
If you're really uncomfortable you can turn off the microphone

296
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,447
On your Google devices and on your Amazon

297
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Devices

298
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
And then

299
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
It won't be listen

300
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
And then I won't be listened

301
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,079
But then it also when you shout across the room

302
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,479
To be honest I've actually done that little more than I used to do as of late

303
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,319
Like if I'm not going to be accurately

304
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,903
Google do something for me here at my office or example

305
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
Like if I know I

306
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,071
Just want peace and quiet I'm not going to want music I don't care if somebody sure comes the doorbell even it was still show me that

307
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
Manhattan Town Center in

308
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
I have in my coffee

309
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
If I know I'm going to be

310
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
Changing music and

311
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,007
You know maybe want to ask Google some questions

312
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
I turn it back on

313
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
Additionally again

314
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,919
My Chromebook has Google Assistant built-in

315
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,991
There's an option if you have a Chromebook that has the support

316
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,039
You can in the settings

317
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,391
You can have it on for always listening or not always listening which is effectively

318
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Shutting off B

319
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,767
The microphone from listening all the time and it said there's a Google Assistant key that you can hit

320
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,583
To any basically take the place of a

321
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,167
Awake work that's exciting cuz if you're working at your desk you leave them

322
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,775
All right yeah interior I could still change things

323
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Music

324
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
What not so

325
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,127
There are options and we should probably mention

326
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
Only because we talked about it last week I believe

327
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,015
The Google home local SDK

328
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,599
Is now available for developers and what that should do

329
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
Is not send I think

330
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,975
You should send a recording to the cloud because all going to happen all the

331
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,023
Language should happen on the device

332
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,327
Yes we'll see it how that actually

333
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Exactly

334
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
We're looking for today

335
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
All right

336
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
Moving on

337
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
This week

338
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
Big news in the

339
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
I'm going to call the pro

340
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
And even sort of the DIY smart home front

341
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,711
Which is a company called azlo his bought the assets of central

342
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,015
Probably back in

343
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
I don't know was it April

344
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
We talked about centralite

345
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,391
I filed for bankruptcy and centralite mayday

346
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
A bunch of

347
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,743
Sensors they made a bunch of zigbee sensors

348
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
They didn't see me anyway

349
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
They made a bunch of sensors they were lovely

350
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
I'm thinking in the world for a long time

351
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
And all of a sudden

352
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
It went bankrupt

353
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
Azlo

354
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
Has bought that

355
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
However

356
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,223
I had an email conversation with James Busby who is the

357
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,015
One of the founders of centralized

358
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Original Sin

359
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,367
Just to check in on where things were

360
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,671
And he says that

361
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
He's forming

362
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
2

363
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
Support old Central

364
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Projects

365
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
And

366
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,631
Tire repair in Salisbury

367
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,679
Hearts so hopefully

368
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,727
If you got a legacy system

369
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
You can

370
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Still

371
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Akai service that

372
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,687
And you can find that at www. Centralite support

373
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Dot-com

374
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
And

375
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
He's hoping that

376
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,367
After all of this goes down he'll be able to

377
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,975
Make new products as well and so it could be another company that is going to develop new II

378
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:58,655
That's a rather smart move on his part cuz usually when these companies go under that's it you know they're they're done people move on

379
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,471
Products are bought acquired Etc

380
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,007
But your support

381
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
Potential for older

382
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Devices now

383
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
I didn't see that happened to us

384
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
Yeah you really don't

385
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,943
And I should add that as low they actually

386
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,039
Acquired a company called me a house that was a smart home services platform

387
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
That made the Vera Z-Wave products

388
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,391
And they also in

389
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
October of last year purchased a couple

390
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
Fortress

391
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,511
Which was a leak detection in

392
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Sandfly prevention

393
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,631
So so is probably a company that we're going to see more of

394
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
Okay

395
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,311
600 Kevin

396
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
This is exciting chipped

397
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:45,759
It is you're the chip girl I mean it I like having chips but you really get into and I mean really in a ditch

398
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Baidu

399
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
Intel announced

400
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
A new chip

401
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
It mimics

402
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
Brain computer

403
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
And why does this matter

404
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
Okay long story short is

405
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
We have reached

406
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
Buford

407
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
Of

408
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,911
Which means we cannot pack more chips

409
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
McKenna

410
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,519
Get the power advancements and the energy

411
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Advancements

412
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
That we used to get

413
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,127
So no more shrinkage

414
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
Catch and

415
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
This is a problem

416
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
Because now we

417
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
Right we're going to try a new architecture

418
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
So Intel's new architecture is

419
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:25,439
Oh here we go he's names they're hard for me practice we practice but

420
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:30,559
Why don't African Palace 100 Intel announced an 8 million or under amorphic system

421
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,143
Price of 64 of what they called loihi

422
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
Research chip

423
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,239
That particular system is called

424
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
I'll do it

425
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
Poke

426
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
Pohoiki Beach

427
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
So all of this is on their

428
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,711
So lot of Hawaiian names

429
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Okay sure

430
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
But what this is is

431
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,343
They change the architecture such that

432
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,159
This particular chip can

433
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,975
Process information a thousand times faster

434
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,047
In ten thousand times more efficiently than a CPU

435
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
For certain Apple

436
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Locations

437
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
And

438
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
Some of those applications include

439
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
Mapping so the kind of

440
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Mapping the

441
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
Like your Roomba does in a room

442
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
The car does

443
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Something called sparse

444
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Coding

445
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
I don't know what's up

446
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:24,063
Will I have a general idea remember I'm only my third semester hero cop side but

447
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,623
Sparse learning is

448
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,439
Basically trying to take a lot of data

449
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,511
It is something and putting into something like a structure

450
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
Meridian dictionary

451
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,351
Not that Webster's Dictionary but take a dictionary

452
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Encode

453
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
And

454
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
What's parse

455
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,727
Learning should do

456
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
Is

457
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,823
Kind of represent the data with a few inputs as path

458
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
Aunt without losing

459
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
Too much

460
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
What it really means if that makes sense

461
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
So

462
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,271
If you have like a machine learning model flask

463
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
I have like a gazillion

464
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Data points

465
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,391
We need a lot of computing power to get through all of them

466
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,975
But you can model that data in a dictionary with far fewer points

467
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Accurately

468
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
You can

469
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
Run the computer for FasTrak

470
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Safeway

471
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,351
Plants versus

472
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
Okay

473
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
So

474
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,079
Intel has announced this it this is not something we expect to see used anytime

475
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
Truly so

476
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,919
They're researching how to put this particular

477
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
The loihi

478
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,991
On a USB stick

479
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,807
If they could do that we would see something like what they did with the

480
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,599
The movie Dias a position where they

481
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Put those

482
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,207
I put those chips on a USB stick in allowed people

483
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Go to play with them is

484
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
Set developer

485
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,607
So that was at the video computer vision

486
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
Chip acquisition so

487
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
That's kind of where I was

488
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
Expect to see this next that's the

489
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
The next thing I would see here

490
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,871
And if you're wondering ibm has been working on neuromorphic

491
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Computing

492
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,967
Other companies in the chip space have been working on this this is

493
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,527
Kind of one of the next big things but

494
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,575
What's likely to happen is where

495
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
Probably going to

496
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Figure

497
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,439
Some jobs for this

498
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:10,815
Amber still can have CPUs or still can have gpus but basically we're going to have more Ark

499
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
Pictures

500
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,399
Only because you mentioned neuromorphic

501
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
And we talked about architectures

502
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,287
The whole idea here if I'm understanding it is

503
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
The architecture they're using

504
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
Is cartoon mimic

505
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,663
The human brain

506
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,735
Synapses and so on would that be accurate

507
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:34,111
The brain is the most efficient computer and I remember as far back is like 2008 talking to

508
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
People who were trying to mimic

509
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
The brain

510
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
There's dozens of different

511
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Ways to do this

512
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
A lot of them hit

513
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,815
It's both a complex Computing problem

514
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
Just designing the stuff

515
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,143
Encoding problem

516
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
So this is

517
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
So far

518
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
Been promising but it's not scalable

519
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
By any stretch

520
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
Take all of this with the greatest

521
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,455
But speaking of chips here something that's actually real arm

522
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
This week

523
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,271
Has announced a new licensing

524
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,087
And I look at this and I'm like

525
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
Who who are

526
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
You are

527
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
You are reacting to

528
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,231
Threats at risk 5

529
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Respite

530
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
Open source architecture

531
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
Free chips

532
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
But

533
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,679
What arm has decided is they have a new licensing strata

534
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
So initially

535
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
If you want to build

536
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
An arm-based chip

537
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
Youlicense the Arctic

538
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
Texture from them

539
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
And then

540
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
You

541
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
Add stuff to it

542
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,223
So add stuff to their

543
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,063
Or you can buy an architectural

544
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
And that allows you to

545
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Change

546
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
The architecture

547
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,463
A little bit and so the big companies like Amazon Apple

548
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
Qualcomm

549
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,327
Etc day he'll have architecture licenses so they can

550
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Tweak that

551
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
A little bit

552
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
More granularly

553
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
But

554
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
What are missing now is

555
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,799
Instead of Licensing at the

556
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
The front end you can actually

557
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
Get access to the license

558
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
Design for a little bit

559
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,503
And then pay when you start taping out and see

560
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Finger chips

561
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
This is a big

562
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Change

563
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
Yeah

564
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,671
Well this opens up access for a lot of

565
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,743
Smaller companies that maybe don't have

566
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,791
The funds to pay the current

567
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,071
Licensing terms

568
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,887
And therefore they can't even get into this market for their product

569
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,191
That is so they can get in for much

570
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,239
Cheap price upfront

571
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,847
And then of course in both cases are charges a per-unit royalty

572
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
You don't have to worry about

573
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Bat

574
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
Until you taste

575
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Yeah but here's my question.

576
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,087
Okay I assume that you when you would license these things you have like some type of

577
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,623
NDA or something

578
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
Like how much

579
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,487
Inside information on the arm architecture going to have before you actually have to start

580
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
Oh but I think this is like any other lice

581
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
Which is now you

582
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
Get everything

583
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
You need to design a chip

584
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,703
When you sell it

585
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
Is when you pee

586
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
I think you get

587
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
Annie maybe they're Secret

588
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
Ricky's someone else who

589
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,383
Works with biscuit LS

590
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
For manufacturing

591
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,735
And there are two things that matter

592
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,295
What is what we just talked about with Intel how we

593
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:15,135
Hit the end of Moore's Law we've got so many different applications out there as weave

594
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Got chips yet

595
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
The range hood light

596
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,024
Supercomputing type jobs are cloud computing type jobs all the way down to like

597
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
Turning on and off

598
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
Sensor

599
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
So

600
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,912
Arm is hoping to take advantage of

601
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,472
That and let other companies licenses stuff

602
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,544
The other thing is what I said about risc V

603
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
They are seen

604
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,616
Companies choose to

605
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,200
Use the risc V architecture for things like iot

606
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,248
And I don't want to lose that business

607
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
So that's that's what happen

608
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Okay

609
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
Chips

610
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
God

611
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
Let's talk about

612
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:54,048
Wise last week I talked about the wise bulbs and I said something that was wrong

613
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
Cuz I couldn't

614
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
Kevin Quinn

615
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Why is people could

616
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
And I told us about it so

617
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,776
When I talk about the wise balls I said you

618
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
Could not tie it

619
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:09,664
To the sets are actually what I said I could not find a way to tie it to the sensors and that frustrated

620
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:14,016
And why's let me know that there is a way to tie the bulbs

621
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
Turn them on and off

622
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
To the sensors

623
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,624
The way you do that is you going to the home screen

624
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,696
And then you go into edit shortcuts

625
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
And you have to create a shortcut

626
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,048
You click on create a shortcut

627
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,096
You're going to pick your action

628
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,144
Your action is going to be a bulb

629
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
And then you're going to

630
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
Click on an automation

631
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
Are you going to say autumn

632
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
And then you're going to

633
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Pek

634
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,824
Bee sensor

635
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
And then

636
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
Walla

637
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
Yeah I'm glad it's there because it is

638
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,760
Just didn't make sense to not have the functionality

639
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,320
Maybe it's just because I really don't have one

640
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,136
Why is product at One wyze cam version 2

641
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Side door

642
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
Have anything connected

643
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,488
Too but even so I was looking all around

644
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
I can't find this thing

645
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
I didn't love

646
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,608
That but as I said last weekend.

647
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,936
I think this is design for people who may not

648
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Neither want all of that

649
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
It's so cheap

650
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,568
30 bucks for a bulbs in

651
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
People can just buy this

652
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
Play with a nap and

653
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
They may not want all this

654
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,224
Crazy stuff that you and I try to do

655
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,552
So otherwise newses

656
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,416
Yes and speaking of cheap

657
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
And why is that

658
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,464
The products are

659
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,024
Cheap crappy products there cheap good products

660
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,816
And wise

661
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,656
Debuting a Wi-Fi smart plug

662
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
2Pac

663
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,216
According to Home Depot's website

664
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,008
I'm looking at it right now it says

665
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,056
$19.98

666
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
Package

667
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
So they've got

668
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,664
2Pac Lee's Wi-Fi smart

669
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
Slugs they are just single

670
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Slugs

671
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,064
Some of them have two outlets know they may take one out and turn into two

672
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,112
But that's not the case

673
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
141 Outlets

674
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,696
Will work according to this with

675
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
Google

676
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
Also

677
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,352
Scheduling and as you just pointed out you can automate

678
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,632
Bwise plug

679
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,704
WIS license based on open closed and motion detection

680
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,008
Again according to this product website

681
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,056
Cool alright we'll look for that

682
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
Alright Chinese Wi-Fi

683
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
It is Wi-Fi

684
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,408
Because it's got power

685
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
It makes sense

686
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
Why is only does

687
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,808
A proprietary protocol for the sense devices cuz they're battery

688
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,368
Battery make sense so

689
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
All right

690
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,976
Quick news bet so we've got to run through these fast so let's go

691
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,048
Alphabet swing lunch is the Open Sky air traffic

692
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
Control platform for trone

693
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,704
This is interesting and it's already been in use in Australia

694
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,520
Alphabet swing group has

695
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:47,872
Got to post on medium for people who want to see all the bits of details but essentially

696
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,176
Things created Open Sky which is

697
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:50,944
A

698
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:57,600
A method of platform rather to understand flight rules with buildings roads trees and terrain all the stuff that

699
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Google has

700
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
Google Maps

701
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,720
And the idea is to help drones navigate safely

702
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:07,584
They'll even get information like if your drone is flying too close to a restricted area

703
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,912
Where there's an emergency in the area need to clear the air so

704
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
We'll see if people

705
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,264
Legends opensky platform as an expense

706
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,312
All right and my news is from

707
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,664
Ubiquiti link which is a satellite that I have to satellite play

708
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
And they have raised

709
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,504
5.2 million in seed funding

710
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,552
Total funding to 12 million

711
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:31,392
And this weekend they are going to do another satellite

712
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
Launch

713
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
I wrote about this

714
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
A while back

715
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,024
Basically they have built modules that allow

716
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,584
Devices to connect to their satellite Network

717
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,376
Satellite they don't have

718
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
Universal

719
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,936
Coverage yet so what happens is like

720
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
A couple times a day

721
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,264
The satellite will pass overhead and

722
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,288
You'll be able to send it

723
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,824
Little tiny message

724
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
They already have customers

725
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
So

726
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
It's a big deal

727
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,456
And funding is going to be

728
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
Useful

729
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,552
Obviously they have to launch and build all those smallsat

730
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
That's so there we have it

731
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Next up

732
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
Eve

733
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:07,488
The maker of homekit enabled Bluetooth sensors has announced

734
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
Brand new

735
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,840
Ble extender will be available in August in Europe

736
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
4

737
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,168
Almost fifty Euros which is about $56

738
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
And

739
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,544
This particular device basically extend your Bluetooth range

740
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
Yay

741
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,152
Because I hate Bluetooth that is not Bluetooth mesh because

742
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:29,248
Go upstairs you like I can't control my lights anymore

743
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,552
So that device will work

744
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
With Bluetooth accessories

745
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,904
And it will show you what

746
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,672
Range

747
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,792
Pick which ones it wants to assign to eat extend and

748
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,704
Yeah it seems like a good product for anyone who's all in on homekit and wants to add

749
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,752
Make their sensor experience

750
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Finally

751
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
You got our source ads

752
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
Security story of the day

753
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,712
Yeah we talked about this a while back and it

754
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
Soda has been mitigated but it's worth

755
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,784
Bring up again

756
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,368
Medtronic which makes insulin pumps

757
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,392
They have

758
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,696
Some older models that are still in use

759
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,488
My people that

760
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,304
Essentially can easily be hacked

761
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
And

762
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,608
Medtronic hainan

763
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,912
Left it off and then say it's a big deal

764
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,936
So

765
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
Two researchers actually

766
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:25,056
Build an Android app to prove it is a problem

767
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:29,152
Basic saying hey this app we know that we reverse-engineer the frequency

768
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,480
To the Medtronic pump and we can send it commands to

769
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:37,344
Shut up somebody's insulin Spike their insulin or whatever we could kill somebody

770
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,440
They did this to Spur Medtronic to do exactly what Medtronic has finally done

771
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,768
They've issued a recall and they're going to replace those pumps which is great

772
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,560
I'm not surprised by this because

773
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,864
I actually I know the frequency

774
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
For that because I thought

775
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,680
A radio

776
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:56,032
Hat for Raspberry Pi to send commands to electronic but we used it for good

777
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
To help

778
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,616
Automatically regulate insulin based on

779
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,176
Blood sugar readings for RCS class so

780
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,736
Good on these guys more white hats

781
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,040
Showing that these things need to be resolved

782
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,624
Yes and initially it would be awesome if these things

783
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,392
Kingston happening

784
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
We're getting

785
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,560
Okay I think now it is time for The Internet of Things

786
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Podcast

787
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352

Who is it

812
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,504
It's Steve Steve alright this week's color is Steve who has a pressing question that I imagine a lot of us have

813
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
Let's hear it

814
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
Hey guys my name is

815
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,416
Steve Zahn from Dallas Texas I was recently outside

816
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,232
Grilling and I had an idea that it was

817
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
The Great

818
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
Anime

819
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
Type object

820
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
2

821
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,632
Do communication between

822
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,192
Devices I already have which include

823
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,216
Show

824
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,008
Couple.

825
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,544
And a regular Echo

826
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,848
And have something outside

827
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,176
I in order to play music and communicate with my wife

828
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:43,040
Any suggestions or ideas you might have would be great leap

829
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
Thank you

830
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
Okay Steve

831
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
We have

832
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
Pretty much bad

833
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,304
The particular use case you're looking for the drop in

834
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,632
That is only something that can be found on Amazon

835
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,656
Echo devices

836
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:03,008
Does third-party third-party outdoor capable speaker

837
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,288
Is it going to work

838
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
For this

839
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
Sorry

840
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
But

841
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,664
You can buy at a third party

842
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,456
Outdoor capable speaker in

843
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
Plug the Amazon

844
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
Input

845
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,320
Intuit this is a $35 device

846
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:20,160
You will have to plug it in using the 3.5 L

847
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
Your headphone jack

848
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
So

849
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,744
Using that cable

850
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
Plug that in

851
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,328
You're also going to have to plug it into power

852
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,144
And you probably shouldn't leave it outside

853
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,448
So what is awesome

854
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Not right now

855
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,824
But if you can live without the calling in the drop-in

856
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,944
I didn't know this until just this morning you could get a Madam a speaker

857
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,552
For outdoors that's water-resistant and dust-resistant IP67 rated

858
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,624
Ultimate Ears makes the blast which is a small

859
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,208
Battery powered Wi-Fi and Bluetooth speaker with Madame a built-in

860
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,536
Again because it's third-party you can't use the calling in the drop-in

861
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,816
But at least you could

862
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:02,144
You listen to music outside change it by voice and so on so forth

863
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,752
And I'm even wondering maybe there's some skills out there or you could use if this the naturally

864
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,336
Send a text message to the family there might be a way to do it but

865
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:14,176
Needily that's not going to work for the eagle with the Ultimate Ears blast

866
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
You can just bring your smartphone outside

867
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,808
I know that's true that's not it

868
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
It's not exciting

869
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
But

870
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
Do you really have to have dropped

871
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,000
Good-news-bad-news

872
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:32,608
Couple options I also looked for outdoor enclosures for the Amazon Echo devices

873
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,656
I didn't find anything

874
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
That was for

875
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,472
Sorry Steve

876
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,776
I feel like you're trying failed you

877
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
It's not us

878
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
Amazon

879
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,408
Maybe it'll make an outdoor speaker I imagine the reason it doesn't

880
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,456
Is because it doesn't want to give flake

881
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,992
Controller something

882
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
To somebody walking by 2

883
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,088
Lean over the fence and be like

884
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,184
Unlock the door

885
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,000
Or that's what voice matches for that's why I work so well

886
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,328
Maybe maybe it's a call Voice match but

887
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
Oh I was

888
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
I thought that was Google but yes

889
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,192
Guess you could do that but

890
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,752
Be aware that if you leave one of these outside

891
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,288
You are opening up

892
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,104
A whole world of excitement to mischievous Neighbors

893
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,896
Who know you have

894
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Already

895
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,528
That concludes this portion of the show please

896
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,088
Stay tuned for our interview with

897
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,880
Rags srinivasan

898
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
Who is from

899
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,976
Seagate talking about project

900
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:35,584
Bina and how they helped improve their manufacturing process using

901
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,888
Iot and AI

902
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
Before that

903
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,472
Let's hear from our sponsor

904
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:45,056
District sponsor is Dell Technologies

905
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:51,456
Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from Mars

906
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,528
Sponsor sponsor is Dell Technologies

907
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,552
And I have

908
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
Craig Wetzel

909
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,136
Who is director of iot channels

910
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
Intel

911
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,464
Here to talk to you about their relationship

912
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
With gel

913
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:08,096
So what is on the horizon for Intel in the iot space and how do you see Dell engaging

914
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,120
Tell to bring that

915
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:13,472
Industries that are seen the greatest benefits from iot and Edge computing

916
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,776
Enabled IAAI includes Healthcare

917
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
Manufacturing

918
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
Retail

919
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,104
And smart cities

920
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
Take retail for example

921
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:27,296
We see an interesting future in this area of interactive retail and had quite a few engagements in the retail Market

922
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:31,904
Together we're exploring ways that we can turn those traditional retail interactions

923
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,952
It's more unique retail experiences

924
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,000
We're doing this by leveraging

925
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,048
The latest computer vision technology

926
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:44,448
Instrumental such as the openvino toolkit which stands for open visual inference and neural network optimization

927
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,008
This toolkit allows for developers to innovate

928
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,800
Deep learning inference at the edge

929
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,616
So weird the point across the different solutions and platforms

930
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
Blockers

931
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,920
Let me give you an example

932
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
Imagine if a shopper

933
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:59,296
To go to a retail location and a retailer could use various iot

934
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
Technology

935
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
Identify that shopper

936
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
Personalize their shopping

937
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:08,512
The retail will be able to allow customer to set up a shopping profile they could be accessed

938
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,536
Window Shopper in

939
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,072
Stores video

940
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:15,168
To be used to identify that Shoppers they entered and begin an interactive engagement

941
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,728
Is that retailer for Sadie's a clothing store

942
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,776
That history could include the shoppers

943
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
Clothing sizes

944
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,824
Favorite colors

945
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,592
Branford

946
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,872
An accessory

947
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,432
They could then use this digital signage

948
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,712
The guy The Shopper

949
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
What's the area of the store

950
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,272
What do you have the most interest

951
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,320
Use the interactive mirror

952
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,368
To show the clothing in different colors

953
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,928
Then you lies a real-time inventory

954
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,232
Deliver the chosen item to the shoppers home

955
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,024
If the item they want is out of stock

956
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
They can have it delivered to their home

957
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,120
Taking these types of Analytics

958
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,912
Can revolutionize a traditional

959
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,704
And bring a better process

960
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,080
These types of solutions are easy to install with the breadth of products that Dell offer

961
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,152
From their servers to their Dell Edge Gateway

962
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
Vicki Craig

963
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,992
Any final thoughts or observations you'd lie

964
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,552
In regards to the Internet of Things

965
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,856
Iot is not an easy

966
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,160
It requires multiple products

967
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,440
Woven together

968
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
With the right app

969
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,048
Applications installed in locations that are in many times challenging

970
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,096
No one company

971
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
Can do it alone

972
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,656
Dell Intel together

973
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,936
What are strong

974
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,776
Are developing into Point Solutions across Industries in Dragonsreach

975
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:30,432

Everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

982
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,800
Rags srinivasan

983
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,824
Who is

984
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,104
Senior director

985
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,408
Roads verticals at Seagate

986
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,944
Rags how are you

987
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,016
ICC I'm doing very well how are you doing

988
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,832
I am super well and I'm really excited

989
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
Because

990
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:14,720
We met a couple months ago and you talk to me about bringing AI into

991
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
Your Manufacturing

992
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,536
The Wayfarer menu

993
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,840
We'll talk a little bit about

994
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,680
What that entails and the choices that you made around

995
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,472
Iot and AI

996
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,264
In your business operations

997
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,152
First. Explain to people most people know what Seagate does

998
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,712
But you may want to explain a little bit about

999
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,272
How you do it and why you guys decided to

1000
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
To update your mail

1001
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,208
The most people Noah's from the diet most people run into me in the street say I saw your advice that the cost

1002
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,000
It's it's that's all they know us

1003
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,280
Baltimore Drive

1004
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:55,680
Run most of the Claudia Sanchez everywhere like we could use about tens of millions of fives at Porter

1005
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,496
Caleb would be a Manufacturing

1006
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,544
Otis technology company

1007
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,592
A lot of manufacturing behind

1008
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:07,712
To produce 30 + million units of guys every quarter and make sure the war

1009
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,272
Black inside the driveway

1010
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,576
Truly and engineering

1011
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,904
Ikeda's multiple pliers and drive it

1012
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,280
All bags in such a small form-factor is like a drive head

1013
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,816
Floating over

1014
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,096
Spinning platter

1015
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,912
Delete coolant all like a 747

1016
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
Flying seven

1017
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,240
Times the speed of sound

1018
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
Close to the ground

1019
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,312
So it is every bit of it is

1020
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,360
Complex and high position matters

1021
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:39,200
On anything we can do there to improve the process

1022
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,736
Improve depression

1023
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
All the quality

1024
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,344
Is going to have a direct impact on a business

1025
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,744
So that's why we decided to take a careful look at our retirement election process I'm take advantage of

1026
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
Coyote mint

1027
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,560
So what you guys decided to

1028
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,584
Upgrade your manufacturer

1029
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,168
Check process what was your first Insider what was your first

1030
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:03,776
When we started out we started like most people be

1031
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,616
Got in the room and started talking technology first

1032
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:14,016
But we looked at the iot sensors we looked at our entire manufacturing process that Got7 Factory

1033
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,320
The central machinery

1034
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:21,696
I got excited by what we see and hear about happening in the AI instead of there

1035
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,512
Very quickly recognized

1036
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:30,144
Everything that we do our Starwood technology is not the direct

1037
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
Answered

1038
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,984
Do what we want to solve intensive business and back

1039
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
Although

1040
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
All these projects

1041
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,640
You can start off bite off much bigger than you could going to begin with

1042
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,968
So we also needed to scale a CO2 emissions

1043
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:50,368
Every bit of the cycle you can put them in categorization DHS simple

1044
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,440
Manufacturing product inventions project

1045
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:58,560
It could be a quality improvement process where is it we want to start

1046
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,656
Reasonably hard enough but others I'm not done it

1047
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:06,752
As well as solving it will have a direct business impact

1048
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,848
Narrow down the public space to pick that one aspect

1049
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
Drive

1050
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,664
Head quality

1051
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,272
In the whole chain drive had manufacturing process has aborted.

1052
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,320
Takes 6 months to complete

1053
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:27,744
Solving. One with a I and II RT will give us the biggest energy of wind that we wanted

1054
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,584
And then from that scale back to the rest of the processes

1055
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,400
Awesome

1056
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,704
You guys basically said hey

1057
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,824
We could like do this low-hanging predictive maintenance on our machines and maybe make our factories

1058
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
Perform a little bit more efficiently

1059
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
Or

1060
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
We could go big

1061
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,712
And say hey we're going to take this

1062
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,040
Really intricate process and see how we can improve it

1063
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,320
And that's hopefully have

1064
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,088
Away Barrett

1065
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,208
That is exactly correct focus on the outcomes more

1066
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:03,840
If you look at that the commercial that has seen better salesman coming out before that everybody's dogs

1067
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:10,240
Everyone's imagination very quickly but what really matters is if you go down to the real heart number

1068
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:16,384
Please like if I can predict a particular entity that we're making is going to be flawed

1069
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,944
Before we go to the 1400 steps

1070
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,344
Stop flow directly into our body

1071
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,232
Outside to tell a bigger story but he has a great comeback so that's where we roll back and start it there and yes

1072
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,840
It will be a big enough problem for us to take on Unsolved

1073
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:39,168
That's a really good thing I mean yes no I don't think anyone

1074
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:44,800
Is like yes I want to make spinning platters and the heads that read those more efficient

1075
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
The number one problem facing

1076
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,384
Production line but for you

1077
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
It makes sense

1078
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:49,920
So

1079
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
How much is that per

1080
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,760
Just getting to it like figuring out

1081
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,040
What you guys were going

1082
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
What did you learn

1083
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:04,000
Twisted our initial setup brainstorming analysis

1084
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:10,400
Problems faced reduction if you will

1085
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:15,008
We wanted to do a lot of things we have very qualified very smart Buy

1086
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,544
Wanted to try a few things

1087
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:23,456
What you brought in this like I got involved with the tmb put it more of a structure around

1088
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:29,856
Games focus on the priorities ourselves of more aggressive gold starting from the point to do

1089
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,880
One thing

1090
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,672
Promise to

1091
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,208
How much bigger

1092
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,536
Across-the-board going to do it for one Factory

1093
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
One Pilot

1094
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:45,216
And then from there I have a plan how am I going to scale that from that one line one Factory do 7

1095
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,496
Other taxis worldwide

1096
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,544
And the first thing also we did it

1097
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,943
Branded the project first easier to going in there and say like I'm going to do it

1098
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,735
Turn everything but after that abuses

1099
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,807
Internal organizational attachment

1100
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:04,159
We branded the Catalyst project Athena

1101
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,439
That helped us

1102
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:11,839
Create a rallying cry around the entire organization we got the name out in front of the execs we got the

1103
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,631
Exact Pi in to do this

1104
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,447
How do you saw that everyone riding around let's

1105
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,543
Let's all work together to make project Athena SX

1106
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:24,895
Everyone was able to Define

1107
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
What's part of it

1108
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,503
Decided that this is about anomaly detection

1109
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:34,111
Braverman factoring from the way of the papers. Cut into head

1110
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,719
Illegally this is about delivering the quality improvement improvement

1111
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,791
Reduction in the need for future Investments

1112
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:46,911
Keymander the one common umbrella and then everyone started speaking the language

1113
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,935
Gateway

1114
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,751
Enough of momentum that is needed to get going

1115
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:57,151
I'm from the completion it was about 12-15 months or so to complete the pilot

1116
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,711
The process of taking this

1117
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:05,855
And then how you can become scalable and Deployable in a way it's easier without the

1118
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,671
Same level of Steven Waldman Insanity Factory

1119
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,951
Sisters VR app

1120
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
Okay

1121
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:15,071
So let's talk about what you guys learned initially with project

1122
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,863
Athena you started out

1123
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,655
You were using cameras

1124
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,703
Brett to analyze the

1125
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,983
Defects in

1126
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
Wafers

1127
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:29,151
And let's see there was like 10 I think was 10 terabytes of data add a 17 million photos there's there's a lot

1128
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,431
That was happening so

1129
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,479
Talk to me exactly about

1130
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,015
What you guys did

1131
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,295
And even how

1132
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,087
Cute Ranger neural network to

1133
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,367
Analyze the state

1134
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:42,975
Listen to Parts I make sure I'll hit the second tiny parts

1135
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
Basketball

1136
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,559
TriStar you got the numbers right in there so

1137
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,583
This is.

1138
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,399
17 million images just for that one process

1139
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,727
Where we talked with us 200 nanometer wafers

1140
00:43:53,983 --> 00:44:00,127
And then to let the 49ers stuff we cut them into multiple sliders that are then stacked into

1141
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,455
I would go into the desk

1142
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,479
Assembly there

1143
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:09,855
There are multiple stages where we have

1144
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,183
Electron microscopes located that take pictures

1145
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:19,583
Today in some of these parts as well he's analyzed by the human operators the experts

1146
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,375
For anomalies

1147
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:25,727
But we have complemented this with certain level of Rude by AJR

1148
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:29,823
You go on to write down

1149
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,127
All the known anomalies

1150
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,431
What it looks like I fired

1151
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,391
Operator gets in wall

1152
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:49,791
Even if we were asking our operators to make coasters

1153
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,839
Way too complicated

1154
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,703
The problem says the anomalies are not fixed

1155
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:01,823
We can't codify everything changes over time out of gross as well

1156
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639
Created a real

1157
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,967
Ideal space where we can apply machine learning

1158
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,527
Let it learn the anomaly patterns

1159
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,343
I didn't continue to claim that every 3 months

1160
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,623
Spell the patterns change

1161
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,927
So the model is always up-to-date

1162
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,719
For us to use it

1163
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,999
A better way

1164
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,047
Do you make those predictions

1165
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,167
What would be the New Orleans are there

1166
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:31,519
If you take the image classification there are many models are there

1167
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,847
We are using one of the standard image classification models there

1168
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,967
But we did about 30 different zomato to see which one works

1169
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:45,599
Spellforce

1170
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,927
Remodeled has about 20 + layers

1171
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:55,327
I need to find out the pixel level

1172
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,143
Ridges in at 6:11 and be able to say if it's a defect

1173
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
Or not

1174
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,447
Does that allows

1175
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:06,847
To find it a very high level of accuracy whether a particular way for has an anomaly or not

1176
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,895
A weak acid

1177
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,991
We stopped us from going through the process being made into dryvit

1178
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:16,319
Which failed or worse

1179
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:20,927
The customer side which is data management all those things

1180
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,743
So we helped to avoid all the things

1181
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,559
By finding those defects

1182
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,375
Much much earlier in the production process.

1183
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
Got it

1184
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,727
Yay finding defects early as is

1185
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,311
So what is the underlying architecture that you using

1186
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,591
Because I

1187
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,127
I think that's a lot of data

1188
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
It's happening in real time

1189
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,991
I don't know how fast your Wafers come off the manufacturing

1190
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,575
For that particular process but it seems like

1191
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,623
There's a lot of data processing

1192
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,207
Edge so what is it that you're using what are you calculating

1193
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:02,143
We are processing things like 1 billion x uses tens of millions of guys 1/4

1194
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,703
We actually wanted to focus on process

1195
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
Much much earlier

1196
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:11,103
Rather than trying to improve down the chain quality improvement process

1197
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,895
So we have looked at

1198
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,735
It's 17 million are so images. Coming through

1199
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:23,903
WeChat label all supervised learning when you go it depends on

1200
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,183
Someone looking at

1201
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:29,535
All images trying to label them say this is a good one this is a bad one

1202
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,351
Stop possible to onexton we can do that

1203
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,423
So we devised our own internal algorithm

1204
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,703
But can't look at

1205
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,007
These images

1206
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:44,127
Are segmentation off them cuz this could be in The Bachelor this could be in the other set

1207
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,431
Other music human interpretation

1208
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:50,015
Do you stumble a sampling from it to say is this correct

1209
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,087
Labeling algorithm

1210
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
Can be corrected

1211
00:47:55,647 --> 00:48:01,791
I hate running in the Free Loop there once we have it kind of training day. We were able to build out

1212
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:08,447
A Chooser process with the training like they're on the edge because 10 terabytes of data per day is not

1213
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,495
Something we can head over to the cloud

1214
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:15,615
Inference that happens quite there on the manufacturing line

1215
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:19,199
Good morning about 20 or so decisions per second

1216
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:25,855
What's the sauce is good food to make which river is good in between fridge not bad and do so at a high level of confidence

1217
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,671
So we can end up with a much better quality there

1218
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:33,791
It sounds like you have done a lot of the work already that a lot of companies are trying to

1219
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,071
You're out so

1220
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,631
How did you set this up was it easy

1221
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,423
Did you have to hire in

1222
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,703
Experts to

1223
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,983
Create this platform

1224
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:46,591
If there existed an off-the-shelf solution

1225
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:52,991
13 /

1226
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,807
People who wanted to solve the problem not just

1227
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:00,671
Let me go and invented a game here mentality but when we looked outside something that takes

1228
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,791
And use it to solve anomaly detection there was none existed

1229
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:12,191
So we brought into HP Park as a partner

1230
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,215
Two main exports

1231
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:19,615
With a good understanding of how the machine learning and deifies worth

1232
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:25,503
I'm having deployed in a similar scale but something else

1233
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,319
Together the team help develop an architecture

1234
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:33,183
An easier orchestration where the model gets trained

1235
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
Correctly

1236
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,511
Homologous deploy easily

1237
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,791
Orange red

1238
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:44,191
Alan you have a way to retrain them all ugly deployed over the pier is not just one and done

1239
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,239
Take me to work continuously

1240
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,567
So that helped us having HPV as a partner

1241
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,847
We need help.

1242
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
Build

1243
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:55,967
Amore maintainable solution that grows or the time

1244
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,415
Existed

1245
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:10,815
So we wanted to Cheryl experience as well that's one of the reasons why we go to lightsaber defining or problems

1246
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,863
Architecture

1247
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:19,263
Weed and applying to different architectures the one we usually built out with HP

1248
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,591
The one is without the hitch.

1249
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:26,431
We did with the dgx the big one from Nvidia

1250
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:29,759
And use that as a parallel architecture to test this will knock

1251
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,807
How does architecture work

1252
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:38,207
One you end up with a lot more then in our case than what we needed but both of those definitely would work

1253
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,511
For anyone wanting to build

1254
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,791
Image-based

1255
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,839
Spell isolation in the factory

1256
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:49,983
Different from iot but I'll say this

1257
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,263
The most

1258
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:54,847
Pulisic IAT sensor that is out there is a camera lens

1259
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,895
I'm getting stressed out thinking about those

1260
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,455
Camera first use cases lochmoor

1261
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:02,783
I'm just looking at say a few sensors here and there

1262
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:06,879
A camera captured so much more information that is which

1263
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:10,463
I need to work in ways that we did not even think of

1264
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,511
That is true

1265
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,791
Totally on board with

1266
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,327
The camera being the most important

1267
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,631
Center especially in things like Manufacturing

1268
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,167
Industrial

1269
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
Applications

1270
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,983
Obviously it's awesome and Holmes 2

1271
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,263
But I have

1272
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,031
Issues with

1273
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
Everyone's home

1274
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,359
Let's go into

1275
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:30,943
You've obviously done this you guys did a little bit faster than I thought

1276
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,991
3 months getting into it and then

1277
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,295
12215 actually implementing it

1278
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,623
Until your next step is to bring this to all 7 of your Manufacturing

1279
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,159
Plantain and maybe

1280
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,719
Doing some additional use cases

1281
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
Talk to me about the next day

1282
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,839
Able to achieve

1283
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,631
Because of Define

1284
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:54,751
Are goals clearly to one process one aspect

1285
00:51:55,007 --> 00:52:01,151
Elevate my entire Factory every part of it into smart manufacturing lights

1286
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,175
One line

1287
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:08,575
So that helped as well so we do not deviate we did not try to add on one thing or the other

1288
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:14,975
Casas Renta long so we focus on one thing

1289
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:19,583
Is we have a timeline we want to take this one and then replicated and 7UP

1290
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:25,983
This requires a bit of packaging with any of those projects anything else you do

1291
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:32,895
We all focus on solving the problem not about shipping it or not about how other people use it like so weird

1292
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,455
Making sure the second aspects come through

1293
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,783
Where is this becomes more of a package solution

1294
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,855
How are teams can ticket deployed across

1295
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,391
Please have another factories there

1296
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:50,559
