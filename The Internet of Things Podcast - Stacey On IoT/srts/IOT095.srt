00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,288
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host

2
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,848
Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,176
And we have got an amazing show for

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:18,944
Are you today

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,224
We have

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,504
New Raspberry Pi

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,832
We got a new smart home plan from Telstra Australia

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,880
We've got home for Sonos

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
We've got

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,952
The future of retail

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,744
We're going to save some right

13
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:38,144
And if we get to it we will talk about my experience with stringify

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,168
Which is a

15
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
Really

16
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,984
How cool it's like it if this then that

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,800
They're going to hate me for saying it but that's what it does

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,896
We also have a sponsored message from

19
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
Cast an amazing guest

20
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,224
We have three amazing guess

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,248
I went to an event

22
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,856
National instruments and I managed to run into the CEO of PTC

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,160
The CEO of NRA

24
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
Alex Devereux

25
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,208
And

26
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:08,096
Their head of embedded systems Jamie Smith all of them are coming on the show this week to talk about

27
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,400
What is going on in the industrial

28
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,424
Internet of Things

29
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
No

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
Let's go to a quick sponsor message

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
This week sponsor

32
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,384
That's right you guys I don't have a sponsor this week

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,784
But I decided to use the spot to tell you about two things one if you would like to be a sponsor the space

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,184
You should email Andrew at Coyote podcast.com into if you can't get a

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,584
Enough internet of things news for me here you should sign up for my newsletter Stacey on iot.

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,400
It's also my brand new website

37
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:47,264
And sometimes I might surprise you by putting up new content there.

38
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:53,408
If you want more go there go to Stacey on iot, and if you want to advertise

39
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
Email Andrew

40
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,224
Iot podcast

41
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
All right I think that's it

42
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
How is my 32nd

43
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,136
Back to the show

44
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Kevin

45
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,464
Weather

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's kick it off with

47
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
Hi

48
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,608
I love pies restaurants Raspberry Pi

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
Yeah

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,240
So they got a new compute module is this is the

51
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,032
Third instance of it I believe

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
I almost feel like it's

53
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,384
No cuz they have raspberry they have the original

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
They have one that's better

55
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
And then they have the zero

56
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
It's like

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
V bucks

58
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
And now they have

59
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
The superpower

60
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,880
Right okay so this is that they're calling the compute module

61
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,696
3 which is based on the the latest

62
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,744
Raspberry Pi the pi 3

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,328
And what the promising is even though it's all the same

64
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:48,448
Broadcom 2837 processor

65
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,592
It is double the RAM and about 10 times CP performance of the original computer module which was

66
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,408
2014, three years ago

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
And before the show States I eat you and I were talking like

68
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,832
Does a Raspberry Pi as in a compute module does it need more

69
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,672
Power if it's going to be safer IRT maybe a person like that

70
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
Right now maybe not

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,304
But you raised a good point they're trying to stay

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
I think because

73
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
As

74
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
We add more devices to our homes

75
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
It takes more time to compute what needs to happen all the little steps to turn things on turn things off or adjust based on

76
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Uncensored

77
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
So

78
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,712
You know at first I was like I don't really see the point is but based on your thought

79
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,760
Makes sense it makes sense to stay ahead of the Curve

80
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
Yeah I think

81
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,064
You're going to buy a hub

82
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Probably

83
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,952
Every two to three years and for those of us who are shocked you like

84
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,792
I don't know you're not no it's it's a computer

85
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
You wouldn't die if you see

86
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Expected to last

87
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
I think this makes sense

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,240
I also think if we're going to do more local compute

89
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
For your house it also makes sense for that

90
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
In this is actually really

91
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,920
Good use case for like the type of arm

92
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:07,040
Chips that are out there cuz these are very small workloads that are going to come in kind of all at once

93
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
And you're going to want to parse them up if you can

94
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
I'm not saying

95
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
Maybe we should have a

96
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
I don't know

97
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
Or multi-core

98
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,512
That's kind of my thinking he

99
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,327
So yeah I'm excited about this Plus

100
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
There's such a

101
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,935
Huge number of people out there building crazy stuff with pies

102
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,543
And no one no one in the history of the world has ever said I need less

103
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,383
Right right pricing is not bad at all

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,967
$20 for the compute module 3 they have

105
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,783
A lighter version for $25 so

106
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,599
You know if you just want to Tinker around

107
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
How to build your own Hub you some

108
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:50,047
Michelle software open source software

109
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,119
And that's that's a beauty the Raspberry Pi always has been and I hope they stick

110
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,143
And

111
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
Just so you know

112
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
The compute module is

113
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,055
Drop-in replacement for the first

114
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,639
Incompatible

115
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
Gosh this

116
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
Raspberry Pi print server

117
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
Can you make a pie Sprint soccer actually

118
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,807
I did

119
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,671
It doesn't make sounds

120
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,975
Alright so

121
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Yay pie

122
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
Moving right along

123
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
2

124
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
This is some fun

125
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,911
News for me because I own six of these

126
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,471
And I have been very frustrated

127
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:35,615
But Sonos actually last week and we didn't address it on the show John McFarlane the CEO of Sonos

128
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
Step down

129
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,455
Replace with Patrick spens

130
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
Has been working at Sonos for a while

131
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
Is

132
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,807
This felt very much like

133
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,439
Great move for Sonos I mean

134
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,255
He basically he kind of missed the boat on

135
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
Voice and soda

136
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,607
Putting Sonos in the position of being not just the

137
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,423
Speakers for the entire car

138
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
Make it home

139
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
But also

140
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
The ears

141
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,031
Instead

142
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,871
Amazon created the Amazon Echo and boom they took that

143
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
In

144
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
For what it's worth

145
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
Sonos is still a great

146
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,759
I'm actually holding onto my Sonos is

147
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,319
Cousin sometime this year they're supposed to start work

148
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
Fingers crossed

149
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
But Patrick spens

150
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
Is really up

151
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
The Voice

152
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
He is like

153
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,911
We are doing it we are not going to do it ourselves we are going to work with others Sonos has always been really good at playing it

154
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Ecosystem

155
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,519
It originally came out with like this vision of being like

156
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:42,431
We want to be the best darn internet-connected speaker ever so they never tried to launch their own music service to compete with other

157
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,503
Mother's Day just wanted to make all of your existing Music Services

158
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
So

159
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
Hopefully that's the tact

160
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,159
They take invoice I think they actually could have done their own

161
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
Voice thing but now it's

162
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
Too late

163
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
So

164
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
You know we'll see if it's

165
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
The way forward for them I guess

166
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,983
Yeah I wonder I mean it doesn't make sense for them to kind of create their own voice interface when there are options out there

167
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,335
And my daughter have been talking to Amazon and payment amounts anything

168
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,663
That may be the way to go to use the

169
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
Voice services from from Amazon

170
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:22,367
And it's kind of interesting yet I don't know if you caught this news or do we talked about it last week that Huawei actually has a phone with

171
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,439
Amazon voice services in it Prince all is well

172
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,791
That's why people are starting to do now just climb onto what's already available in working well

173
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
That's true in

174
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,911
Way back in the day cuz Sonos launch super early

175
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,239
They actually had like a $300 controller

176
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
You bought two controllers

177
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
Smartphones

178
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Wait a second

179
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:49,759
People in app because that $300 controller while revenue for us is also a huge barrier to entry

180
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
In Dallas

181
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,927
Patrick Spence actually said that Sonos were in 20% of American households which

182
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
It's a lot

183
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
So

184
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,839
I think we can expect good things here

185
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,167
I am ultimately a little sad that they missed the boat

186
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
Last year on this but you know

187
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:15,615
There's still time in the got such a broad user base it's so you know I'm not saying it's easy but essentially integrates Employee Services

188
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
You've got a

189
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,735
Hannah people you know that I'm much happier now and then

190
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,807
Less likely to leave for different connected speakers

191
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,415
Cuz like actually ditch

192
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
Best Bluetooth speaker

193
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,815
High quality Marshall

194
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,887
Stanmore Bluetooth speaker we talkin about

195
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
I just

196
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Bluetooth speakers

197
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,751
This is one of our

198
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
The Fight Continues

199
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,199
This is a quick bit too quick fix for you

200
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
One is Telstra

201
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
We're going to go International for a moment

202
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
HealthStream which is an Australian carrier

203
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,671
Is getting into the smartphone business much like Comcast or AT&T is done

204
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,255
They've created a service that's going to cost $25

205
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
25 Australian dollars

206
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,607
And you basically will get a starter kit

207
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,191
One for either security or one for automation energy

208
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
Take out their own hub

209
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,311
It's pretty much like what you would expect from other people

210
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
Like other carriers

211
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,407
I mention this mostly because

212
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
I do think

213
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,759
This year we're going to see a lot more carriers come out

214
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
With the sort of offering

215
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
And I think it's

216
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
A probable way

217
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,951
For smart home devices to get mainstream

218
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
One because it's easier

219
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
And people love easy

220
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,191
You're going to feel more secure with it and you're going to feel like most of your devices are going to be free

221
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,031
Those are some of the worries that

222
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
Customers have

223
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,383
Those are valid concerns

224
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,455
It's interesting you mention security and I know that

225
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Last year

226
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:02,623
Telstra talking about using blockchain and biometric security for their iot stuff so

227
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
You know they're not

228
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:10,303
Fiddling around here in just putting products out there not thinking about the one of the most important aspects that we talked about all the time or just security so

229
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
At least they're they're thinking forward in that respect

230
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,935
They are and they're one of the companies that it CES

231
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,751
Add a smart home suite of products out on display

232
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
This is probably

233
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,383
Good I don't know who makes telstra's gear

234
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,015
These are the kind of things that I'm going to be looking for is to or the providers to the

235
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,319
Terriers and security firms

236
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Chinese

237
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
Are they startups

238
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:41,279
Which startups are actually good enough to make it into these systems or being good enough

239
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,119
Question of some control

240
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
These are things that are

241
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
This this year is going to be a big

242
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
For iot

243
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
In this function

244
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Keep an eye on it

245
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Ok

246
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
Also international news

247
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Nest

248
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
Has God for more European

249
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Countries

250
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
They are now in

251
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Germany

252
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
Austria Italy

253
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
In spades

254
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
They're already in the UK

255
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,951
And basically this just

256
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
Pushes them out

257
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
Further into

258
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:20,191
I wonder that end I'll just say yes this is part of alphabet which one's Google and I

259
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
Nashville time

260
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,519
Consult for Google so I can get that out of the way

261
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
I wonder what

262
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:30,943
Has taken so long as you think it's privacy laws in those countries that need to be mitigated or

263
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
I'm so glad you are

264
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,551
Fat look at that it's not even on the show

265
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
And I just asked the right question

266
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Yuan

267
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
That's why you're the host

268
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
Arco home

269
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
All right

270
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,511
So I think one of the issues here

271
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Where is

272
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
Regulatory

273
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,143
Not just privacy but also

274
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,935
Getting things through the

275
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,983
Different countries versions of the FCC

276
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:59,359
And the reason this is kind of interesting to me is because when I was at CES I spoke

277
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
With a bunch of

278
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,455
Companies from like the France Tech Pavilion

279
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503
And all that

280
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:12,415
And they were talking about they're not available here in the US the products aren't available in the US but they're working their way through the app

281
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
CC's process

282
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,511
That provides a lot of stumbling

283
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Gymnastics

284
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Is pretty professional

285
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
They're not like a starter

286
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
They probably can get through but

287
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
These things take time

288
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
And so

289
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
I don't know what this is

290
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,127
Good bad buddy wants a lot of interference jacking up their existing system so I tend to agree that it's good

291
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
But

292
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
That regulatory hurdle can take

293
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:41,599
Obviously not like Hardware Supply there's plenty of those products being billed as just getting through to like you

294
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:46,463
Correct spelling of the regulatory agencies that are specific to each country

295
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,559
And I can't say I'm up on the latest frequencies The Clash over

296
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,863
Yogurt making me use I don't know

297
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
If there's something that

298
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,495
A typical Nest product uses that interferes with an everyday thing over there but

299
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
Still seems like a long time

300
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,383
Does an end you know they also have to hire

301
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,175
Company-specific support

302
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,015
If you're in Italy you probably don't do your customer support

303
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,343
PriceRite localization care

304
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
So

305
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
Challenges

306
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
This is a market

307
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:25,887
Where you're going to have to have a fairly large Footprints so you're probably going to want to go to places

308
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
Where you can

309
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
Build up your bar kit

310
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,775
Easily and quickly so that means smaller countries

311
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
May miss out on some products from startups

312
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
Eddie House

313
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
Moving right along

314
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
Let's move from International

315
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
2

316
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
Enterprise iot

317
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,623
What we have here is this week is NRF National Retail Federation

318
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,183
Conference event

319
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,023
They called The Big Show the NRF Big Show cuz I was there yesterday at it

320
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Did you see anything

321
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,495
I didn't have a lot of time I did see a lot of I did see a lot of exciting things interesting no retailers

322
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,055
They're looking for ways to be in a booster

323
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,871
Foot traffic in stores looking for ways to

324
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,663
What do we attract customers

325
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,199
Where they are in the store

326
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,783
How much engagement they have with a particular product or aisle

327
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,831
Even emotions

328
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,111
Cameras that will

329
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
Take a look at customer spaces and try and

330
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
Determine

331
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:26,303
How happy were disappointing people are in products or displays it

332
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,863
There's a lot of stuff going on there you wouldn't sink

333
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,959
Retail is glitzy in that respect but there's a lot going on Beyond the Sea

334
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
Use the word glitzy there

335
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
Retail is glitzy

336
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,551
What we actually what was interesting here is the keynote for the NRF

337
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,647
Event was Brian krzanich the CEO of Intel

338
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,999
A hundred million dollars

339
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Investing in retail

340
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
They also announced basically

341
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
It's a gateway

342
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
It's a Gateway lots of words but they all come down to this it's a Gateway it's a gateway

343
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,407
But the Gateway run software and idea of the software is Intel's trying to link these

344
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,759
Just for it retail systems into one intel-powered

345
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Platform

346
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Compute inform

347
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
Right now you might have

348
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,207
You know what Appliance or device that measures emotion

349
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,255
And you

350
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
That goes into 1

351
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,351
Place and then if you want that you got to go to that one

352
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,911
One place until trying to do is bring

353
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
The emotion track

354
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,775
The inventory tracking all of this into one platform

355
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,823
Support fraud

356
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
DIY spaces

357
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,895
I saw a lot of

358
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
Plays at that a lot of

359
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
Black puppies trying to

360
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,783
Bring cohesive solutions to

361
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,623
Manage and analyze all the data that these disparate systems

362
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
Capture

363
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,695
So that was a big theme I thought at the show

364
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,487
And that'll be a big scene

365
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,511
For everyone

366
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
Probably till the end of time

367
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
Cuz

368
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
A lot of

369
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
These systems right now

370
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
Are silos

371
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,215
Solutions

372
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,383
If I appoint device and then you're like oh no I want to get together with these guys have been

373
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
So

374
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
This is going to be

375
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
Increasingly important as

376
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
Retailers are

377
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,343
They're shutting down locations there

378
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,903
Having to really boost

379
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
The amount of money they make

380
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
Per square foot

381
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,767
They also are dealing with

382
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
You know hired labor cost

383
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,351
I said I really want to reduce

384
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,631
I'm guessing

385
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,959
But they will say they want to make each employee

386
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,263
Efficient and they can do that

387
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,847
Giving equipping them with more data and insights about the customer

388
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,407
So basically the goal is to make

389
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,967
The retail experience in-store alot

390
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
Higher ed

391
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Mixer

392
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
80%

393
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
House off of Anna

394
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
And it's not because I haven't

395
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
But

396
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,303
It's just easy and I hate to shop

397
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
So

398
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
So

399
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,959
We saw Intel making this announcement I actually talked to zebra

400
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,775
Which is a zebra Technologies it's a

401
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,871
It's well-known for RFID

402
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:24,479
And this one is kind of tied into tracking inventory and tracking

403
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Can customers

404
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,319
So actually they could end up possibly

405
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
Sending data to

406
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
System

407
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,183
This actually has some cool stuff

408
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,231
Because it's RFID tags

409
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,047
In the clothing or in the inventory

410
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
But it's also got these

411
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
Overhead

412
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
So

413
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Right now

414
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,543
A lot of people think of iot in retail and they think of

415
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
Beacons Bluetooth based beacons

416
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,943
But basically in even talking to Intel RFID is still King

417
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:00,831
Because it doesn't need power for one thing it's small can be

418
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,927
Attached to practically anything you know all of your inventory so

419
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:10,047
It just economically make sense I'm not saying it's the best solution but it's one that still work

420
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
Intel also showed off something

421
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,959
Really cool which is a 3D printer for

422
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,751
That was kind of annoying.

423
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,103
My voice but I was really excited it prints

424
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Prince clothing

425
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,943
This is business futuristic

426
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
And I'm really

427
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
Once

428
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:36,927
Retailers have this data am I going to get something crazy like smart mirrors that I look

429
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
I can see my clothes and

430
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
Suggestible things

431
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,791
Or is it going to be a little bit lower key

432
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583
Would like the Apple Store

433
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,959
Play has like a tablet and they just come through and they're like oh I see you're doing this you know

434
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,263
This might also look good on you basically

435
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,503
Football scenarios because some customers want that handheld experience not handheld device

436
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
Not literally but

437
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,391
Store associate to walk them through and have personalized shopping

438
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,719
With assistance and some people just want to

439
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,815
Engage in the product themselves and figure out what's best for them and

440
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,143
And we saw that the smart mirror I think three years ago at CVS where

441
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:23,263
Literally stand in front of it and it would show you wearing different clothes of your choice based on your hitting a button

442
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,359
Superimposing the clothes to see what you look like in some people want that so I think

443
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
Retailers will Embrace both

444
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
I would like that in my home

445
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
Yeah

446
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
Amazon show me what this looks like

447
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,623
Sunday Sunday

448
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Pictures are

449
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
All right

450
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,255
Hey you guys asked for us to talk about the Nvidia Shield

451
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
And I was kind of like

452
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
What

453
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
We can do that

454
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,631
But we can cuz Kevin went out and bought one

455
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Incentive

456
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
Kevin such a sucker

457
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
I forgot it

458
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:59,871
That was the subjects I was going to say that out loud I think we all know

459
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
So tell us about the shield

460
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:07,807
I'm going to start off with something not negative but if I'm going to come out and say if you already have an Nvidia Shield

461
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,111
Shield because this came out 2 years ago originally

462
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,415
You don't need to buy a new Nvidia Shield

463
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
And I say that beat

464
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Cause

465
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,047
Even though Nvidia at CES unveiled a new Shield

466
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,375
It's actually the same internals the new one in the in the old one

467
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
So if you have one

468
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Don't

469
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,751
By 1 about a car to buy a new one because

470
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,335
With a software upgrade you going to get all the features that the new one has

471
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,943
And the reason it didn't really smarter than today I thought the reason didn't upgrade

472
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
They don't need to

473
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,551
The Tegra chip that they have in the original and now the new one again

474
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,623
Has plenty of horsepower to actually

475
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,463
Stream and show 1080p video no problem

476
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,559
4K video no problem 4K HDR video no problem

477
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,399
I don't have any crtv I do have a 4K TV antenna hooked up the shield

478
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,191
And the TV playback.

479
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
Fantastic

480
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,591
Television streaming in the house is done

481
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
I use PlayStation Vue for my

482
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,455
Typical channels in an Amazon Netflix and so on

483
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:12,063
There was coming in 4k in 4k HDR now for Amazon so on so forth so

484
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,855
So from that perspective it's good

485
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
It's

486
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,184
Interesting also because

487
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
A it runs

488
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,280
Android TV the latest version of Android TV

489
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,888
And so it's got built-in voice recognition we talked about that earlier with Sonos

490
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,936
So you can use the remote

491
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,032
Corby game controller and searches by voice

492
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,824
OK Google Now type information

493
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
But the interesting thing from an outie perspective I think

494
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,992
Is that a video said we're going to bring Google Assistant to this

495
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
And

496
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,600
Because you're not always in the same room as your Shield

497
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:51,488
We're going to sell these little $50 plug-in modules that basically are microphones that you put throughout your house

498
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,024
And some people say why

499
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
Always listening

500
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,656
Some people do want that those that do will have access to Google Assistant

501
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,960
3DS little plug-in module

502
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
Really really intelligent

503
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
Real intelligent so

504
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,592
Trent Lott

505
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,640
Eventually if I have

506
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,432
Is more things get connected to

507
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Google home

508
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,736
I could be able to

509
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
How to control it

510
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,784
The Shield

511
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
That is the idea

512
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
Absolutely

513
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,928
Would be no different than having an actual Google home

514
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,232
Hardware device were using your

515
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:28,864
Phone is Google assistant is supported which strain has the pixel and the pixel XL so

516
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:33,728
Yasso

517
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,544
But do the phone version the home version or the

518
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,824
Aloe version

519
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:42,176
Well the phone version is the same as the home version by and large

520
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:49,344
I know there's a there's a couple little things that are different

521
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,392
And then a low as you mentioned

522
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:56,512
Cuz people don't know you can tag Google I can say at Google and any

523
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
Chat with you

524
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Your friends on Allo

525
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,192
And you get the Google Assistant Smart in the conversation so like Stacy if you and I are chatting

526
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,008
And we happen to be in the same city and say it was get some

527
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
Dinner somewhere we can add

528
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,616
At Google not chat say at Google

529
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,456
Find me the closest barbecue restaurant that has 4 stars or better

530
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:20,576
And boom it'll just give us both that information that we have maps and reviews and thoughts

531
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,416
Real quick just in case there's a game around

532
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
They're just in case

533
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,768
The other reason I got I bought the shield is because

534
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
It offers

535
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,864
The Nvidia GeForce now

536
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,680
Subscription for $8 a month first month is free

537
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,984
Where they actually run

538
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,568
Console games on PCS or servers in the cloud and

539
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,616
Stream them to you in real time

540
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,920
No download

541
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,504
So I was playing at 1080p 60 frames per second

542
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,600
Version of Tomb Raider on the shield from Xbox

543
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,696
Indistinguishable between the shield and the Xbox all the difference is

544
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,256
On the shield it's all running in the cloud

545
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
It's neat

546
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,584
The thing is you got up

547
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,376
Here the caveat is

548
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:10,752
That if you're going to stream games from GeForce now at 1080p 60 frames a second

549
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:17,152
They look incredible would you also need an incredible connection for that base a 50 megabits per se

550
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,944
Second is what they recommend

551
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,224
And that's like

552
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,808
Even even with my 150 Meg service here

553
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,880
I occasionally see some

554
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:31,488
Some jagjit and stuff like that going on occasionally

555
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
So

556
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,560
Your mileage may vary

557
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:39,680
Your mileage may vary if it mean if your on something some slow internet don't even think about it

558
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,728
So how much is The Shield

559
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,312
The Shield is 199 which is the same as it was

560
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
A year or two ago

561
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
Debuted

562
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,920
The difference is another smart move

563
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,968
There including the remote and there are

564
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,784
Including the game controller both of which have a microphone

565
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:59,648
Before you had to buy at least one if not both of those separately for like

566
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,184
40 bucks a pop

567
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
50 bucks a Pop Evil

568
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
So

569
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
You're getting that now

570
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
Included

571
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
I'm glad you mentioned this though

572
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:13,472
Remember how I started by saying you have an old Nvidia Shield don't upgrade cuz you don't need it cuz you're going to get all the same software the

573
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
Voice remote start

574
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,104
Built into the game controllers you may want to get a new

575
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
Controller

576
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
For your old Shields I'm going to give him mine

577
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Got it

578
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
All right

579
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
Feel like we're out of time

580
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:31,136
So I'm going to do a pretty quick review of stringify to tell you about it

581
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,952
And then we'll spend some more time another show

582
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
So stringify

583
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
Is

584
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:42,912
Kind of like it's a way for you to connect lots of devices together and create what they call flows which are

585
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
Basically recipe

586
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
Puppies for

587
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Making something

588
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,032
So the reason this is

589
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:52,128
Cool are useful as they finally released an Android version

590
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,432
Now the Android version is still in beta

591
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,760
And so it's not as full functioning at the iOS version

592
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:02,880
If you're really into the smart home and you have a bunch of devices it supports a lot of devices like

593
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,672
30 or 40 that I have

594
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:10,560
And then it also supports more than one conditional statement so you know where if this and that you have to do

595
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,328
There's no limit

596
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
What you do is you

597
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,424
Bring all of the devices in onto what they call it

598
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,776
And if you do download this I really recommend you watch the video on

599
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
On how to do this because it is

600
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
It's not super into

601
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,664
So the video on how to make flows is

602
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,016
So you pick all of your devices and let's say

603
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,296
I want to do

604
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Think of something to do

605
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Okay

606
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,416
When my Nest cam

607
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
She's a person

608
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
And I'm not at home

609
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
Send me an email

610
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,048
And also turn on the light

611
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,864
So that doing that and if this

612
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Would take

613
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
Multiple redis

614
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,752
So here what I would do as I pull in my Nest cam

615
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
I told him my location

616
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,384
Little icons for each device

617
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,688
Accolade my location icon

618
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,992
And I'm going to put those on

619
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,784
The left side everything

620
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
Goes from left to right here

621
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,392
And then I'm going to also the things I want to have happen

622
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,696
Email icon and then

623
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:15,328
What am I doing I'm going to pull in the light

624
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:21,472
So then basically set a trigger for each of those so location is when I'm away

625
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,776
When I see a person

626
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,080
On the other side

627
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,872
I'm going to set triggers for each of those

628
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,944
And then I basically link them I just remove

629
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,272
Click on that icon and then I move it over to each of the

630
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
Things that I want to have happen

631
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
When something happen

632
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,904
Decrease bass strings between them in

633
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,720
I created a fairly complex

634
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,512
End

635
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,048
This again

636
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,888
You're going to have to play with this I'm going to do a review eventually they will have

637
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
Screenshot

638
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,448
Really helpful

639
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
This is free

640
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,592
They support you know things like the echo the Aesop

641
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,408
Arlo netatmo

642
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
Nest

643
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,760
Like an amazing array of services I think ecobee

644
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
They don't do Sonos

645
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,576
So just

646
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
Telling you there

647
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,392
Skybell

648
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
Don't know if they do August

649
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,488
It's a pretty comprehensive system

650
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,376
It's free the way they pay for it is they actually do the same sort of thing for Enterprise customers and

651
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,936
Those guys actually

652
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,752
So yeah so instead of the Enterprise have to

653
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,312
Figure out all the apis for all these devices and

654
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:33,920
Sing themselves they actually do this for Enterprise customers they give

655
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,456
Like corporate it Department

656
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,016
These flows and support devices

657
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,296
Antos

658
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
Systems

659
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:44,672
So that they don't actually charge they just pull a PS4

660
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,256
Like for the Facebook and web-based ones they usually just pulled like the

661
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
Publicly available apis

662
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,072
10 + 4

663
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
The device

664
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
They actually usually

665
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
Conversation with

666
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
That makes it okay

667
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,496
Interesting model business model

668
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,800
It is like

669
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,152
I encourage anyone who's got multiple devices who's interested in

670
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,688
More complicated

671
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,992
Smart home programming to check this out

672
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,552
And it still bare bones

673
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,832
On the Android side

674
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,160
IOS is better and they're still features that they need to add

675
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
That'll come

676
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
Cool

677
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,280
Stringify

678
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Now

679
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072

Don't go anywhere because several guests

684
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,336
We're going to talk about the industrial internet

685
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,128
Where it's at today

686
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,688
How companies can bring in several vendors

687
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
And even advice for companies who are

688
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,320
Just starting to work with some of these big

689
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,880
Providers and how they can keep their pricing at margin

690
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:50,976
Staple it's going to be good

691
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:57,376
Everyone we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast with a message from our sponsor this way sponsor is dead

692
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,216

Ivan it sounds great

728
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
So where can I find

729
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,680
You can put on information you need from

730
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
Dot-com

731
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,520
Which is our URL

732
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:49,920
We have a lot of interesting iot case studies from there too

733
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:56,320
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things

734
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,648

735
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,184

00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,096
So this is an industrial iot lab

739
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:14,752
Where I learned about a lot of crazy cool things and I talked to Jamie Smith the director

740
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
Instruments

741
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,592
An Alex devron CEO

742
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,688
Alex had the lovely Irish lilt

743
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Voice

744
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,296
So I'm Jamie Smith on the director of embedded systems here in Nashua

745
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,136
Aaron the Chief Executive Officer of

746
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,952
All right today we're here

747
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,048
Launching their industrial internet-of-things lab

748
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,096
Which you guys maybe like

749
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,448
There's actually so many people playing Industrial internet-of-things

750
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,752
Figuring out how to get everything to work together

751
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
Is

752
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,824
So let's kick this off with

753
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
Question about Partnerships

754
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,920
IC HP

755
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,760
So I thought until disco there's a lot of people here

756
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,808
How to companies

757
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,344
Bring you in

758
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,184
Are they bringing you in a massive conglomeration

759
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
Or

760
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,232
Are they bringing you in

761
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,048
That's a really good question

762
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,632
Because it is a large number of collaborators

763
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,168
These complex systems

764
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:19,008
And the customer engagements happen in a wide range

765
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,128
So what natural is expert in measure

766
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,408
Technology

767
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,712
Processing right there at the edge

768
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,272
Where sensors are coming into the

769
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
The industrial

770
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
Thanks

771
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624
And all the collaborators we work with are aware of

772
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:38,208
So when their customers and their engagement

773
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,560
Additional sensing capability additional measurements or some form of advance

774
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,888
Troll right there at the edge still bring us in

775
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,680
Location

776
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,960
So where is

777
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Your Edge

778
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,312
Because he could be a Gateway or it could be like that

779
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:59,968
Really good question as well that will redefine The Edge know if we think about or a traditional definition

780
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
And it's where the

781
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:06,112
Enterprise Network begins and is the barrier to the office Network

782
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,904
Home network begins or is it

783
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,208
Valerie to the internet service provider

784
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,000
That's the typical Edge boundary

785
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,792
I just got back from CVS

786
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,096
MSc industrial internet

787
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,144
Consumerism

788
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
Low margin

789
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:20,960
Blah blah blah

790
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
Where is the industrial internet

791
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
Where is it going

792
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,384
So the industrial internet today it's happening

793
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,016
Distributed systems in becoming more open

794
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,808
More complex

795
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,624
And collaboration of or vendors drysol

796
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,904
Inside

797
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,488
But the majority of Industries and companies

798
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,792
Have not adopted

799
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,120
So we're just getting started

800
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,168
Scratching the surface

801
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
But we're seeing a lot of interest

802
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
And

803
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,568
Indiana

804
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
Technology stocks

805
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
Becoming validated

806
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,224
Chest pains like we have in the lab

807
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:10,112
And if we can educate more of these and customers about

808
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,928
Then they can start doing a pilot

809
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
Program

810
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
And they move on

811
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
Broader adoption

812
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,536
Spaghetti.

813
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,560
Insights

814
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,328
Required

815
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,400
When you guys actually like to talk about your

816
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:27,008
Because that ties to a couple things he's mentioned already one is it

817
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,800
They didn't have anything

818
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,616
And now they have with a 30000 sensors

819
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,176
How did that come about

820
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:34,944
End

821
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,248
Is there a typical

822
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,808
I would say there is no typical yet

823
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
Industrial air

824
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,160
Duke Energy is the largest

825
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,184
Power provider

826
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,976
United States and

827
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
They

828
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,304
Realize that they can improve

829
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,096
Overall up time

830
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,888
All of their facilities they have more

831
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
They had

832
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
Experts in

833
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,544
Analysis of this vibration database rotini

834
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
Equipment

835
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,616
But they spent 80% of their time

836
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,896
Data collection

837
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,456
20% of their time analyzing

838
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,480
The database

839
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,016
They want to flip that

840
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,576
So they put an effort out to

841
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,880
Measurement taking

842
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,744
It's been 80%

843
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
Their data

844
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,048
Ensuring uptime

845
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,840
LS timing chain

846
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
How is the data collected

847
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,240
So the data was collected originally by walking around

848
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,032
Portable measurement equipment

849
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:38,176
Add capturing information that they needed to be transferred into a spreadsheet or another application

850
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
Now these systems

851
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,760
Online always acquiring

852
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,296
Connecting to the network

853
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,576
Defeat

854
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,112
Air plant Astoria

855
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,928
So there

856
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
Look at that data

857
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,424
Crafts to build on that to you know when we look at some of this aging infrastructure that's probably not on

858
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,960
The world

859
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,544
Part of the data collection process use that many of these large power plants

860
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
Is the human

861
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,664
And it can literally get a simple or a sophisticated

862
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,968
I'm going to touch

863
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,016
Machine to feel the vibration

864
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,832
And I'm going to listen to it

865
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,624
As a data collection and

866
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:26,304
Any customers in the similar situations are experts at doing this also

867
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,096
Tend to be getting a little older

868
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,376
And headed towards retirement

869
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,448
And they're worried about the ability to be able to replicate.

870
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,984
So as we

871
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,800
Deliver technologies that make it practical to

872
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
To be able to collect that data

873
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,128
In a synchronized fashion

874
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,664
Securely ideally

875
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,200
Future over wireless network

876
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,016
And then we developed story

877
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,088
Ability from a prognostic view

878
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,416
To record the symptoms of an impending

879
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,208
Future failure downtime

880
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:58,048
And that learning can be learned once and applied many times

881
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,352
In an automated fashion to dramatically

882
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,144
Iraq time zone

883
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:06,240
Answer the customer that also dramatically improve their use of energy

884
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,288
Which is an interest

885
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,384
All of these partners

886
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,944
How do you guys

887
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,480
Wright contract

888
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,784
Sell the product in a way

889
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,576
Ensures you guys

890
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,624
Get the value for what your

891
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,696
Massive numbers of companies

892
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,744
It just feels very.

893
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:31,328
We as a company Nestle

894
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,608
I've always

895
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,144
Operated as part of an ecosystem

896
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,960
Where are the ultimate end solution

897
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Involved

898
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,288
Strom multiple suppliers

899
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,568
To be delivered

900
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,128
Tool supplier in the system supplier to scientist

901
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,968
So this has been our standard business model in r

902
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:52,576
Testing measurement market and we've applied this to as we've expanded our capability outings

903
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,160
That's a first of the business model is really clear

904
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,464
Hermosa apartments that we're engaging with

905
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:02,304
It's relatively well understood their portion in value chain

906
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,608
And ultimately the customer will decide

907
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,192
Some situations like Duke Energy the customer will choose

908
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,008
To purchase components from different

909
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,544
Kalamazoo Valley training

910
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,872
And that's a valuable use case

911
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,944
In other cases the customer want to

912
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,248
Just have one in Topeka

913
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,296
To deliver that complete value chain

914
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:27,392
And in that situation in a We have dealt with that is a business for many years and have a

915
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,208
I really clear way to to Castro Valley

916
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,768
City of tips for companies who are kind of it

917
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,328
There's a coming out this for maybe the first time

918
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,680
Well it certainly understanding your value and the solution is the single most

919
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,592
Understanding have differentiated your value is not have differentiated you'd like it to be or you might want it to be but a different you

920
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,128
It actually is

921
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,944
Can you get that from the customer to get that work

922
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,248
I think you get that from the customer absolutely

923
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,552
You know some cases it can get clouded

924
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,392
We have a great benefit because we also have a direct field Salesforce

925
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,952
So we have direct access to the customer

926
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:05,792
We sell to over 35000 different companies

927
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,584
Around the world every year

928
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,656
And we have deep relationships that the engineer to end

929
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
Engineer

930
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,984
And so our value

931
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,312
Is generally relatively well understood already

932
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,128
Two core constituencies within that customer

933
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,688
And that helps provide the frame of reference

934
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,712
House divided

935
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,248
A benchmark for us

936
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
To be able to

937
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
Engage with

938
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,624
A complete system level provider so my advice and Ensure

939
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:34,464
Would be understand your value understand how differentiated it is

940
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Truly

941
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,304
And I would try to establish a price position

942
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,096
Independent

943
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,936
Selling direct to individual customers

944
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,240
To be able to validate my first two assumption

945
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,568
And be able to prove both to the End customer and my

946
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
Immigration partners

947
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,384
The value that I bring

948
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
Tomorrow

949
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,223
I would think also your relationship with engineers

950
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,247
Is important

951
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
As we seen in clouds

952
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,087
Developers are awesome

953
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
End

954
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,951
There's a lot more respect now for

955
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,559
On the industrial side is that same sort of

956
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,423
It may not be Grassroots but it might be respect for the technical

957
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,959
Absolutely

958
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,007
Ways we look at I-10.

959
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
Converging

960
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,079
The people will understand the problems and needs

961
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,615
Address of those on the fact

962
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,151
Where are the plants

963
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,967
In the field with the customer

964
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,831
So they understand

965
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,111
Needs what

966
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
Chang

967
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,695
But they may not have the insights in Denver

968
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
Information technology

969
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,559
Analytics Cloud technical respect

970
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,583
Pyside

971
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
Novation

972
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,143
Bad it's becoming

973
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,935
Clear that these groups

974
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215
Together

975
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,031
And I would say that's the biggest shift I've seen

976
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,591
Look at the first part of my career

977
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,871
National instruments

978
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
There was

979
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,199
A desire for

980
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,503
Companies to provide freestyle over

981
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,575
Close systems to own the entire solution

982
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,623
And in some cases even hold a customer

983
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,439
Today those

984
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:13,023
Barriers are being broken down and companies are supplying to

985
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
Customers

986
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,607
Have a willingness in a desire to collaborate

987
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,399
And the customers are demanding

988
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:25,055
And so as companies are evaluating what move to make for the industrial internet-of-things

989
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,591
End customers

990
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,639
The one piece of advice I would give to down

991
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
Is 2 don't wait

992
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:34,271
Put down your biggest challenge your biggest headache your biggest

993
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
Opportunities for improvement

994
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,135
Start working to see how you can address that issue

995
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,719
That starting point can blossom real impact

996
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,535
And then to the next project

997
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,607
Izzy's Transformations are not going to be

998
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,399
Enterprise why all of

999
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,959
And some people have that view and

1000
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,847
You guys are the people who are going to make a difference

1001
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,383
And you should totally be

1002
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,663
So sad

1003
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,759
And now go to Jim heppelmann the CEO of

1004
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,783
GTC

1005
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,391
We talked about how PTC is acquired several companies such as

1006
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Xidan

1007
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,231
Vuforia from Qualcomm

1008
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,767
And kept where

1009
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,791
Alta build

1010
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:21,631
A platform for the internet of things called thingworx

1011
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
Oh yeah

1012
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,423
And it also

1013
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,703
Acquired thingworx

1014
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,263
So I checked in with Jim to find out

1015
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,799
How a year later

1016
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,847
Those Acquisitions were performed

1017
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,151
Division is alive and well

1018
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,199
Business is doing exceptionally well

1019
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,855
Machine learning and Predictive Analytics

1020
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:46,463
Find out what we need to know and then to be able to turn around using augmented reality

1021
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,279
And kind of decorate your view of that will physical world

1022
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,327
Important digital information

1023
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
AR is less

1024
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:03,359
Service technician

1025
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,175
I think we're where the early days of AR

1026
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,455
Screwing

1027
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,807
Do this a scam

1028
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,367
The big thing now is the digital eyewear

1029
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,927
As the July where becomes better

1030
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,975
And a little more ubiquitous

1031
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,839
That will unleash a wave they are

1032
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,119
And we need to explain it

1033
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,191
And there's no better way than to make it visual

1034
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,263
Linda put it in context of the physical world

1035
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,103
So I think we're we're at the edge of the big toe

1036
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,967
There is substantial breakthroughs happening with digital eyewear I mean the Microsoft hololens

1037
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,271
Unbelievable

1038
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:46,111
Snapchat spectacles

1039
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:50,463
What we need is this going to be something like this smartphone which

1040
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,743
Super spring in

1041
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,815
Technology

1042
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,863
Industrial-grade

1043
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:03,263
She just heading to consumer-grade pretty quickly I think Microsoft is targeting

1044
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,687
What's happening right now as consumers are using

1045
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,223
Phones and tablets

1046
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
As a proxy

1047
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
4 spyglass

1048
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,879
Do you actually get the same experience the downfall is it ties up your hands

1049
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,927
Social service technician

1050
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:24,255
Can I use a tablet or a phone to see what they need to see

1051
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
They were just work

1052
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,215
Fluidly

1053
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,007
Without interruption because their hands

1054
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,079
So in a sense I'm going to go crazy

1055
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,127
Voice for the iot

1056
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Is Kai.

1057
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,575
Telling you information for the Internet of Things

1058
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,367
You're saying vision

1059
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,183
Computer generated AR is going to

1060
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,607
I like it

1061
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:04,447
That brings up another point which is if the pictures on in contacts

1062
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,751
Can you have to do a mental mapping

1063
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:13,151
Is what happens to you in the car all the time when your navigation system in your dashboard says turn left on this street

1064
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:13,919
Play was it

1065
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:18,271
You look down to the windshield

1066
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:20,831
And it's a

1067
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,367
Process requires a fair amount of

1068
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,183
And then if I could

1069
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:30,559
You know hemispherical view of the world where I can look up down left right

1070
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:34,143
So basically I'm saying is if we can figure out with smart glasses

1071
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,935
How to decorate the world

1072
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,471
Your aunt's room you're in

1073
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,519
What information do you need to know about the

1074
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,383
Your ability to ingest that information

1075
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,407
Literally

1076
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,735
It would be to read it off

1077
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,271
Screen of your phone

1078
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,855
It's a big idea of iot

1079
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,415
Chris so much data so much knowledge

1080
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,463
Physical world that you can't see

1081
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,559
You look at it in the computer and then mentally map it

1082
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,863
We just want to decorate what you see

1083
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
What you need to know

1084
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,959
So that feels like we need some sort of standard

1085
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,311
14 Mattapan

1086
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:24,575
I'm not a hundred percent sure if it needs to be a standard but I think we definitely need techniques

1087
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,879
What did you think about

1088
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,463
User interface development on computers

1089
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:36,095
Microsoft has a set of techniques apple has a slightly different set of techniques and other vendor might be slightly different

1090
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:41,215
There are good practices for developing grassley's Renovators in bed rack

1091
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,287
If we move down with the AR prices

1092
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,591
It's just the wild west end

1093
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,615
Definitely

1094
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:51,199
State-of-the-art

1095
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,991
This well

1096
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,551
And hopefully using familiar paradigms

1097
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,855
From one device to another

1098
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,135
Like I can move from us

1099
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,975
You don't Android phone to an Apple phone and they're not really that different

1100
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,047
I can figure it out

1101
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
Pretty quickly

1102
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,703
Problems

1103
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,543
Is the Amazon Echo

1104
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
I like

1105
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:28,063
I can only imagine that if I switch from

1106
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,367
Is it is not as big a deal in industrial

1107
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:40,095
I think the whole idea they are is to make information Visual and a coil

1108
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,375
What to put in contacts

1109
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,447
So that you can actually process it without thinking

1110
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:50,079
Driving your car you pull up to a stop light

1111
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,639
Stop look and say oh

1112
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,175
That looks like a stoplight

1113
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,455
Shred

1114
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,991
Red means stop

1115
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,063
Okay there for me to stop you just do it what are some

1116
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,343
Mercy

1117
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,719
Directions

1118
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:10,047
I didn't receive last thing first of all it's a powerful idea

1119
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,143
Many many demonstrations approve that

1120
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,191
People are far more productive

1121
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,727
And make mistakes

1122
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,007
So I think there are

1123
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,543
Mini case studies now

1124
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,103
From PC and from various others the show

1125
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,127
Norma

1126
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,687
Reason I don't see they are Belong Together.

1127
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,735
Because they are Death Race

1128
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,759
Physical world

1129
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
Decorated with what

1130
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,623
We need information from the physical world

1131
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:39,487
An understanding

1132
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,535
What is the

1133
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
Addition

1134
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,863
What is the status what is the action you should take

1135
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,167
How do I convey that status in

1136
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:51,263
Addition to you and then how do I convey to you

1137
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,311
Right because right now

1138
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
Information

1139
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,199
I can tell you how many steps I've taken I can tell you

1140
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,783
The temperature

1141
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:06,111
That does me no good without being a

1142
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,391
I'll take any sort of

1143
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,927
So

1144
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,231
If you think back to driving a car

1145
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,023
You have a navigation system

1146
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,559
Can you have the music

1147
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:19,935
And if I could cherry-pick the information for the navigation screen and give you a heads up display

1148
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,959
On the windscreen

1149
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,495
Not to say

1150
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,799
There are three roads coming up and you should take the

1151
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,823
The second one

1152
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,151
What to actually say see this road right here

1153
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,247
Of course if you think now

1154
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,783
Fighter pilots have had

1155
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,319
Heads up displays for a long time

1156
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,719
So if we could

1157
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,511
Ocean of the

1158
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,791
Heads up display

1159
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,583
Put it on everything

1160
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,119
People

1161
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,399
Furniture

1162
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,191
Industrial objects Farm

1163
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:58,591
Give you a heads-up display on everything simply by putting on her glasses and everything you interact with

1164
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:02,431
Has a heads-up display optimized for interacting with that thing

1165
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,223
I think it's a big part 1

1166
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,527
Savannah would be like this is a person

1167
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,647
Business

1168
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,231
Oh we don't have enough standards we don't have it

1169
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,255
Anythink

1170
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:23,167
Okay if I engage you in a social context

1171
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:28,031
If I'm your doctor I want to have a completely different perspective of Stacy

1172
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,079
Even though I might

1173
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
Let's talk about

1174
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,199
Security because

1175
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,991
What we're talking about here

1176
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,527
The number one reason

1177
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,319
Companies say that they're not

1178
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,743
What should baby

1179
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:56,447
I think this notion of iot being a new set of security problem is wrong

1180
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,263
It's the same security problems we have

1181
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,079
It's just more things are computers

1182
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:07,199
Right now and we're extending them to things that you didn't think of it

1183
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,039
More and more

1184
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,831
These things in our computers week

1185
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:25,119
Play did you think of a power plant you know

1186
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,423
Computer control

1187
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,471
I think the security

1188
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:35,103
There's no CIO that can save my data center is safer than it was 10 years ago

1189
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,407
They just can't really say that

1190
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:43,807
They might have invested a tremendous amount in technology and techniques and practices.

1191
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
More secure

1192
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,623
We just in an open-ended battle

1193
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,159
What is going to be the big things

1194
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
This year in a day

1195
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,487
But I'm saying in our business is back

1196
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:56,095
Has always been automated dirt or have been

1197
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,399
What's happening now if people are saying

1198
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,703
So much more

1199
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,007
And get it so much more data

1200
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,055
That would be useful in automation

1201
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,335
And I could

1202
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,455
Around what is this

1203
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
Telling me

1204
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,343
But I think I think what's happening is people are

1205
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:22,207
Our business is going very well

1206
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,071
And you ask what's driving most of that growth

1207
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,119
Laser Pilots

1208
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:34,495
Because people are just getting started a lot of the pilots are graduating

1209
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,519
Into

1210
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:39,871
Modified business you know real orders from real customers right now

1211
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:43,967
I think I said that our last earnings call that last year half of our Revenue

1212
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,111
Customers who were coming back for more

1213
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:59,839
