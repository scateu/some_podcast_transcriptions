00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,984
Hey everyone welcome to the inner

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,264
Internet of Things podcast

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,080
I am Stacey Higginbotham and I have my co-host

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,896
And we are here to guide you

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,456
This week show we're going to start talking about

7
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,736
Hacked cars

8
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:25,088
Should you be afraid the answer is probably yes we're going to talk about

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,880
Quirky the future of wink

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,928
And we are going to talk about

11
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,000
Heaven's latest and greatest smart home setup

12
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,024
We're going to talk

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,048
To Chris Bruce

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,912
About why crowdfunding is no longer the best way to fund a

15
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
Hardware

16
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,752
Alright let's kick it off

17
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,312
Have it wired has an awesome

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,080
Some story

19
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,872
On

20
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:51,712
This dude driving down the freeway in St Louis and all of a sudden

21
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,248
Hackers took over his

22
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,016
Chrysler

23
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784
Jeep

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,832
Chrysler Jeep LeBaron

25
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,624
Which is not Apple

26
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,184
It is a Jeep which is

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,744
And

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,048
It actually sounds pretty darn scary and

29
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,120
Yeah this is

30
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,168
Well concerning for a few reasons

31
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:15,264
A lot of people are talking about this today that they were recording the show

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
Essentially

33
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:21,152
Let me just get his name right here it was Adam I'm sorry Andy Greenberg

34
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
Who writes on

35
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,992
Security topics for Wired and what he did is he

36
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,832
Did a little experiment with two people Charlie Miller and

37
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
Chris Blazek

38
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,976
And those two guys are are hackers there known hackers they working

39
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:39,328
That one is work for the NSA I mean they paid their in the industry

40
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,376
I'm security and they have since

41
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,216
Going on and looked at different exploits for things in this time

42
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
It's connected cars and specifically

43
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,336
I think it's a 2014 Jeep Cherokee that

44
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,408
They were hacking into as the author

45
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,176
Andy was

46
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
Driving

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,992
On Highway 40 in St Louis

48
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,576
He says he was driving 70 miles an hour when the exploit began to

49
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,976
Take hold so let's just let's just pause for a second on what happened here and I'm really surprised they actually did the

50
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,048
In actual traffic on a highway

51
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,120
But essentially the two known hackers

52
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,680
Took control of his vehicle from afar

53
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
They weren't in the car they weren't near the car

54
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,824
They were able to cut the transmission cut the brakes

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
Change the radio station change the climate control excetera

56
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
Turn on windshield wipers

57
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
All kinds of things

58
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
Let's pause for a moment

59
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
Once you said cut the brakes

60
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,928
And they actually power down is transmission which meant he couldn't

61
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,304
Control the acceleration or anything in his car that's where I would focus like the fact that he couldn't

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,608
Move his windshield wipers at that point or

63
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
The radio station

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
Like I don't

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,984
Okay from a safety perspective I guess

66
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
Probably not

67
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,800
It would certainly not as big a deal is

68
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,592
As having control of the

69
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,152
Are the cars actually no acceleration and so on

70
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
They could even control the steering wheel

71
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
But only when the car is in reverse

72
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:05,600
They think they can do on the cars going forward with this to be a full remote control on hack

73
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
And they did it from 10 miles away

74
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:12,512
And they did it in this is this is relevant they did it actually over the cars cellular now

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,608
I think she took the Jeep Cherokee has the Uconnect system

76
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,936
Which I think that this service is provided by

77
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,752
Sprint and what they do is they used a Sprint burner phone

78
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,056
And they were actually able to remotely

79
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,640
Do the space device-to-device connection from miles away

80
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
Exactly

81
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
So

82
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
What should we learn from

83
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,856
Well first of all don't do don't test me think on the highway I still can't believe they did this I could have done this anywhere but

84
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,648
Whatever that's beside the point

85
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,696
What do we learn from this that

86
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:47,584
The car industry this is actually something we already know the car industry does not move quickly model years or once a year

87
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:54,240
They changes far slower than the Consumer Electronics industry and yet they're putting consumer electronics capabilities

88
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
In the vehicles

89
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
So if nothing else

90
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,360
The car industry as a whole I'm not trying to

91
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
The point fingers here at

92
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
Chrysler at by any means cuz

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
This could have been done on any

94
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
Brand vehicle has got to connect a car

95
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
They all have to start taking this

96
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
Far more seriously

97
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
These two hackers demonstrated

98
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
Similar things on Toyota Prius 3 years ago

99
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,327
And Toyota said well yeah but you had to be in the car to do and at the time they did

100
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,655
But now these guys are proving you don't have to be in a car to do it so

101
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
The industry as a whole must

102
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,495
Begin to take this seriously

103
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
As a consumer I'm a little concerned

104
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
I mean I don't know what else I can say

105
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,639
But I'm a little concerned I do not have a connected vehicle

106
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,199
I don't think you do either at this point

107
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
Oh God now my car doesn't

108
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,063
But you're safe and don't worry you're safe

109
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
I like IHOP

110
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Automatic win

111
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,999
So we had actually episode 2 of the iot podcast I had Josh Corman on the show

112
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,791
We talked about this very issue

113
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
Josh is

114
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
Part of I am the cavalry

115
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,959
It's an organization that's made up of Security Professionals

116
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:02,591
And it's purely voluntary their nonprofit that is trying to educate the media the government

117
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
And

118
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,663
Anybody who will listen basically

119
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
About

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,247
Security for connected devices

121
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
And one of their first efforts was the

122
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
Automotive industry

123
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
So Senator Markey introduced a bill

124
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,231
This week that is designed to protect

125
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Consumers against

126
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,071
Breaches of privacy and security from

127
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,119
Did killer hacking basically

128
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:31,775
I'm in a lot of those are similar to kind of the principles outlined in the automotive framework that I

129
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
I am the cavalry

130
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Had

131
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,871
Post so they're things like

132
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,455
Basically if a car has been hacked is there a way that

133
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Vehicle

134
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
Shows that has been hacked like a trail

135
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
That you can

136
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
Kind of show and prove

137
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,415
Is there a disclosure policy that

138
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,743
It shows what you do if a car has been hacked

139
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,327
And a way to communicate to customers what is happened

140
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,911
Can your vehicle be securely updated in a prompt manner

141
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
So like 4

142
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
Example this this recent

143
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
Cheap thing

144
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
The way that the update

145
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
Happens is an over-the-air it is

146
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
USB drive

147
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
Wish

148
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
You either have to

149
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,551
You can actually download the the update onto a USB drive yourself

150
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,855
Or what most people probably do is go to a dealer

151
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,671
Or really what most people do is sell be like

152
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,975
That sucks

153
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,815
So these are some real issues I know with

154
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
BMW

155
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,911
And I think we talked about this on that that episode

156
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
At the podcast

157
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
They actually had some

158
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Walking

159
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Issues and they actually

160
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,615
Change their system to be an over the air update

161
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
To deal with it

162
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
And that kind of

163
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
Worked for them

164
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
But in the past

165
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,831
Auto manufacturers didn't want to do over there updates cuz they perceived that to be a c

166
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
Security risk

167
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:54,975
So in a lot of ways there's like a damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-don't kind of

168
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,047
Feeling and mentality among these guys so

169
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
Got episodes really into

170
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
Sing this whole issue is really in

171
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
Interesting

172
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,007
There's very much a sense here that we cannot ignore this any longer

173
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,823
And hopefully the industry

174
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,639
I I would hope not I mean I would hope that

175
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,479
They don't wait too long to wear somebody gets hacked and seriously injured

176
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
Before they actually take action

177
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
You hate to see that happen

178
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
So that's

179
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,415
That's the biggest challenges in getting their attention now is good

180
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
I don't even think

181
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:31,327
Because I don't think it's really out of the realm of possibility that we're going to have driverless vehicles at some point

182
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,887
It's not really a question of if it's question of when

183
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
And

184
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
At that point

185
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
You know

186
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,311
It's something that you pretty much given all control over to a system in the car

187
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
And

188
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,383
Did the situation could be even worse

189
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,503
That's something we talked about or is that something the bill covers and something that this

190
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,831
Standard the security standard that these guys published

191
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
Talks about and that's kind of

192
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,023
It's called air gapping or physical isolation so not every system should be able to connect to the Internet so

193
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,815
What are the critical systems

194
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:06,399
It's like maybe the steering should never be connected to anything

195
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Disconnected

196
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
Maybe acceleration should

197
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
I don't know

198
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
I mean there are definite advantages

199
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,103
To having that especially if we're talking about self

200
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Self-driving vehicle

201
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,919
So how do we how do we build that in

202
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Again

203
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
Real questions that we need to figure out

204
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,111
And I think also this mentality and I don't think

205
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:32,511
Detroit or you know the big Automotive manufacturers really have this yet I think some of them do so Tesla I think

206
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,095
I think probably some of the German car manufacturers are getting there

207
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
Is this idea that

208
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,679
You can actually build a connected

209
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
If ice and have it

210
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
Stay static and secure right

211
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,567
Nothing Bill disconnected

212
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Ecstatic

213
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
It's always going

214
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
To be continually attacked

215
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,223
So we have to start building things that are going to be

216
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,527
Continually updated and reacting

217
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
To their environment

218
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,367
And you know the attacks that are going to happen to them

219
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,695
That is a huge mentality shift not just for like

220
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
Automotive industry good for every industry

221
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
Is building anything

222
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,887
I agree and I would second your

223
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Your point about

224
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
Either firewalling off

225
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Or

226
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,543
Sandboxing certain system so that they don't interact with each other

227
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:21,407
To to alleviate in a total control our Total Takeover that's that's an obvious problem

228
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
Takeaways for people who really care deeply about this

229
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
Www. IM

230
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
The cavalry

231
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
. org

232
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,159
Is where you can find more information on this

233
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
The article that were referencing

234
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Came from wired

235
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,279
And we should probably move on

236
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,071
For all the people who are getting upset

237
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,655
Or maybe there's a couple New Yorkers out there like I don't have a car I don't care

238
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,007
Well let me listen to this in your car don't don't panic

239
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Don't panic

240
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,591
And if your car does get taken over

241
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
Pop your hazards on

242
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
Popular driving in

243
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
The neutral if you can

244
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,991
I just got a beer over

245
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,319
To the right side of the road or your near shoulder

246
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,879
And just you know calmly exit The View

247
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
That's about the best

248
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
Device settings

249
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
I can offer you got any other advice for those folks

250
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
That's probably best advice you could give at this point

251
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
Don't panic

252
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
Don't panic

253
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
I'll stick with The Hitch-Hiker

254
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,519
Guide to the Galaxy advice which really works in just about any

255
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
Any

256
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
Grab your towel

257
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
And don't pay

258
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
All right

259
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Let's move on to quirky

260
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
I was at the fortune brainstorm

261
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Tech events

262
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Last week

263
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
In Aspen

264
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
If you listen to last week

265
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Flicks podcast

266
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Do you know this

267
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,975
And we got to see Ben Kaufman who is the CEO of quirky

268
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,327
Come out on stage and talk about both quirky's future

269
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,143
And where it is now and also Corky

270
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,447
Has a majority ownership stake in wink

271
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
The connected home

272
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Gadget company

273
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Software

274
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
Hub thing

275
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,895
And he talked to that was a terrible description

276
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
Why do they let me have a pot

277
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
I don't even know

278
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,271
So he talked about kind of Winx future

279
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
So, bullet points there

280
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
Ben got up on stage

281
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,927
And it was a hilarious interview I really suggest

282
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
If you get a chance

283
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,279
Because it was a model of transparency

284
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,351
In the sense that he basically answered every question that was put to him

285
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
Really brutally honest

286
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,471
And he said basically that Corky is out of money

287
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
It is seeking more money

288
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
He gave some advice like

289
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,847
Don't start a startup within a startup

290
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,687
And that's really hard to do and that's kind of why wink

291
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Was

292
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
For sale

293
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
Wink is no longer for sale

294
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,159
It sounds like he pulled wink after the security snafus that affected wink back in April

295
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,207
You guys may have remembered that

296
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
They did a security update

297
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,071
April that kind of bricks a whole bunch of wink devices and

298
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,167
People who died that didn't come back online they had to physically mail their devices

299
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
Back to

300
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Quirky

301
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
And then

302
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
Corky had to reset them in

303
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
Email them back to the home

304
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
Was kind of a big

305
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
Wakanda

306
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
Brouhaha

307
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
Yeah it was it was not ideal for any

308
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,039
But they actually solve the problem that was awesome for them and

309
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,599
Homeowners did not lose their settings which was

310
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
Nice

311
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
So after that happened

312
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
Cricket they took quirky off the mall

313
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
I'm sorry it took wink

314
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Off the market

315
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,327
So what what we know now is that quirky

316
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
The parent company has $12 in cash

317
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
That is

318
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,703
Exceeded by its liabilities

319
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,519
None of its creditors want to put it in the bank

320
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
So then gave me his option

321
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Order

322
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,663
The first is Wink raises no less than 5

323
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
And that gets it through a couple of years

324
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:41,599
His second option is quirky raises money and that's enough to help both businesses stay afloat

325
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
But it doesn't solve his problem that he

326
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,951
He's got two different businesses he's trying to

327
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
And he doesn't really want to run both of them

328
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,559
Is third option is he

329
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Put swing back on the market

330
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Which

331
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
He's not really a fan of

332
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
In his fourth option is so quirky and wing

333
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
And he really doesn't

334
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Is that all

335
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
He's assured me that

336
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
People who have won cups

337
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
Do not worry about the

338
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
Detroit there wink hubs

339
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,807
Wink will find a buyer we got lots of information about

340
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,855
Wink it is by far

341
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
Like I usually successful platform

342
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
So that's amazing

343
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
He did promise me that

344
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:27,167
Future generation of wink Hub that's going to kind of have direct support for Hue and kind of

345
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,287
Lower latency and things like that that will start seeing that support come out very soon

346
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
Which

347
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,919
I am really looking forward to I'm actually ready to plug in my wink and try it again

348
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,527
I'm here with that BS software update to the existing hubs

349
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,087
That is unclear he made it sound like

350
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,903
I could see that as soon as like the end of this month

351
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
I'm going to try it in

352
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
MC

353
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,279
It could be a software update

354
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
Actually

355
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,887
I see that describe to me two different

356
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
So I'm going to plug in my existing

357
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
See

358
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,567
Cuz right now the way that wink supports the Philips Hue Lights for exam

359
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,407
Is problematic of the latency side because basically

360
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,015
You're talking to the wink Cloud that then calls out to the Hue cloud

361
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,319
That then says do this

362
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
And then

363
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
All of this happen

364
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,927
It's a it's a chain of cloud events at that point

365
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
But they were saying that

366
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
They will have

367
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Philips cloud

368
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
Cloud

369
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,607
Integration so it should be faster

370
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
I'm unclear exactly

371
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
What that means

372
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
And no one's giving me real specifics

373
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Because

374
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,943
What I just described sounds kind of like Cloud to Cloud integration right

375
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
So

376
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
I'm like oh really

377
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
How to set how to set differ from

378
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,391
And then it'll just be faster

379
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,207
So if the net result is it faster

380
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
That's all.

381
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
Really cares about

382
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,911
So the other thing to know is the wink he said

383
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
Is now in 300000

384
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
Homes

385
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
That

386
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Is

387
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
Brazy

388
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
In one of those new

389
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
Is yours Kevin

390
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
That's correct

391
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
One of them is my that's why I asked the question about the software cup ticket

392
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
Yeah

393
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:25,951
Can we talk about that now we should I should also tell you that he says it's not going away so you should not be

394
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
Concern

395
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
And II would be a little

396
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,863
Still I've already I've already started it and eBay

397
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,679
Option for my wink Hub that I just bought that no kidding

398
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,727
No I'm going to ride it out and

399
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Brinkley

400
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:44,383
I only spent $50 on the wink Hub to begin with sweet I don't feel like it's a huge massive Financial loss it's

401
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
It's an annoyance if

402
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
If wink support actually stops and

403
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
Is one of the reasons I drive

404
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,319
Preached in the past I don't care for cloud-based

405
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,367
Home automation systems however

406
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,231
There's a reason I ended up going with the wing so let me know when I guess I should explain why that is

407
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,023
Two Worlds collided

408
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
Late last week

409
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,863
I was in Home Depot

410
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
And I saw the

411
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:10,751
Sylvania osram bulbs once or twice

412
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
With their whole

413
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
Lightify system

414
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
I don't think we talked about it

415
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
But yeah it's a nice

416
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,663
Yeah and and you can

417
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
Certainly by a lightify

418
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:23,807
Little plug-in Hub and whatnot I think was $50 for a bub a bold and the

419
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
Small plug-in hub

420
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,135
But I saw on the box that

421
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
The osram bulb with wink

422
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Certified

423
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
Let me see what the wink Hub cost

424
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
50 bucks

425
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
I said I could live with that

426
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:41,727
Let me let me try that in the reason I actually bought the wink Hub also was because even though I have a Philips Hue Hub here

427
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
And I thought the osram bulb would work with it

428
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:48,895
I'm like if it doesn't work with it then I get a bowl I really can't use to let me get the wink Hub now

429
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,479
If I don't need it I'll just return to the Home Depot on open no harm no foul

430
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,551
Well I couldn't get the osram bulb to pair with the

431
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
Hugh

432
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
Hub

433
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,135
So I'm like well I'm glad I bought this

434
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
WinCo

435
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,719
Can I talk to you in 5 minutes later set up my account

436
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,279
And was able to connect to the new bulb

437
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,839
I should mention the bulb itself

438
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:11,167
The standard LED bulb a19 base

439
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Or shape

440
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
And

441
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
It's $30 which

442
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:20,127
Is less than the Hue bulbs that aren't that you color those are $60 I believe

443
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,943
Yeah so this was 30 half that price

444
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
It's the same as

445
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
The Hue Lux

446
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
White

447
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
Yes

448
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
Which are $30

449
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,159
And you can even buy connected bulbs for

450
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,487
Connected white LED bulbs for as little as $15

451
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,535
So why did I choose a $30 bill

452
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,399
Because all of the connected white bulbs that I found including the locks if I'm not mistaken

453
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:47,519
They're all 2700 K color temperature which is the yellow e soft white color

454
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
And that's all you got

455
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
With the osram bulb

456
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,175
You get dimming which is pretty common in most of these bulbs

457
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
But you also get

458
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
Tunable color temperature for the white

459
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,319
So I can go from 2700 kelvins to

460
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:05,951
6500 Calvin's meaning I can go from a yellow light to a soft white to a bright white

461
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,487
All the way up to Daylight

462
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,839
So if you're familiar with those in the stores where you can see that the differences between

463
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
Soft white and daylight

464
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,911
This one dog does all of that

465
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:20,031
So I opted to spend the extra money and get the osram bulbs and I sent that at you more and I actually have three of them now

466
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,871
Did you work well with the wink Hub latency is really not an issue

467
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
Which is nice

468
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:30,783
And I mentioned at the beginning of this I said worlds are colliding once I knew I had a wink hub

469
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,087
In mine I quickly ordered

470
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,647
Next day delivery for an Amazon Echo

471
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,255
Is working wonderfully I can tell when we make sure the microphone is off on Alexa yes it is

472
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,071
I can tell Alexa to turn my office light on

473
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,863
Can I do that before you can walk into the room

474
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:50,495
Tell her to turn the family room lights on them to bulbs downstairs go on or go often

475
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,543
In the Wink app I scheduled

476
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,127
Times for the lights to go off to make sure nobody leaves them on all night and so on

477
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:01,759
It's working pretty well and and there are more wink devices than I realize so

478
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
/ $50

479
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,575
I thought it was a reasonably good investment

480
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,135
Don't know what it's it's really nice and

481
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,183
When I first reviewed the way

482
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,487
The bug oenis the hardware

483
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,791
The problem but I actually I've liked

484
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,351
What's the software a lot so I'm curious like

485
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
How did you find

486
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,191
Scheduling and how did you find the software employee

487
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,263
The software I think is reasonably good

488
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,103
I'm running it on iOS but I know there was an Android version as well

489
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:31,199
I took me a little time to find the scheduling aspect of it but it is

490
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
Pretty easy to set up

491
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
And it's working perfectly fine you can have

492
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,183
Daily things will weekly or every day I'm not at this point I just have the family room lights go off at 10:45 p.m.

493
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,255
Based on the schedule I've set that up in the iPhone app

494
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
No problem

495
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,327
I also like that you can set up shortcuts

496
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,631
In a one touch shortcuts to

497
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,423
Turn on one or multiple lights

498
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
You can do that in the app

499
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,775
But in iOS you also can make those

500
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,359
IOS widget so literally just pulled out of the top of your

501
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,687
IPhone screen and there I got three shortcuts that I can easily tap

502
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
To quickly turn lights on or off

503
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,295
Did the software also supports nest

504
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:12,159
And Isabella does replicate The Nest app in the Wink app so it's

505
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
Nothing fancy their butts

506
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,279
I hope they expand that in the future that's we'll have to see what happens there

507
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,583
Profile suffer Wisin

508
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,143
I think it's pretty simple and it certainly working well

509
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,471
So would you be interested cuz this is

510
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
Now that

511
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
WinCo

512
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,823
David actually added some sensors

513
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,127
They did also add

514
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
Z-Wave

515
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
Chickpea

516
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,247
Profiles so you could actually add some

517
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
So they have there

518
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Tripper

519
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Ink sensor

520
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Which

521
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
I looked at

522
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,927
I was like it's like 20 bucks for

523
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
Like basically a door sensor

524
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,303
That could be fun so when you open your door

525
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
A certain life

526
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Keto on

527
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
And they also have

528
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
What is today

529
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,983
I bet they do integrate with

530
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
The Chamberlain

531
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
Garage door opener

532
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823
If you have one of those

533
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,895
Blinds too I think they do

534
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,175
They do have some blinds

535
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
On the express Caesar

536
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
Well yeah if you have them already

537
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
And I think

538
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,879
You've got some Foscam cameras I don't know if they play with

539
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
Play nicely with flask

540
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:23,328
That's a good I forgot I forgot that even have those they're packaged up with of course the insteon stuff

541
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,632
Yes I know

542
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,448
Come on iPod hug this week

543
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,264
And it's true I'm not giving you enough credit

544
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,080
Ghetto send you in the show you've purchased it was

545
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:39,456
You've taken ownership of our not ownership you tried out some Hue bulbs you purchased a hug

546
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
You know I

547
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,832
I'm giving you credit man you're doing a great work there Kevin

548
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
Good job

549
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,672
Yeah I know I have cuz I've had I've installed the wing

550
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,488
Wingstop date they also work really well with the Lutron stuff

551
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:55,328
There's a bit of a delay that makes solution less satisfying

552
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,120
And that's actually something

553
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
Dd2 update

554
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
The Hub Louisville

555
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,240
Because that is a cloud thing in the Lutron stuff really benefit

556
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
It's from having

557
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
Device to device

558
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
To each other

559
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,152
But if you want to add some Z-Wave locks

560
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
You could have you could do that

561
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,736
And it would actually be a lot of fun

562
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,016
Cuz that when you like

563
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,552
Unlock the door some

564
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,976
Now there's like there's a lot of different possibilities around Cyrus again I went to the product page for the wink

565
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,816
Site and found more than I expected which was nice to say

566
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:30,656
What other aspect I like about the Hub aside from the low price

567
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,728
It doesn't have to be wired to your router

568
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,776
Where is I believe the hue

569
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,056
Hub.

570
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,640
It has to be connected via Ethernet that's a $7 extra

571
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,176
That's about

572
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:48,064
I think it's maybe 5 to $7 extra building materials to add Wi-Fi to

573
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,856
To the hub so

574
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,416
Which is interesting because the wink Hub is cheaper

575
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,952
Well they sell it at a loss

576
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,048
Well there's a couple that explains a whole lot about corgis

577
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
It does

578
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,144
It is not a product

579
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Sold for what

580
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
Well that's better

581
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,080
That's awesome I'm glad I look forward to hearing more about that and so we're going to call the Oscar and lights

582
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,872
Baby 5 minutes

583
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
Divisive

584
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,456
For this week

585
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,504
And so it was so real quickly

586
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,808
Since we spent more than five minutes kind of talked about that

587
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
You like these lights

588
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Are tunable

589
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,160
They're $30

590
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,744
Dimmable they are quiet when dimmed which is wonderful

591
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
Yes cuz

592
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,840
Because some of these lights like the Currys are there loud

593
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,656
They're not they're their got opaque they're not

594
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,728
Like the cheating link lights they're very they have a glare

595
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
A lot of people

596
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:46,176
These do output of around 810 lumens for those interested and they use 9.5 watts of power

597
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
Woohoo

598
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,552
Shuluxe they put out there they use 9 WhatsApp

599
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:56,928
Which is a random fact that my brain knows for I don't even know what she

600
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
So that is awesome

601
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
Thank you

602
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,512
So much

603
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
7 for this week

604
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,816
Answer

605
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
Guys

606
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
Stay tuned

607
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:08,448
Because our guest this week is Chris Bruce he's the CEO of sproutling

608
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,984
Who which is a

609
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,544
Actually connected baby monitoring device

610
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,336
Which would be a fascinating topic

611
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
The conversation

612
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
But we're not actually talking about that

613
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,944
We're talking about why crowdfunding

614
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,992
Is a dead model for hardware store

615
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
Keep listing

616
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,208
Hey everyone welcome back to

617
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:35,072
The Internet of Things podcast and today's guest is Chris Bruce who is the CEO of

618
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
Sproutling

619
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,400
Hello Chris thanks for joining us today

620
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,448
64 Avenue

621
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
I am super pumped

622
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:46,592
Because I think we talked about two years ago maybe when you guys were just building sproutling

623
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,688
That's right you were the very first interview

624
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
The company

625
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,040
It's great to be back in

626
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Sian

627
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,880
I will start with I really expected

628
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
You guys to have a

629
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,440
Protestant

630
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,976
Which is kind of part of the subject

631
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
Today's interview

632
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
And

633
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Sproutling

634
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
Fruit you guys are like

635
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Is this a plant thing what is this

636
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
It is

637
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,192
Really something I was very excited

638
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
And still am

639
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,752
It is a baby Mana

640
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,080
That your baby wears around his ankle

641
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
And it's

642
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,664
It's a 299 device that

643
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,248
It measures your baby skin temperature its heart rate motion

644
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,064
A variety of things and it connects with a

645
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
Divisive

646
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,904
It's in the room that has a microphone a temperature sensor

647
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,000
And the really awesome thing in the very forward-looking thing about this is

648
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:41,888
It's Gathering all this information and overtime it builds up a profile about your baby

649
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,752
Will hear Chris you explain it a little bit better about what it kind of can-do

650
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
The potential here

651
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:52,896
Sure it's very interested in this world

652
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,200
And all its information flowing in

653
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,248
You look at your car

654
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
Connected

655
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,184
There's a lot of data

656
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,024
The United States

657
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Taken 3 years to do

658
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,496
They managed to monitor 1070

659
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,616
And since then 1600 babies have been born

660
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:34,112
Really the world's first sensing learning in predicting any monarch

661
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
Temperature

662
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
Motion

663
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
And

664
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
Position

665
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
Like you mentioned

666
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,216
Noise level light level humidity

667
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,496
Does have a microphone

668
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,224
A statistical model for every

669
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:07,904
When there is a child's heart rate

670
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,744
Predictions

671
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
Give you recommendations

672
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
What if your

673
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,424
Able to lower the room temperature by 5 degrees

674
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,704
It's really about

675
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,008
Nelly having me smart internet connected

676
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
Devices

677
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,200
Unprecedented

678
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
Anywhere else before

679
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:37,600
And that's what's so exciting it's cuz I have I have a bunch of things that give me a lot of raw data

680
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:42,208
But the idea is especially as a parent when you don't get enough sleep as it is

681
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,744
Having something that's just like

682
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Hey

683
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
You

684
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,096
Lower the temperature in your baby's room and you can

685
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Can sleep longer

686
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,912
Oh that's like gold right

687
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,448
So

688
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
It's very exciting

689
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Now

690
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,056
When we last talked

691
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
Can I was this was still something you were working on

692
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:00,896
And then

693
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,432
It sounds like

694
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
You guys

695
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
Did a

696
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,832
You didn't do a Kickstarter you launched pre-sales a couple months back

697
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
Casino

698
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,184
Last August it was right so about a year ago

699
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
On your website

700
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,024
And then you promised that this would be

701
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
I shouldn't say promise that makes

702
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,632
What you said it would be out in March and that didn't

703
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Happen

704
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
And for their

705
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:28,800
You guys learned a really valuable lesson in that could have led to the reason that you're on the show today

706
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,336
Which is you tweeted that

707
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,664
You thought the model of young companies going on

708
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,200
Crowdfunding sites

709
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
In Kettering

710
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,576
You know sales and then Venture backing was just broken and it wasn't going to work anymore

711
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,624
And I'd love for you to kind of talk about

712
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
What you meant by that

713
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,440
In your experience here

714
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Or

715
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,376
Venture-backed

716
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
Started

717
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
Really popular

718
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,824
Dormant for a long time not allowed

719
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,872
Ace Hardware

720
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Cam

721
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,016
Ugly Hardware

722
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,952
Champion you have

723
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
Degrade

724
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:24,608
You had bleed motion with big braids

725
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
Funding campaigns

726
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,192
Really kicking off hardware company

727
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,824
Gunther angel

728
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
When on

729
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
Indiegogo

730
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
And

731
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
Got a lot of

732
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,040
Necropolis

733
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,112
I didn't raise the rest of them to actually bring the pasta market

734
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,392
And that was

735
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,440
Yeah and you had to do that as well

736
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:53,280
Company because the feces actually wanted to see that before they would

737
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:57,376
That boosted your valuation is a company it really helped you

738
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,448
I mean if you didn't go show the PCS

739
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
That you could

740
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:05,312
Get those kind of that interest at the customer level they weren't going to find you

741
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
Anyhow

742
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
So

743
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:12,480
That's exactly right

744
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,296
Wisconsin

745
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,368
Customers there

746
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
It was

747
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
Willie Morris

748
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,888
Where anytime

749
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
You can use it

750
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,448
Turn to having a baby

751
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,472
On a set date

752
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,592
Babies coming no matter

753
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,152
Shipping or not

754
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,968
You are the time we really tired of that we

755
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,040
You know we are pretty confident that we're going to be

756
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,088
We want you to be like any of the other one

757
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:57,024
Some seed money enough to get

758
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,352
And

759
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,144
We're looking good today

760
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
I think a lot of companies

761
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,264
Azan through crowdfunding campaign

762
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,176
One country to another

763
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,248
Other manufacturing issues after chemo

764
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,136
Before I could tell you how much it's going to cost

765
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,464
All of these possibilities with you

766
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:32,352
Which was hey we're going to

767
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,888
Docker sales

768
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,192
We're going to go raise a big round after that

769
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
Will be happy

770
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
Is that

771
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,080
I think the investors appetite

772
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
And

773
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,096
Pre-sales amount

774
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,448
But still have to go

775
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,496
Raise money and shows our numbers

776
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
I realize that

777
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,360
Most of the time that we looked at

778
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,480
Free shipping hardware company

779
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,296
Companies that should have been

780
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,600
You realize that.

781
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Twins in that

782
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,208
Really certain

783
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,280
Interpretation bicycle becoming unrealistic

784
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,864
In some cases they want to see the traction but

785
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,288
Not really early adopter Foxy's a product rule

786
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,360
Probably conceited cell

787
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,992
Party time

788
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,856
Now you may have a problem and its really

789
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,720
Is broken

790
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,840
I would do it completely different

791
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,632
Well I think you also got

792
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,656
Kind of the double

793
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,984
Another way me in the sense I guess this would be your triple Whammy

794
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,824
In that not only is it not an early adopter Market

795
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
But

796
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,944
There was enough publicity around campaigns that didn't ship in time

797
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,760
That if I were expecting a baby

798
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,320
Not only is a baby coming on a set date

799
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,624
But you only really care about monetary

800
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
Your baby at that level four

801
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,208
A relatively small amount of time

802
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,232
Like

803
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,840
The window in which your baby like you're freaking out about their sleep schedule is

804
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,144
It's like maybe a year year-and-a-half

805
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,216
Or even four months I mean depends on how

806
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,520
But

807
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,872
You know once they start sleeping through the night you get a little less frantic about like

808
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,200
Oh my God I pay anything for them to sleep an extra 20 minutes

809
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
Or are they going to know

810
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,064
Where you check in on them every every 5 Seconds

811
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,648
It's like I still breathing I can't believe they let me take this thing home from the hospital

812
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,464
So if it's late you know it

813
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,304
Is it important time it really does kind of become useless to you

814
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:16,960
And I can see how people would be very hesitant to invest you know I think you said it was 249 for

815
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
Pre-sales

816
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,032
As opposed to the 299 on the

817
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,312
How it would be now

818
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
So so that's a problem

819
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,920
So what did you guys do

820
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:31,552
How do you write I know you got some money initially from first round Capital but what did you guys do

821
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,856
To raise money or have you gone

822
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,744
Actually you don't ween raise

823
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,048
Erase another

824
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,072
Since then

825
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,864
Call me realize was

826
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,192
Try to go for a big round

827
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,984
Usually anywhere neighborhood

828
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
No

829
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,312
8 to 12 million after

830
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
T4

831
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
Huge

832
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,696
You know she did he drown

833
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,976
And

834
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,328
Take a little bit light-headed

835
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,168
And then really bring the Sparkle Market have enough money to actually

836
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,984
Try some sales in

837
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,568
Some products and then go around

838
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,848
I think the reverse

839
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,368
Finance the production of the people already bought

840
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
Until

841
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
Exact model

842
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:45,536
Definitely.

843
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,840
Like I said we took money out of

844
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,424
When this had in the past

845
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,544
Beebe actually got our products

846
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,920
Shipping in the market and other companies that are still struggling

847
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,528
Today parade presale

848
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,808
Canteen

849
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,088
Shift Impala

850
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,880
And there's a

851
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:14,720
And emotion

852
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
Kickstarter campaign and

853
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,584
Nobody buying

854
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,288
That's true and they had a lot of hype a lot of excitement and then

855
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,872
The product didn't quite live up so maybe it is better to

856
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,712
So maybe fewer and then iterate on your product

857
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,784
Over a smaller number of users

858
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,600
Congratulate make it better which is traditionally how

859
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
Products

860
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,904
Especially

861
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
Hardware type

862
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
Apple products have

863
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
Developed over

864
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,840
The crowdfunding

865
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
Krowd

866
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
He will

867
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
Very early.

868
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,192
So if you have

869
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,984
The Great Khali

870
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,056
Today shows is that

871
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
Elderly doctor

872
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,624
Coffee Cabin

873
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,208
To the morning stream consumer

874
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:23,072
And one of the biggest

875
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,608
But really prove that

876
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,984
And you also learned a valuable kind of PR lesson

877
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
I think

878
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,080
And I think it's worth noting for people

879
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,872
Because a lot of people still do

880
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,688
If not crowdfunding pre-sales on these things

881
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,528
And we should also talk about the value of pre-sales

882
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,320
And because you're still very

883
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,648
I want to say hi on pre-sales but you still find pre-sales to

884
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,416
To be very value

885
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,280
Circumstances

886
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,096
Crowdfunding campaigns

887
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
TR

888
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,752
And so if you really think about it

889
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,032
Dinosaur

890
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,080
Taking advantage of

891
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,104
It's really critical

892
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,664
Now the farther you are away from Shipping

893
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,200
The higher the barrier is

894
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,224
Somebody actually

895
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,248
Punching intercredit

896
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:18,624
That's what I said

897
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,000
The less likely to take a chance until

898
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,024
Icantina

899
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,584
Getting a lot of tea are around

900
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,216
I think it's going to be

901
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,752
You're much better than

902
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,056
What you say is he today and

903
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,592
I also would argue with that

904
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,152
Ozarks

905
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,456
Just early.

906
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,808
Give me a sentence for what kind of people not to buy at once

907
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,112
Letterkenny

908
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
So and especially for you

909
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
Cuz hopefully

910
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
30 days

911
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
You know feeling like

912
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
I would probably buy it

913
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,536
Baby products Illinois

914
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
Line-X

915
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,848
Next Bachelor

916
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
Now you're going to be able to order it

917
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:17,760
Going to be there

918
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,552
University within 4 weeks

919
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,880
Yunnan

920
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,696
And

921
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,400
I think traditionally.

922
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,936
But I would

923
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:40,032
Really courage China raise enough money being

924
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,640
I really feel the product get it ready for me facturing

925
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,688

TR

928
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:01,792
Or any of the sort of non-essential things that you would not spend money on

929
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,912
And I think it's

930
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,448
Yourself

931
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,544
How to make some compromises

932
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
We realize it

933
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,088
Commitment time really quick

934
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,880
Way too much pressure on us and

935
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,976
Naughty and I think the cause us to continue with the marketing

936
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
Continue

937
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,560
With a PRN in spending money on things that

938
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,120
You know we really should have just waited on

939
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,408

Church's goodbye

943
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,904
We're still flying lessons as we go

944
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,208
Swelling and I would say

945
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
Real fast for me

946
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,144
What are some of the manufacturing lessons you learned because I know you said something earlier about starting in the USA

947
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,936
And then switching over to China

948
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,240
So do you want to talk briefly about that

949
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,824
Yeah sure

950
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,872
United States

951
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,000
For some of these products

952
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,816
Accessible in United States

953
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,096
And we were working with

954
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:50,848
Need the Nike FuelBand

955
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,407
Tax return

956
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
But

957
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,783
It turns out that

958
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,599
China Inn

959
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,487
Well they're there we have it so

960
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,327
And in Flextronics is a no-name it's not like that's

961
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,887
Like a fly-by-night operation

962
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,471
Exactly

963
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,007
Doing something in China

964
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,079
I think they're wanted if you're using like

965
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:30,015
Entering the facility

966
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
Yes cop Knocks

969
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:38,975
Any of these contract

Button

971
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,679
We realize that

972
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,287
Be better and in the end

973
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,335
Sitting right there in China

974
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,615
Problems

The song

976
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,455

977
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,511
Or anybody please

978
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,839
You really live

979
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,863
Top people

980
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
Sitting on the line

981
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
Watching

982
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,215
And making sure that they're not messing up

983
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Because

984
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
It just would happen

985
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
Attention

986
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,175
Got it all right

987
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:34,527
Chris thank you so much for coming on the show I think we learned a lot about

988
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,575
Building Hardware

989
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:40,927
I'm a little concerned about the future for Innovative Hardware companies now

990
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,535
Hopefully we'll see maybe some smaller runs of interesting products

991
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
And

992
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:53,727
We'll see where that gets us and hopefully a venture capitalist will still be finding them hopefully crazy early adopters like mice

993
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,263
South will still be buying them

994
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
And

995
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:01,151
I look forward to talking to you maybe in a year now that your product has actually coming out and in

996
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:04,223
We'll start seeing some data and we can talk about how

997
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,807
How parenting will change with the internet of things because that is

998
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,367
As a parent something I'm really excited about

999
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,647
Yeah for sure

1000
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,695
Definitely something

1001
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,231
Very excited

1002
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,047
Hopefully

1003
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,327
I can't wait

1004
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,863
Thanks for coming on the show

1005
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,655
Appreciate it

1006
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,215
