00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,520
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:15,104
Does your host Stacey Higginbotham and your co-host

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,968
And today we have a holiday schmorgesborg for you

5
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,016
For your Thanksgiving either

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,064
Restore post restore

7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,880
Black Friday or Cyber Monday or whatever day

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,416
Pick a day any day

9
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,768
So the idea here is Kevin and I are going to talk to you about

10
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,560
Your favorite connected devices

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,120
You should probably consider buying for yourself

12
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,424
Or a loved one for this holiday

13
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,984
Something like that or if you don't like someone

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
We

15
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,056
She might recommend our favorite holiday

16
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,848
Homekit products or a hug

17
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:51,200
In case you really want to give them hours of fun troubleshooting devices

18
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,760
Fun for the whole family setting up a

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,528
Smart home hub

20
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,808
They've gotten a lot better

21
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
Anyways

22
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,624
So we'll get started with the most

23
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,672
I don't know the most common

24
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
Products out there that

25
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,232
Pretty much everyone

26
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,512
Can I join witches

27
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,304
Activity trackers and

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,072
Watches

29
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,144
Kevin this is your neck of the woods tour

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,424
Wrist of the Woods

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
Terrible why do I even do that

32
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,032
What's your recommendation for the best smartwatch out there

33
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,336
Yeah that's it that's a toughie because

34
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,896
I typically wear my Apple watch but it's

35
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,432
Only work with Apple devices

36
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,224
So it's really hard to recommend that

37
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,832
There are obviously some Android Wear watches that do work with Apple and Android phones

38
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
But you know what

39
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,928
If I want to just a basic smartwatch

40
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,720
I didn't want to run a ton of apps

41
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,792
On my wrist which I actually am not doing these days

42
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,352
Probably would take a look at the pebble because it's

43
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,888
Cross platform support

44
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,192
The good battery life and relatively low cost

45
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
Yeah I think the most

46
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616
Recent version which is the round one

47
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
Which is an interesting look

48
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,968
Is 249 at last I checked

49
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
You're buying for one of the

50
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Fair Lady

51
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
And your life

52
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
This is probably a good

53
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
Good option

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,904
Yeah folks who are not familiar with the pebble though I think most

55
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
People probably are

56
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,488
This is the one with the epaper display

57
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
Color now the first

58
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,328
Addition with only a grayscale or black and white

59
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,912
But now their color and Pebble has its new interface called

60
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:21,056
Where the timeline I think they call it timeline where you can see past present and future events and activities and data so

61
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,104
It's really intuitive to use I think and

62
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,944
Even though I said you know if you don't want to run out on your watch this is a good one

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
Pebble still does have an app stores just

64
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,808
It's a relatively Limited in terms of functionality and choice

65
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,112
Yeah I love it I love my puppy

66
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,672
The first gen Pebble that I got for like

67
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,744
Man this was last year around Christmas so I got it for likes

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,536
65 bucks

69
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,864
It runs actually I use it mostly to get my text

70
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
And

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
You can get it for

72
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,264
Actually you can set it up for even emails but I get it mostly protects and taken in

73
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,824
Finding out of my phone's ringing while it's in my back

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
It's great

75
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
And bonus for you or well for Pebble on his but not you because you're not on AT&T just today Pebble added the ability

76
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,296
Do you speak back text replies

77
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,392
But it only works with AT&T phones that's very interesting how they been Limited

78
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,464
You can actually

79
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
Reply back

80
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
With certain predetermined

81
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
Like yes no okay

82
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
Animojis

83
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
I can't tell you how I feel

84
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
Some people are like

85
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
Stacy

86
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,192
Would you like to go you know

87
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,752
Out for happy hour tonight and I respond back with like

88
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
Little wacky emojis

89
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
Some people are like

90
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
I don't understand why you sent me a baseball glove

91
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
It was the closest Emoji to my

92
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
Finger

93
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,760
All right so that's that's our smartwatch

94
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,576
Woke up with the dihybrid catalog

95
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,136
Smartwatch activity tracker

96
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
Because this is

97
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
Both

98
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
Actually we'll just going to activity track

99
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,560
Best activity tracker on the cheap

100
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,352
This is for someone who's like

101
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,680
No not really sold on the concept or maybe they're just like me

102
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,240
I'm going to go with the Jawbone move

103
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
Which is about 50 bucks

104
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
The zip

105
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,616
Would be the equivalent in the Fitbit category

106
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,456
I picked the job on simply because I like the software I think the

107
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
The Jawbone software is

108
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
Darren good and

109
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
I think around for the price I don't think

110
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
No I mean this this thing is

111
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
End

112
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:17,024
I've used a Fitbit I need his jaw bone I use the white things

113
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
I can't think of the white things hacked

114
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
Chevy Tracker thing that they called it

115
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
Andrea Lee

116
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
They all do basically the same thing

117
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,495
I just like the job on software it's

118
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
Nice

119
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
And

120
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,431
The nice thing is is you go up Market in Jawbone if you go up the next level to the Bluetooth equipped up

121
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
In

122
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
3

123
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,575
Whatever ap24 up up

124
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:47,231
You can actually start using your jaw bone to talk to your house so it'll work with your nest and your SmartThings

125
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,607
And you can actually once it sees your moving around in the mornings for example

126
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,727
Let's that awesome let's use as a trigger and

127
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
And start doing some cool stuff

128
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,055
Like center Coffee to go

129
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
Maplewood

130
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
Turn up her desk

131
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
Do other things

132
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
So

133
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
I think that for

134
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
Bang for the buck

135
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
My bad

136
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Competence.

137
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
All right

138
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
And

139
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,903
The intermediate category of

140
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Hey

141
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,975
Smartwatch it's an activity tracker

142
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
It's

143
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,839
Did you actually go or dementia at the Y things activity pop

144
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Yeah

145
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
150 bucks

146
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
I like this device

147
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Vici really do I kind of

148
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
There's a Black Friday deal that widens

149
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
Has tweeted out

150
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,639
This week actually and it's 45% off the activity pop

151
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,431
And I am looking at it and I'm thinking

152
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:45,599
Well you know this is a perfect device for people who want to watch that looks like a watch cuz really that that's what they

153
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,183
That's just has some some smarts inside it and

154
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
A a little

155
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
Counter

156
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
Hand to show you

157
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,559
You know steps and such

158
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,887
I don't know how else to describe it

159
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,215
Circular it's got hands and it's not digital at all it's

160
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
It's analog

161
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
So

162
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,311
It's got the hell tracking stuff in there

163
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,615
It has it has walking running

164
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,663
It's water-resistant so you can

165
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,991
Women and I believe

166
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
Vibration alarm

167
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,831
It's got sleep tracking if you want to sleep in your watch

168
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,903
And it's got a 8-month battery life in his cup

169
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
Bluetooth Bluetooth

170
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,535
Satellite sent the data to the app and you know that's great MI

171
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
Haven't actually checked

172
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,887
To see but I presume it works with both Android and iOS

173
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
I believe so my other wedding stuff

174
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,983
Pass so I assume this out.

175
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,079
So if you're hardcore this isn't going to be for you cuz it doesn't have a heart

176
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,407
So Kevin you want to share your

177
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,735
Your thoughts on for the hardcore Fitness activity tracker guy

178
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:51,135
You could go nuts here on so you can spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars like five six hundred or more I'm actually going to throw a curve

179
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,439
Purple out here that may surprise people

180
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
And say

181
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,303
I would consider the Microsoft Band 2 for $250

182
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:04,191
Now that I own the first one I do not have the second one and the first one was fantastic for me

183
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
Acceptance

184
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
Fit

185
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:11,359
Comfortably the new one is more rounded and looks a lot nicer to wear

186
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
What it has inside those

187
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,223
Actually pretty amazing for such a small band type device

188
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,855
It has an optical heart-rate sensor gotten accelerometer gyroscope GPS which is nice

189
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:26,719
I go out and run I don't have to carry a phone I can have everything track speed distance route and so on

190
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:33,375
Has an ambient light sensor a skin temperature sensor and a UV Central actually tell you hey you've been out in the sun a little too low

191
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Today

192
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,215
It has a capacitive sensor to passive touch screen

193
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Galvanic

194
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
Skin response

195
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
Switch I really never used

196
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,127
Microphone for control and also a barometer

197
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,735
Also has Bluetooth 4.0 so I can wirelessly send or get data

198
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
To and from

199
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:55,135
Not just a Windows phone but also an iPhone or any Android 4.4 better device

200
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,207
2 and fifty bucks 8.8 does a heck of a lot

201
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
What is the galvanic

202
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,631
I guess you know like if I get over radiated by an x-ray or I don't know

203
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,191
I kidding

204
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,543
It might be sweating to be quite honest I don't I don't recall

205
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,079
Oci just usually

206
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
I'm sweating

207
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
Yep galvanic

208
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,991
Skin response is skin conductance

209
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
Interesting thank you Wikipedia

210
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,647
Alright well maybe someone will let us know what that means

211
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,951
Let me actually be something about seizures

212
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
I'll have to I'll have to

213
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:35,839
Keep looking that up I know that their skin bands are bands out there to measure

214
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,887
Like if someone is having a seizure

215
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
Or not

216
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
Feel like I read those words

217
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,263
Near the word seizure

218
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
But

219
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
Again

220
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Google will tell me

221
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,383
Okay this is why

222
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
We should have a medical

223
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,479
We're not we're not doctors we don't play

224
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
It is true

225
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,063
Okay so that is

226
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,391
Those are our picks for wearables activity trackers

227
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
And you can argue with us

228
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
About those later

229
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
Feel free and now will move into

230
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,815
But let's look at the cameras cuz this year

231
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,143
I have gone like a total 180 on the camera front

232
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
We got a lot of

233
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,287
Like smart home devices in like a good half of the things we recommend have cameras in them this

234
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
This year

235
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
There's no hot

236
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,407
No hiding this year for me

237
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,015
All about the security on the outside so

238
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,063
I've got two doorbell cameras

239
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,855
Because this was the year of the

240
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879
Connected door

241
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
Connected doorbell

242
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:37,279
I decided I went into I was in San Francisco last week and I tried out

243
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Two new

244
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,143
Connect two doorbells one is the August doorbell cam

245
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:46,751
I might be the one of the first people who got to see that in their office so

246
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,079
Both of these next devices I have not tried out on my house

247
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,663
Important know that I've only tried them out in their office but I did make them

248
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,967
Taking out the Wi-Fi not working

249
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
Do some test

250
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
So

251
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,807
The August doorbell cam

252
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,623
Works with the August Smart Lock hundred $99

253
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
Of all the doorbell cams

254
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,743
This might be my favorite because it is square in my house is

255
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,327
Rectangular high like the angles on it it's very nice

256
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
It works with your doorbell chime

257
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
It

258
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,727
As actually kind of the most interesting field of view it's actually

259
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,543
Taller than all of the other doorbell cams out on them

260
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Market

261
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
And it takes about

262
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,687
Two to three seconds to get a doorbell feed like the feed going

263
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,503
XM the second you get your notification you pull it up

264
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,087
A little bit faster on your in-home Wi-Fi versus your

265
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
Kind of Lte experience

266
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,183
Good IOS and Android

267
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
And

268
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,511
I deal with August is if you

269
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,351
See someone in your doorbell cam you can be like oh hey UPS man

270
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
What up

271
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:51,519
Please leave that package inside on the door and you open your August lock and then boom the UPS man comes inside your house

272
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
That's why I need one of these

273
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
There you go

274
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
So two hundred bucks

275
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Sketchy one

276
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
Cool thing about it is

277
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
The entire there's like a

278
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
How to say it's about

279
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
Two and a half inch diameter

280
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
Is that the whole part of the circle

281
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Is the diameter

282
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,951
That would be the diameter yet

283
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,511
We are we are not geographers either but

284
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Giai Tri

285
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Geometry

286
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
That's not a word

287
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,375
Okay

288
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
Math majors

289
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
Who started our holiday drinking

290
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:24,287
Early on gravity podcast

291
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
Well that's good you got that one

292
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
Radius is the half

293
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,223
Diameters

294
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
It's a big button

295
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,551
Big button on this thing the hold

296
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
Two and a half

297
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,647
Circle part of the doorbell is the button so

298
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
There is no wrong way to press this

299
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Kind of like

300
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
Very nice

301
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Is the camera quality

302
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
He is very good

303
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Pretty good mode

304
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
So that's August

305
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
And

306
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
I like that because

307
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Because of the design of

308
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
Set for my house

309
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
Now

310
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
The other doorbell

311
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
That we have

312
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
Connected video doorbell cam

313
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
Is

314
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
The skybell HD

315
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
Now this isn't going to go on sale

316
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,063
Until December 16th on the skybell website so right now it's sold out do not be fooled by the Skype

317
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,623
Adele version to that's on the website right now

318
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,183
Wait for the skybell HD

319
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
As you can imagine this is HD

320
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,535
And this thing is really nice

321
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
It is a round doorbell

322
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
It has

323
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,911
Couple really interesting features

324
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,239
It's got LEDs that are customizable on the outside

325
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,567
So you can change like the little lights on the outside of the doorbell

326
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,359
To be like whatever color you want

327
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,711
You can like your Hue bulbs exactly like your Hue bulbs actually

328
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:42,367
So for Christmas you can have them be red and white or red and green knows I'm probably only only one color one color only

329
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
Red grid

330
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,463
You can actually turn off the chime if you'd like to

331
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,791
And then it will just send you notifications to your phone

332
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
This is nice if you have you know

333
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
A baby or dog like mine that's just like

334
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,471
Oh my God the door I got a burnt my fool head off

335
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
And

336
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,055
It has a really nice

337
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
Wide angle of view

338
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
And it has

339
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
Full color night vision

340
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,943
Those LEDs I was talking about

341
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,735
Yeah they let off enough

342
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,551
Light at night even when it's pitch-black

343
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,415
Owl camera can actually see you in full color really well it's

344
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
Pretty slick

345
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:22,047
That's impressive I have a couple webcams that use like i r type lighting to

346
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
Can I do that

347
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
But they're not great

348
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,959
And it's interesting to me they're using regular LEDs and what not that's that's impressive

349
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
This is I mean

350
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
If book

351
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
So those two

352
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,383
Each of them or both of them or 199

353
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
So

354
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,943
That's $200 not $2

355
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,063
Probably not going to be on sale since they're both so new

356
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,855
I'm guessing they're going to be pretty hot

357
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
Pretty hot items

358
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
So go doorbells

359
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:54,815
Alright Kevin I feel like I've been talking a long time why don't I send it back to you and you can talk about

360
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Arlo

361
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,423
Arlo Arlo Auto that's a wireless

362
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,519
Camera security system you can get in multiple configurations so if you just want to like

363
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
One doorbell cam like I want

364
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
You can do that

365
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:11,199
Or you can get multiple cameras that come in the kids all up like five cameras included

366
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
And then there's add-on cameras if you want even

367
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,063
Keep it running in a really that got your home

368
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,391
But the kid actually comes to the base station as well as a camera

369
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:25,279
And the lowest price one if you buy it direct is 17999 for the base station

370
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,839
And 1 wireless camera with an HD camera

371
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,423
I does have night vision it's an indoor outdoor cameras weatherproof

372
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
It's completely wireless menu.

373
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Plug it in either

374
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,799
The base station is plugged in obviously but the camera

375
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
Has batteries in it

376
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,871
Comes with batteries so

377
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,431
You can mount it outside and not worry about it till the batteries

378
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
Are dead

379
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,807
If you do go on to Amazon right now you can get this for a hundred fifty bucks

380
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
And that's

381
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,415
Probably a much better deal or save yourself $30 there

382
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,791
So the base station would obviously be in your house somewhere connected to your network and then you have your camera outdoor so

383
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:04,447
I don't know in terms of functionality if it's as robust as maybe some of the other ones that you were talking about prior like enough about notifications inside

384
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
So you can get notifications on this thing

385
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
Arlo

386
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
Is Netgear

387
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,663
This isn't the camera itself doesn't

388
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
Talk to anything yet

389
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:21,087
I talked to the SmartThings guys and their kind of ion the stuff they're like oh that's that's a nice-looking camera

390
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
All right now Arlo doesn't

391
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
The Netgear guys

392
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
They've told me that

393
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
For now are those

394
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Is closed system

395
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
So my hope

396
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,863
Because you know how much I hate things that don't talk to other things

397
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,191
Is it our love will open itself out cuz man

398
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,495
I would love to be able to pull

399
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
There's not a lot of great quality

400
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Outdoor IP

401
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
He cameras

402
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
You know

403
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
Out there

404
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
I would love to be able to pull this

405
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Into

406
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,527
Some of my other kind of home hub systems

407
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
Cuz I

408
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,135
You know I got a rooftop deck and I would love to be able to

409
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
See who's up there

410
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
1

411
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
Safety but to

412
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,071
If you like leave something up there

413
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
It is really a panda

414
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
The climb up all those stairs

415
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
To go like

416
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
Just check the roof so you could be like hey dude

417
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,543
Do I need anything up there no

418
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,895
That's just me being lazy again which is the primary reason to install Smart Home

419
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
X-ray

420
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
Okay

421
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
So

422
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
That concludes the

423
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,343
The spying on people portion of the crisp

424
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
Gift guide of the holiday gift guide

425
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
Let's go to

426
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Light bulbs

427
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
What's your favorite light bulb

428
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
Doesn't have to be the same as

429
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,607
Kevin Ware back to you so I don't have a light bill this year

430
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Because

431
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
I frankly I'm not really

432
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,239
Super stoked about any of the ones that I've tried

433
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:47,871
There's there's some new lightbulbs coming down the pike but they're not here yet so until they get here

434
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
I haven't found anything the only thing I really like

435
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:55,295
Enjoyous / are the Hue wireless light bulbs

436
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,439
Right and those were $99

437
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,767
They don't really actually tie and any of the other systems

438
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
Right now

439
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,095
And they're just fun

440
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
I'm kind of too expensive

441
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
Pics of a great gift I guess but

442
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,495
Sit there handy cuz you can put them anywhere in the house

443
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,799
Scannow anywhere you need to let you just put this bowl and

444
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Flip the switch and

445
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
You good

446
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Yep

447
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,687
Which I know is your thing

448
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
So

449
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,551
I'm less of a changing color kind of guy so that's why my favorite

450
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
Bald this year

451
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,647
Is the osram lightify bulbs

452
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
See I've got a couple of them in here I have

453
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
Also the Hues I got the

454
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
A couple trees and some other dogs

455
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,607
I like the Oz rooms they're a little more expensive than a typical white

456
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
LED bulb

457
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
But there's a reason for that

458
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:49,567
It's because they can be tuned to any color temperature from 2800 kelvins all the way up to will over 65

459
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,359
Hunter Calvin so what that means is

460
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
If you want a soft white

461
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
Yellowish light

462
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,991
You can do that with his balls you can tune the color down

463
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,831
If you want to bright white you can tune the color up a little bit more

464
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
You want daylight

465
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,183
Crank It Up you got full daylight

466
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
You can also dim this

467
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,023
You just can't change the color itself

468
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
White

469
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Or

470
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
White

471
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
But how much are they

472
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,471
Well they go for about $30 and that's a lot for a white LED bulb

473
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,263
You know it's the heuiser

474
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,847
Probably little bit more but you can have any color practically up in the Spectrum

475
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,711
70 * 30 bucks they work with SmartThings with the wink hub

476
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,271
And if you have either of those who actually work

477
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
Through an Amazon Echo as well

478
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,135
And do they come and BR30 S&A 19th

479
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,231
I have the a 19th I think they come in for your 30s

480
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,047
All right maybe maybe I'll go

481
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
Usher

482
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:48,447
BR30 Obsession BR30 is are the big flat lights that you stick in Tennessee

483
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
The cans in a 19 with a tip

484
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
Typical

485
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Light bulb shapes

486
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
Just for the people out there who

487
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,407
Like myself a few years ago did not

488
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,687
Speak fluent light bulb

489
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,527
Razorsync zigbee by the way so they work

490
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
With the Beast

491
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Excellent

492
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,159
All right so that's are those are a lightbulb

493
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,439
Recommendations

494
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,999
And let us go now to

495
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,303
Hold let's go to my favorite room in the house

496
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
The kitchen

497
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,375
Which is where I keep my

498
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
Amazon Echo

499
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,775
Yeah so we've already talked about the Amazon Echo there's really no more to say

500
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
Except for

501
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
This last week

502
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,663
If you didn't have enough reasons to spend a hundred and seventy-nine

503
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,247
99 on the Amazon Echo to give it to someone you love this week

504
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,087
They announced and if this then that integration that's a little bit more complete

505
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:42,207
And so now you can actually connect the echo to your nest and you can actually tell it

506
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:47,583
Turn your desk tan without resorting to some sort of janky hack where you inside like

507
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,631
Your shopping list to your nest

508
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,679
Stinnett will turn it to 72 degrees

509
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
When you say

510
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,495
Add something to my shopping list

511
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
And that will make that

512
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
One thing happen

513
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,127
Now you can just tell it to turn your nest to 70

514
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Degrees in

515
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Boom

516
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,247
I've been using that new functionality ever since it came out

517
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
The past couple days

518
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
Love it absolutely love it

519
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
What's your favorite

520
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,183
Are the nice one that's the only one I'm using so far I haven't gotten

521
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
Around like making more triggers and whatnot but

522
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,303
You can do so many more things now because of this new trigger command

523
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,375
That was the one thing I was like missing from my my echo

524
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
I really wanted

525
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
Turn on the nest

526
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
And so now do you

527
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,031
I guess cuz you got an iPhone now that you're using

528
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,079
So you don't use the OK Google

529
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
Command anymore

530
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
No

531
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,455
At mostly is in my iPhone these days

532
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,759
Yeah I mean I could try the OK Google stuff too

533
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,551
National very easily but no

534
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,647
It's I'd rather I mostly my office and that's where the echo is

535
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,183
So boom

536
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,023
Every time we have the right we talked about the echo so many times in the past year

537
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,815
I think there's a good reason for it

538
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,375
It's a very compelling product for the price

539
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,655
And it keeps getting better

540
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,471
It does just go buy one already my goodness

541
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
We're just not going to let you

542
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
Put it down if you don't

543
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,847
So one thing I will tell you

544
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,383
To not purchase

545
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,431
For people you love this holiday season

546
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,991
I'm going to recommend you don't go

547
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
In on homekit stuff

548
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
Just yet

549
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
If you want to update your

550
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
Philips Hue Bridge

551
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,696
You've only got a couple more weeks before that discount

552
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
Runs Out

553
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
Remember

554
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,328
How to upgrade your Philips Hue how have you better go to the Philips Hue website

555
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,144
Cogat basically the Philips Hue upgraded

556
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,192
Hub for $40

557
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,240
Instead of $60 on that

558
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
Device

559
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,824
You got to do it before like the end of this month

560
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,384
Or while supplies last

561
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,480
I'm probably going to do it on a Feeling on the fence about it cuz the phone

562
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,296
The last time I tried out the review Persian

563
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,856
Bro, Integrations and I hated it

564
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
Yeah but

565
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
I got to do it

566
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
What's my job

567
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
For normal people

568
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
If you're not

569
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,048
You know if you're kind of on the fence about the Hub

570
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
You know

571
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,400
If you're basically like I wish I could go buy some more homekit stuff

572
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,448
Wait just wait

573
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:05,824
We've been waiting and I agree with you I think people should probably keep waiting

574
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,640
So if you don't have to move on it don't move on it

575
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,992
You're sitting on the fence on the Hub and you can afford waiting for 20 more dollars

576
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,528
You might as well

577
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,344
But if you're like $20 that's like

578
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
A fifth of a gadget

579
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,440
That's big money for me Stacy

580
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
Well

581
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
All right that's almost a light bulb

582
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
It is almost over how sad are we

583
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
So

584
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,888
And you know

585
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,680
If you're sitting there looking for

586
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Toys

587
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,496
I'm going to recommend to microduino

588
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,800
We talked about them a couple episodes ago

589
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,360
I still love them you can get a starter pack

590
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,408
Microduino site for 99 bucks

591
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
They work with Legos

592
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
Their lair

593
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,248
Arduinos

594
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,272
The sensors

595
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
The work with Legos

596
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
What's not to love about that

597
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
I agree

598
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,136
There's also little bits

599
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,928
You know the cloud that's are great

600
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,024
They also have starter packs that start at $99

601
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:03,680
Perfect for kids I am going to get for my daughter a drop kitchen scale because I didn't get her one for her birthday

602
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,472
Still haven't heard the end of it

603
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,752
This was in August

604
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:10,080
My bad and drop did add cocktails to their mix

605
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
So

606
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,456
I can now make cocktails on the scale and

607
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
I think

608
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248
Let's see

609
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Hennything

610
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,320
House on the connected device front that were like

611
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
Excited about

612
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,232
I'm so you know what you know what it's not that far away from generous Consumer Electronics Show so I have a feeling

613
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
Febrile

614
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
Satellites look forward to

615
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Man there's so many

616
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
Cool device

617
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
What is coming out

618
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
I mean

619
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Guys

620
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
I'm even like

621
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,472
Things coming down the pike that are like

622
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
A lot smarter

623
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:43,360
Algorithms going nuts here we're going to see like next year

624
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,176
Doing the show like in 3 months

625
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,992
I would have a whole new class of devices

626
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
Is that I'd be like

627
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
Wow

628
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,576
They just cost a lot more

629
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,880
Where can I hold off

630
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
And

631
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,464
That's pretty much it I think so

632
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
Stuff your faces

633
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
Go shopping

634
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,096
Connect activity tracker and workout for dinner

635
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Yes

636
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Yes

637
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,472
That's probably the most mature class of devices we have out there

638
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
And

639
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
We will see you

640
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
After the holidays

641
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
Just

642
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,896
I think after this one

643
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
Yes

644
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
Isis like oh my gosh

645
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,504
Leaving for a month

646
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,296
No we are not will be back

647
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Lucky you

648
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
All right

649
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:31,488
And there is no guess this week because we wanted you to enjoy your holidays and start your shopping so get on that

650
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:37,888
