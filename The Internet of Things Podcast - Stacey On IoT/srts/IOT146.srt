00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,144
Yes it's weird

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,960

Smart bathroom

34
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720

This week sponsor is CBT Nuggets

44
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,112
How does the IRT change the way we do business for many organizations that have devices in tools

45
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,512
Does devices require support request for the ITT or a pile of devices that

46
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,352
Start being used to their full potential

47
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,752

We're going to catch kevin mitchell

55
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,704
Let's talk about that

56
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,848
This point is the question because I'm seeing

57
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,944
Google and Amazon voice Services being put into anything and everything

58
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
New devices

59
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,504
Partners

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
Google is here

61
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
Every billboard

62
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,464
Monorails that had a nice display over at

63
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,912
NC is much Amazon

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,384
I seen Amazon's obviously they also have

65
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
They had a giant

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
To display we like

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,368
Gumball machine

68
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
Upstream

69
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,744
Having a game with people using Google Assistant

70
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
Show

71
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,632
Just make sure that they're in the conversation

72
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,800
House Outdoors at Las Vegas

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
Shut down

74
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
So what we seeing

75
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,040
Matinee is going to be in

76
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
The exciting for anybody

77
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
I would actually

78
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
Garmin is also showing awesome

79
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,952
Prada Supreme

80
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,839
Add on straight into the car

81
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,863
I would still like it

82
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
It seems like a lot of

83
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,031
Voice Services position as Solutions

84
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
4

85
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
Car manufacturer example

86
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
Just an all-in-one solution

87
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
Which of the Samsung company

88
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
Shut off their vision and

89
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
It wasn't you the voices

90
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
You just messing

91
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439
Alright let's talk about Bixby

92
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,511
Because I mean other than I should say we talked

93
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
People

94
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
In one of the things I found really interesting

95
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:57,471
That the retail channel so the Best Buy's of the world are actually asking smart

96
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Homemakers

97
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Adwerx

98
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Shelf space that way

99
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,455
And so if you don't have that

100
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
They're kind of like

101
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
Which I thought was pretty

102
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,855
Not smart because

103
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
Consumers are in the Best Buy in LA

104
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,535
System test taking time away from something else that person

105
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,863
EXO

106
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,727
Packaging that explains all this

107
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
Yes and

108
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
It's basically ended the standard

109
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,431
Forever

110
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,991
Nobody cares if it works with Madam

111
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
So like we said

112
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
Seaford over all of that underlines

113
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
We're done with that you guys

114
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,095
Is a lot more work for

115
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,215
Honeywell integrating with whirlpool

116
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,775
And getting these like silly features

117
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
Custom integration

118
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,895
Tens device by device

119
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,831
They're everywhere

120
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,415
Talk about Samsung

121
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,375
You and I were at the Samsung president

122
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
3 years ago

123
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,751
Laughing a lot

124
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,359
It was precy at 3 Oliver coyote craziness it was right after the Bots

125
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,407
And oh my gosh

126
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
Everything

127
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Work together

128
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
Do you remember what it was

129
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255
Did you hear anything

130
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
Mention

131
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
In the Press event

132
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
45

133
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
And I would say

134
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
35 minute timer

135
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
Very different

136
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
For us and our listeners

137
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
SmartThings

138
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Bixby

139
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,671
So it seems to me and I have not been able to

140
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,231
Samsung

141
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,727
And you know what good for them for realizing it when they have

142
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Netflix.

143
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
Stihl brand

144
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
And that's what it was

145
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
They are

146
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,271
Coming out with things on their watches

147
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
Which I think is

148
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,911
Great for them and make it award

149
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,055
They probably will because

150
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:18,431
Message. And other people

151
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
Washers that still work

152
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,551
I would expect them to you as well my take on it is

153
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
If it works with smart

154
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,855
Things today

155
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
It still will work on forward

156
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
I don't think they're going to

157
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
Limit.

158
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
Underlying

159
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
Federer

160
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,631
Did not know it was another thing I was waiting for them to

161
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
But that's good

162
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,799
As consumers don't care about that you know

163
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
Everett tweakers

164
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
I just want to

165
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
You think together

166
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
And that was really promising to hear

167
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,343
I mentioned Bixby in the car that has Harmon showing of 13

168
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
Autonomous cars

169
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
Disable Bixby

170
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
Drive me to 7 South

171
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,791
Their clients as well they showed their start fresh again

172
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
Expedient

173
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,167
It would recognize two different people voices together different morning briefing

174
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,215
Stop that we have with others

175
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
Nice to see them

176
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
War

177
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991
Because I'm a

178
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
Industrial iot

179
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
Memes

180
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,439
You guys are like what

181
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
These are basically like analog

182
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,071
The Internet of Things

183
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,311
So they had

184
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
Really low

185
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
Power accelerometer

186
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
But this guy

187
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
Microwatts

188
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,319
Which is so small

189
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
Tracking

190
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,375
Instead of using magnets

191
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
So you start

192
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
See you later

193
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,919
It's not just what the sensor measures but also like

194
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
Inference

195
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,087
Really. So I'm excited to see what people might

196
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
That's the other thing that I thought it was

197
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Wicked cool

198
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
Was they have a memes

199
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,255
What is

200
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,655
Zoom in and out with a projector HD

201
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
How to do it

202
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,871
And it's small enough

203
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,407
30

204
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
7

205
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Millimeter

206
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,807
Fit inside like an Amazon Echo

207
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,135
Semiconductor

208
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Because they

209
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
Chauffeur

210
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
New display

211
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
Especially when

212
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
Z-Wave

213
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
Z-Wave ships out there I should talk to

214
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,591
They offer

215
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
Your battery life

216
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
Z-Wave sensor

217
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
So awesome

218
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
Used

219
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
You can color better managers sleep basic

220
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
So those are coming out

221
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Andrea

222
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,047
Crazy low-power in r

223
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
And speaking of Z

224
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:02,431
Which I really like that does like my WeMo Insight switch to your energy

225
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
We also have a USB

226
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
Something else

227
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,855
So I don't have to go by the

228
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
Not only that but

229
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
Energy

230
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
Drawn that us

231
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
Sbarro

232
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,263
It got me thinking about

233
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,311
Use cases for

234
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
Devices

235
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
But when

236
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
You turn on your

237
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,807
Bedroom light in the morning if your lamp

238
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
Waking up before the sun comes up

239
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,927
Power draw that's now being modern

240
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Good morning

241
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:51,071
I never thought of using power fluctuation as

242
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Everything in my

243
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,079
They don't like using voice that's fine

244
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,879
I do I do

245
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
His voice is not the right contacts at 1

246
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
Good morning

247
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
I know she's not a new

248
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,167
Probably going to be tomorrow

249
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
Jester

250
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,591
Describe that a little bit better so what is the fibaro gesture thing Hill

251
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,175
I forget the exact it looks like a small

252
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
Picture frame

253
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,343
Just Chester like the other four stroke oil it uses

254
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,183
Some kind of radio waves and by using your hand

255
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,535
And that's how it knows what the gesture is I think is about 6 different chest

256
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,607
Swipe the magic

257
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,167
Albus White

258
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Because that

259
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
Situation

260
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:11,455
Whatever is going to sleep you know I tell that I made a gym

261
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
I can just

262
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,295
Wave my hand over this thing one way and dim the lights

263
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
I can

264
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
It is also

265
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
Howard or white

266
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,167
Because that leads into where I might actually put it

267
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:35,007
I may I have a little

268
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,639
This actually works to wake up to an inch of almost any

269
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:51,135
I just literally wave my hand one of six different ways over my little table and

270
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,023
I need to get out of the voices for everything

271
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Because it is

272
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,911
Exactly and that's why I took

273
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
Coveted

274
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
The challenge

275
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
Doesn't work

276
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
Call hubs

277
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,407
Right we did chat about that

278
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,991
If you're going to use for bar prices

279
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
Probably better off

280
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
With a SmartThings Hub

281
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,279
USB device anyway

282
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
Which has three different options

283
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,655
Shoes that just came out

284
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
D-box

285
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Sbarro

286
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,615
In your house

287
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
I think Evans

288
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:50,527
Check this out homework for Kevin it's been awhile it's been awhile

289
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,463
All right

290
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
Hbase is

291
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
Skybell is

292
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
Ring for patent

293
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,863
Frenchman on video doorbell

294
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,471
I feel like this year 2018 is going to be

295
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,823
2

296
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
We all need to get to

297
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
What year

298
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
You're probably a start sooner

299
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
Scribe

300
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
So this is

301
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
Not surprising

302
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
First loss

303
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,415
They're suing them over their security system

304
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,511
Stole some ideas from them

305
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
Tired vazzana

306
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,215
This actually reminds me of the Apple Samsung lawsuit

307
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
You know I

308
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
Let's be honest

309
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,407
Anybody here

310
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
As I look at this from

311
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
Video doorbell as

312
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
Scott

313
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,343
Chicano speaker wiring

314
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
Speaker

315
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
I just hate to see this

316
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
I'm with you

317
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
Okay

318
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
Look at you

319
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
Text more in this market

320
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
PetSmart

321
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Bathroom

322
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,695
This is an extension of the smart kitchen so

323
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
One of the coolest things

324
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
Is a

325
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,351
Delta faucet Kohler also excuse the feature to

326
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
And

327
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
Jackson talks to matamata

328
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,727
Cast metal

329
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,775
Turn on my faucet which

330
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,335
Could be handy but it's probably not that great

331
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
You can also tell if

332
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
Feel something up

333
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,479
2 cups of water in it and it'll just dispense that

334
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,783
Stun

335
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,087
To fill up so like I have a big spaghetti pot

336
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,647
Spaghetti pie

337
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,743
Oh my spaghetti pie

338
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
That will happen

339
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
So this

340
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
Is awesome I'm sorry you guys

341
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
Is super awesome

342
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
Because these are like

343
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
Intelligence

344
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Remote connectivity

345
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,639
So color also

346
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,223
Makeup mirror with a

347
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
Feel like shower something

348
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,439
The smart bathroom which I'm not actually sure I'm ready

349
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,023
Ready or not

350
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
Let's

351
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583

Schlage

Maker of electronic locks

357
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,847
Schlage electronic locks off

358
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
On their own

359
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,455

Hey iot podcast

366
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
So I have a question

367
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:19,935
Actually the market to buy my first home and finally stopped print

368
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
And I was wondering what

369
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,055
Kind of iot solutions should I be looking at

370
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,359
Kind of an iot Lube right now

371
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,175
Basically I'm just still into the

372
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
Anime

373
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
Some with

374
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,063
Echo that I was gifted and

375
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,879
29 Echo dot Black Friday deal

376
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,183
Other than that I'm not really interested

377
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
I was wondering

378
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
Where should I start looking and start doing my research

379
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
Two iot of Phi my house

380
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
Also

381
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,959
My real estate agent got me thinking when he was talking about one of his former clients

382
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,775
That had moisture sensors in the bathroom

383
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
So when the Marshall ever got

384
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,615
Hi it would automatically turn on the vent

385
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
I was wondering

386
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
Are there sensors that

387
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
Can determine

388
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
Almost like a

389
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,855
The stinkiness level ntaganda fan to vent out the smell

390
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
Just wondering

391
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
Love the podcast

392
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:19,327
Okay Kyle that wasn't a different direction that I thought I was ready for like hey I've got an anime in what do I buy it

393
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,935
Interesting use case

394
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,983
Smarter we always suggest starting with e

395
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Please case

396
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,079
A couple different ways

397
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,871
And we can partially stop it

398
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,687
Another way

399
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Right there are

400
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,831
There are bathroom fans that has built-in sensors

401
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
Running until

402
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,927
Humidity level drops

403
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,791
That's a non-smart

404
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
Doesn't communicate with anything other than

405
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,215
I'm going so you could do that

406
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
Home Depot

407
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,359
I thought we put it in

408
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,711
Probably want to get a switch

409
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
Wifi switch would probably

410
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
Just Finance

411
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,647
Tp-link make slime soda

412
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
Spine

413
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,304
And

414
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,656
Like there's plenty of humidity sensors

415
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,216
As far as smell sensors that's a little tricky

416
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,008
Yes so

417
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,824
Kevin and I had a lively debate over

418
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
What makes a bath

419
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,176
Consensus appears to be

420
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,224
Hydrogen sulfide

421
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040
And I was thinking about you as well

422
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,624
No no

423
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
You know I was talking

424
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,464
Actually someone from

425
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,512
And they actually had in a where

426
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,560
AWA

427
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
Sensor

428
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,120
Next to their cat litter box

429
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,448
They would trigger an apple

430
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
Turn on the smart outlet

431
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,360
The concepts are similar shows some sense

432
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,432
We just Alaska measure vocs

433
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,736
I don't know if hydrogen sulfide is a Voca

434
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
You can buy a Hydra

435
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,064
Gas sniffer for like

436
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,928
Internet status

437
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,000
It doesn't feel like something

438
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
Be excited about

439
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
If you guys

440
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
Anyconnect

441
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
Nobody advertisers

442
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,680
This particular

443
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
Teacher

444
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
Market

445
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
Worst case scenario

446
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
Smart Switch

447
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
Could always do

448
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
Do something where

449
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
Seether Set It Off

450
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
With a motion detection

451
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
Stop

452
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,856
Determine what that time is that

453
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
Or

454
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
$30 bottle of

455
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488
Which is

456
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:59,584
Recommendation this is a little

457
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
Into the toilet

458
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,888
Chris is oil film on top

459
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
Trade It

460
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
Actually

461
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
There is a

462
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
Really big

463
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,848
So if you didn't want to connect

464
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
Lowe's for your

465
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,176
Humidity sensing fan

466
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,248
Your grocery checkout aisle

467
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,320
A little vial of free

468
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,928
As far as other things for a new house and just getting started I think

469
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:29,024
You don't have to do more switches unless you want to

470
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
In a thermostat

471
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,936
Should you get certain thermostats Plus

472
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,360
Caesar detected in your home

473
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
So

474
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
Birds with one

475
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
All right

476
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
Tocayo

477
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,552
Thanks for calling

478
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,832
And again

479
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
60

480
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,672
7 4

481
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,976
And now

482
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
Conversation

483
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,304
Simon segars

484
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,376
The CEO of arm

485
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:11,776
Hey everyone we're taking a break from this week's iot podcast from our sponsor this week

486
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,592
Lux products we have robbed

487
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:20,224
Here to talk about thermostat

488
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,272
And how it works in the smartphone

489
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
So Rob

490
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,576
Can you tell her

491
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,600
A little bit

492
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
We are a

493
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,464
Proud bunch of philadelphia-based innovators of

494
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
HVAC

495
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Controls

496
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,048
We've been around for over a hundred years

497
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,328
Our most recent launch

498
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:39,168
The Lux Kono smart thermostat is a product chock-full of

499
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
Smart features it has

500
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,776
At the core element with Decor snap cover so it can match

501
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,848
Any environment and it works with all the voice assist

502
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,712
Which is a pretty competitive price

503
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,808
Animation was a big deal at CES this year

504
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:59,136
Bunch of devices we're still focused on

505
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,952
A big thing was everything that had to work with one another

506
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
How did you guys attack

507
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,304
We stay in the channel that were in

508
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
Sandwiches

509
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
HVAC

510
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,656
And so we know that we have to be able to come

511
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
Communicate

512
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
With all the major voice

513
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
Assistance

514
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,520
Because we view that as the

515
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,312
The glue of the Smart Home

516
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
So

517
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,128
Coming out of the gate we have the big three

518
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
Google Apple and Amazon

519
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,784
We work seamlessly with those so we can be part of each of those ecosystem

520
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,112
And right now you guys offer three generations of Kinect

521
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
Two products

522
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,416
How do each of those fit

523
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,696
Within the home automation

524
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,232
That's a great question

525
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
We started our

526
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,840
Smart thermostats with the Lux Geo in 2015

527
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,888
And it's feature is that it is

528
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,448
Battery operated Wi-Fi products

529
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
So it works off of

530
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
2 lithium

531
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:51,360
Double a batteries or of course with the famous C wire and

532
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,640
Parnu power Bridge

533
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,944
Which makes it have connectivity forever and ever

534
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,016
Second generation was more of a pro product

535
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,552
We called the g o x

536
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
And that has

537
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,624
Superior humidification

538
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Control

539
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
And of course the most recent

540
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,464
Our third generation is

541
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,256
Dacono smart and

542
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,536
We've just launched the

543
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Kono

544
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,376
Smart zigbee version which weave Julie named

545
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
Konigsee

546
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
Excellent

547
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:21,056
Having all of this experience what are some things that you think manufacturers need to

548
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
To remember

549
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
Moon embracing the Sun

550
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,920
What are the things that we differentiate on

551
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,456
For the Hub basis

552
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,016
I'm with or zigbee product is that we

553
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,808
Are a thermostat company

554
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,832
May 1st

555
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:39,488
So when we designed or zigbee product for the hubs we made sure that you happen to lose connectivity to the hub

556
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,888
You're still going to have your thermostat working on a schedule keeping the house comfortable and even if you had

557
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,168
Two for those devices

558
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,824
You can put a schedule in at the wall on the device which is something that other people that are in the smart products

559
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
Business first

560
00:26:55,104 --> 00:27:01,248
Thermostat 2nd don't think about we've been through this a lot for the past 30 years we have over 15 million

561
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,064
Thermostats on the wall we know exactly what to do.

562
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
Keep the home com

563
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,880
Alright Rob that sounds great

564
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,672
Where can we go to find out

565
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,976
What we'd love to have everyone come to Lux

566
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:17,376
Products.com there's plenty to read there and if you want to learn more about the Kono smart thermostat you can stop by your

567
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,776
Local Home Depot store or shop online

568
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:31,712
Everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

569
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,992
Who is the CEO of

570
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,064
Our assignment how are you doing today

571
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,416
I'm so excited and as you guys all know

572
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,696
I love semiconductors

573
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
I love Arm

574
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:48,096
It'll make semiconductors they just make the brains the instruction set and then the license about every

575
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
So in my brain

576
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,192
Simon knows everything that's going to happen

577
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
For the next 5 years

578
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:04,224
I like to think that's the way we was way we develop a technology that way we were upon us

579
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,576
Us to have some insight of where at least of all the processing you've got

580
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,160
Can you snort see devices

581
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:16,768
CSG seeing exactly what everybody else with the technology

582
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,816
You think about the supply chain with rain

583
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:25,216
Developing processes and everything else people used to build chips we license them to chip companies they design those into

584
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,752
Play put the rain stop around it

585
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:31,616
He's on it into an end product eventually get ships that is a really long time gap between

586
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:36,736
Ostomy. Especially in the very early days of new technologies and it ending up in a real Pro

587
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:41,088
You make it sound like a takes a long time but it's actually gotten a lot shorter so

588
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,416
Point in time that you guys start designing a chip for your

589
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,976
Oh my gosh I think we need voice recognition

590
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,768
How long do those

591
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,560
Jimmy Walker audience may not be

592
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,608
This process through house

593
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,168
If we are

594
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
Thinking about

595
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,520
New architectural features then that's fine from

596
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:04,384
First thing about what we might need two products shipping in a store that you can actually go by

597
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,176
Could be Chinese

598
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:11,552
Play Somebody architectural features that all shipping now in smartphones by small V8 technology

599
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
Another word come that happens

600
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
Probably 10 years ago

601
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,416
So in some places

602
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
Light radiates how long time

603
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:22,816
Thinking about maybe it's Origins on top of that specific

604
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,584
Processes

605
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,376
4 different Performance Point

606
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
Applications

607
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,472
If that can be for male product concept 2

608
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
A ship

609
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:34,080
Products can be anything from to use to

610
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,616
4 years

611
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,176
It is you guys must be really smart

612
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,456
Having to take about this stuff

613
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,504
Let's think about

614
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
You and I first met

615
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
ORD a half years ago when

616
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,856
Chicago CEO job

617
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,256
When I asked you what you were excited about what you're going to do next week

618
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:57,376
Internet servers and you didn't really give me much more than that so

619
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,168
Looking back on that now

620
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
Do you recognize that is like a transition

621
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
. what did

622
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,520
You guys where do you guys see our

623
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,568
I see what you look like that.

624
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:09,152
And if you took to anyone in this kind of semiconductor industry

625
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,760
Huge amount of semen

626
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
Comes in

627
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,832
Huge amount of R&D huge amount of economic value

628
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,928
The growth rates for mobile was going to slow down

629
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,720
Everyone was thinking about snakes

630
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,256
And it really wasn't clear and

631
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,560
Yeah I talked to a lot of CGI was in this industry

632
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,632
Franklin

633
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,424
Now United

634
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
That the

635
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,984
Technologies of iot

636
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,312
The price is incapabilities Academy nivel artificial intelligence

637
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
These are

638
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,152
Cherokee building blocks that can get deployed in Lutsen

639
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Different wines weather

640
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,968
Self-driving cars

641
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
Recognizing your voice and ordering

642
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,344
Pizza for you or making the lights in the room go off a few

643
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,184
Workout

644
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,256
So I've learned looking

645
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,328
Had this idea that these Technologies would going to be useful

646
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,264
We starting to see the first deployments of them in

647
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
Real products

648
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,824
I think we just going to Seymour MO

649
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,872
So some of the features that

650
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:12,896
We talked about

651
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:16,224
I don't know if this has Hardware implications for you guys

652
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
Voice

653
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,528
Computer vision

654
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,808
Which I feel is still kind of early

655
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,856
Machine learning at the edge

656
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,416
What else is there

657
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,952
There's some communication

658
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,280
Everything is low power

659
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:35,680
Hear what we're trying to do is cry Wolfe Ali I'd like to either and when you went to Gracie that was really well together a suspicion is that

660
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
Energy efficient

661
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
Teen memory in the Danbury Mall pal

662
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,152
Black people forget together

663
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,992
Integrated technology

664
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,344
Is Seattle a few years we've seen things like voice

665
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
Things like visions.

666
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,416
Yum yum application

667
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,440
Want to use because it said

668
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
Cancel them

669
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,864
There are new features that we need to develop you look at the algorithms using to to machine

670
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,912
Learning processes

671
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,752
Run them prices for the Run even more efficiently and other types of

672
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,544
Accelerator new starting to CP

673
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,592
Boston Market

674
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:19,712
People using gpus Bigler developing a custom acceleracers

675
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,016
This whole Space is very alive at the moment because he's

676
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,320
You the hours of the changing the oven

677
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,600
Being developed

678
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
And I think you know

679
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,672
Cigarette another phone off use time

680
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,976
Yeah you look at all of these Technologies

681
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
We producing

682
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,304
It will be addressing in a little

683
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,376
Okay it was me

684
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,656
Just a moment ago

685
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,216
You guys are recent just by SoftBank

686
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
And massage

687
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:49,152
Has this big vision for a trillion connected devices everywhere

688
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
You doing

689
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,968
Vision board

690
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,576
What Master is doing with the SoftBank group is creating a an ecosystem

691
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
Square

692
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,416
Really want to lose them all together is Taissa

693
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:06,048
Investments that they making their businesses which can use data to glean insights for the Racine

694
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,840
How people use Office Space how people

695
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
Omega rounds

696
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,704
Status is going to be guided by

697
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
Iot devices is going to be

698
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,032
Leaves across the network

699
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
Process

700
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
Some of that in the age of Summer

701
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
The Clown

702
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
The network

703
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,408
Who was that relies on

704
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,456
Efficient energy efficient semi.

705
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
What's devices

706
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,272
I'm weak right in the building box for that

707
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,600
So you only view what we doing now is really at the house

708
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,672
Hope everything Master is trying to achieve cuz he's all that data

709
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,952
Capturing it moving it

710
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,024
Using it process again getting the inside from it

711
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,840
In that kind of vein of data

712
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
Machine learning

713
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,424
Specifically

714
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,776
I'm super excited about this cuz it's been awhile since there's been a lot of chips

715
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
He's running around

716
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,104
There are several of those is that something you guys might look

717
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
Acquisition

718
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,712
Is snow something out have a rule out there a little C

719
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,016
Chip companies are getting building

720
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
Pictures

721
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
Pakistan

722
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,416
We're Young once we have activities

723
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,720
Ian Axel starting point is more th

724
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,304
Machine learning algorithms applied in

725
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,120
It's devices in this microphone

726
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,936
In it devices

727
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,496
Lots and lots of a processing he's going to start

728
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
And we see that was a huge

729
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,592
Where dementia security

730
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,872
And specifically

731
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,152
Everybody's big panic

732
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,688
Spectre & meltdown

733
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,248
Initially arm-based processors

734
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
We're not

735
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,832
But now it turns out they are

736
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,880
So can you talk to us about what you guys are

737
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:41,792
So when the this particular type of responsibility cup discovered a bunch of research is over Google

738
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,120
They contacted us then I contacted Intel and AMD

739
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Because

740
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,168
Any processor

741
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,984
That uses advanced phone to speculations

742
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,520
High performance

743
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,544
He's potentially

744
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,872
In this way what we did was going to analyze our products

745
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,408
Because she is typos

746
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,176
Attack

747
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
Is brand new

748
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,968
And it really is

749
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,760
Very sophisticated very calm

750
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,856
Flex and utilizes features which nobody could ever

751
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
Utica security

752
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,720
So we spent on analyzing that was ever a time when

753
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:15,072
Affected over there they all because it when this news broke

754
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,352
Yeah we were very much out

755
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,888
Public very rapidly

756
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,264
With ears are analysis and situations of the Saints of all communication with our partners about

757
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,664
Which products are affected with y'all and we've been probably taken out streaming issues and fixes that are required and working Pro

758
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,528
You guys are in a little bit of the unique spot because

759
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
Licensing a

760
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,856
The check to somebody else who sells

761
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,136
In products

762
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
How do you insurance

763
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,000
Asbury Broadway

764
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
How do you ensure that

765
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
What year did

766
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
To solve the

767
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
You're it

768
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,120
All the way up

769
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:55,520
It controls you say we're in a supply chain away quite a long way down it but

770
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,800
Web developer roles

771
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,592
The architectures developer

772
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Princesses

773
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
Using

774
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,688
We spent a lot of time thinking about the subway that's going to run on

775
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,504
Even if we don't end up shipping

776
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,552
So we do a little work in open source

777
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,344
Kali Linux kernel

778
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:14,208
I'm subbing this issue particularly we spend time making sure they will pass useful Linux

779
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,000
Are we would sleep on his online

780
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,536
We make sure that was available week

781
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,864
EOS fenders

782
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,192
To understand how these Thunder abilities do pertain to

783
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Kohl's in

784
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,824
So you really refuse all relationships up and down the street to

785
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,664
Try and get everybody doing the right thing and being ready for the day when this take their life

786
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,224
So is my phone going to run slower

787
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,016
Since

788
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:44,160
That really does remind to be seen but one thing I would advise you to do absolutely is

789
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,232
When the path gets pushed to you download it and install it

790
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,512
The only thing I say is

791
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,304
What is security issue like

792
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
Oh my soul

793
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,984
Can I get exploit III malware on your device sorry if ever there was a time to be worried about your no kind of that Dodie website

794
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,848
Accepting my email that doesn't quite look right now is the time to

795
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,128
Really really be

796
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
Aware of that

797
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
The boss in the first place

798
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:10,272
So yeah I do the software patches and continue to practice Can I have

799
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,064
Safe cyber security

800
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,392
Good hygiene okay

801
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
Spectrum

802
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
Actually

803
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:23,328
Was it just like it was

804
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
Thought about

805
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,240
How do we try to

806
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
About security

807
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
And then also implements

808
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,592
Going forward as we

809
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,896
More and more really important stuff

810
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
Yeah they wanted

811
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Really important

812
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
Concept

813
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,064
Head around is the insecurity isn't

814
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,088
Are you saying

815
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
That you saw

816
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,976
They have social security forever because people will find you why he's all second

817
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Writing systems

818
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,024
Spectre meltdown

819
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,328
I said I all abusing

820
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,656
Take me to the pin used in micro processes for decades

821
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,704
And what everybody considered

822
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
Asakusa

823
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Hawaii

824
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,312
You do speculation

825
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,360
If it turns out you should have done it saying

826
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,896
No 6 States

827
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
In the process of

828
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,736
What turns out they're awesome side effects

829
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
Texan eye side effects

830
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
Explosive

831
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:20,928
What's it all for 27 years. A lot of people with a lot of experience in my compressor is on everywhere and I was looked at this has just been

832
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
This technique

833
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,256
To get exploited

834
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,048
There are going to be more things like that

835
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,840
Insecurities an ever-moving

836
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:32,192
And as we move toward us billions of connected devices

837
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:32,960
Benny

838
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,752
Gazillions of art things

839
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,032
New ways to attack

840
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,568
That will come about

841
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,872
So we have to consider that security

842
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,408
Lewes Ferry on the lookout

843
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,432
Elsa shoes

844
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,224
We going to have ways to fix issue

845
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
The come up

846
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,528
Redis Spectre meltdown

847
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,320
Fixing to haul away

848
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,392
Many many Display Devices yet ready is announced

849
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:57,280
Fortunately you don't need to because the software mitigations do work and I all the right way of approaching other selling a tissue

850
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,816
In a world of iot

851
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,632
Are many things you can buy to die OTC things

852
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,168
Connected devices for your house

853
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,704
Don't have any way to have to suffer

854
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,288
It is good. Most Computing devices that are

855
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
Spectrum

856
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,128
Call Ricky end of an operating system

857
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
I see devices logged in many devices

858
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,760
I have a run is in it when it leaves the factory

859
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,064
New software

860
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,112
That might be okay but I think

861
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,160
Actually the word loyalty is going.

862
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,208
That's those devices can be managed

863
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,256
And of the software can change of the lights

864
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
The securities

865
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,096
Depressing

866
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,912
Depend on something a little bit more cheerful

867
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,472
Let's talk about we are here at CES

868
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,544
I know you haven't traveled the show floor possibly as much but

869
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,080
What are you looking for what

870
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,640
The most excited about your head for technology

871
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,920
Every year

872
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,736
Is just extra

873
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,576
Check on the Rapture of how old is technology is used in put into

874
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
Cole consumer products

875
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,928
And we spend our lives going to be in the transistors thinking about

876
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,464
Chinese down the road

877
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,512
How much compute performance you can be needed in

878
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,536
Seems generally

879
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,096
When I come to see yes I see how people actually use them

880
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
I put them in

881
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,656
Ayala glossies or

882
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:11,008
Drones for the weather this week that the demo of a

883
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,312
What time is TC to drive out there

884
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,408
Zerorez technology

885
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Presets UC

886
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,968
Jesse's mom's every year

887
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,040
And every year she was like a race of his own son is fosta

888
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:28,160
And that's because the cost of accessing the technology goes down and down and down and mow people can experiment with it

889
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,208
And you just get more Innovations results

890
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,280
Awesome thank you Simon

891
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,120
That's it for this week thanks so much for listening

892
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,424
