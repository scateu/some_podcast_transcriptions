00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,984
Hey everyone Welcome to the

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,336
Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and your co-host

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,360
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:19,968
And we are here today with lots of little bits of news so we're going to try to zip on through

5
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,248
This should be live

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,016
Pacn

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
Full of

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,344
So to kick ass off

9
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,624
Let's start with

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
The

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,952
I'm going to go with mind-boggling news

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,488
Gartner's news

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,792
They said that there are now six

14
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,608
Now we are going to be 6.4

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,376
Billion

16
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,656
With a B connected

17
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,680
Things

18
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,240
Things in use

19
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,032
In 2016

20
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,592
Up 30% from 2015

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,896
I've actually kind of amazing

22
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,200
I should have done the math before the show

23
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,736
I'm the third what

24
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,784
Is that 4 billion ish

25
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,856
Devices that are kind of currently connected

26
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,160
That's about right

27
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
That's about right

28
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,840
3.8 I'm sorry I'm looking at their number installs by category millions of units

29
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,144
2014 3.8 billion

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
2015 nurse biking 4.9 and then in 2016 6.392 or Isaac

31
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,848
6.4 billion

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,712
And so most of these devices

33
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
In their category breakdown

34
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,808
Are actually consumer devices

35
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,648
Which I thought was kind of pretty crazy because

36
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,440
A lot of people

37
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,840
When you say internet of things I know we talked about the consumer a lot but most people are like oh it's all this crazy connected Factory

38
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
But no

39
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,936
Know the vast majority of their devices

40
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
This year it's like

41
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,520
3 billion

42
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
Other 4.9 billion

43
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,592
AR

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
Connected consumer

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Devices

46
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,992
And even going out to 20/20 when they expect

47
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
20 point

48
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,576
8 billion devices to be connected

49
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
13 point

50
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,184
6 billion of them are going to be consumer

51
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232
Set alarm alarm

52
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:11,840
Skewed percentage any surprise me too and that's why I added to the show notes because

53
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:17,216
You're right and we think of there's all these vertical markets and the industrial sector

54
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,544
You know smart meters and all these other things but

55
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
Really it looks like

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
The consumer Market is

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Driving

58
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,176
Well that's in terms of number of things

59
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
But then we get into

60
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Dollars

61
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,296
Here's where it gets a little bit more fun

62
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
Consumer applications will about 2

63
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
546 billion dollars in

64
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
2016 so that's next year

65
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,632
What's the use of connected things in the Enterprise will drive 868 billion dollars

66
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
In that same.

67
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
So

68
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
Consumers

69
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
We've got

70
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,776
More stuff and connected objects

71
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
But the Enterprise stuff

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
Makes our cost more money

73
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
Which you're getting ripped off

74
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Yeah basically

75
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:04,832
We're all doing DIY and they're all like healthy Consultants ready for Enterprise logo on there

76
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
Struggle the price

77
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,184
So that's the Gartner study it was out on Tuesday

78
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
Band

79
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
Totally worth looking into because

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,424
Because a it's a lot of things but it feels a little bit more realistic than some of the earlier studies that we had in Tallahassee

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
Study that had I believe

82
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,776
50 billion devices in 2020

83
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:27,616
This is a little bit more realistic at 20.8 billion

84
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,200
But you know it all fairness some of these numbers were like just tossed out like

85
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
Probably

86
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,784
I think it was like 3 years ago

87
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,648
3 years ago this was pretty new and we were all like

88
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,488
Do you know A lot's changed since then

89
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,536
We got a little bit more practical

90
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
And you know

91
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:54,240
Forecasting stuff is never easy but you're right a few years back or talk about such huge numbers right not going to happen but

92
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,568
Reality is there sharing 2014 and 20th

93
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,616
Pmdd data actual data

94
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
It is prime

95
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,224
As Beijing as fast as they said it would have several years ago so

96
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,368
Besides you think might be a big thing Sunday

97
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
Really I am

98
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Stacy's cat

99
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,351
There's a subcategory for hubs and right now you've got the market share so

100
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
So next item up

101
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,215
In terms of spending on connected things

102
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,311
You can buy the Amazon Echo in retail stores

103
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
For the Christmas season

104
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
For the holidays

105
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
This is I think very good news at

106
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
So kind of surprising since

107
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,623
8U Amazon obviously sells Kindle devices and other things in retail stores but they're also known as the

108
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,903
Shopping Hub of

109
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,927
The online world

110
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,231
And The Echoes of very unique device

111
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,815
Keep it to themselves to some point but

112
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
But now there's a whole list

113
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,679
You never talk about them right before the show

114
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,287
Who is the who's going to sell this RadioShack which surprised me to be on the list at all

115
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
Staples switch

116
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,871
Now that makes sense that got the whole connected home

117
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
Get up so talk about right then

118
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,319
Brookstone wearable cost twice as much of the riverhouse navigating

119
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
Home Depot

120
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
Westworld PC Richards at Fry's

121
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Hhgregg

122
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
Sears where you don't pick up your vacuum

123
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
Clear bags if your me

124
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
Lincoln shutting down by May 6th

125
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:29,727
Hard to find a Sears but yes they will be in serious as well BJ's Wholesale Club so maybe get a discount there

126
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
It's not because

127
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,103
Notable know your place I didn't see it two of them

128
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Target

129
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
And Best Buy

130
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,455
Which is kind of a shame

131
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
For the holiday season because

132
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,807
But I don't know I mean I don't go into

133
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
Site for the holidays

134
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,719
Too much every day of the holiday season for me so I'm in Best Buy a lot

135
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,071
But I was actually kind of surprised because Best Buy is actually really

136
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,095
Trying to create life

137
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,703
Service business around the connected home and they sell a lot of other connected

138
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Tom products

139
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
And the echo is

140
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
Actually really good beginner product

141
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
Believe it or not

142
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
And Target

143
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
Because they're really

144
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,991
Doing some really cool stuff around the connected home

145
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,783
And once again

146
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Day

147
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:21,439
Are really emphasizing how these things all work together and the echo is really done a lot to

148
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Kind of

149
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,559
Trace consumer awareness I think

150
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,631
Both of those stores probably feel a lot of tension

151
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
With Amazon

152
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,495
Although they I believe both of those stores also sell

153
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Candles

154
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,591
I think they do I know what kind of Target

155
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:44,991
Does Imagine Best Buy doesn't actually I just bought something at Best Buy this weekend they will

156
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,343
Match Amazon prices so I got new a discount on that so you're right there's tension there there

157
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,391
They're definitely in combating

158
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
Amazon there so

159
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
I don't know

160
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,815
I mean cuz the echo is not just a smart home automation Hub it's also a

161
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
Hey

162
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
Person who lives in the Echo

163
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
Will you pick up

164
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
Will you order this from

165
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,775
So we cannot live

166
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
It's a pretty good product

167
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,663
Even without the smart home integration stuff and we talked about for the smarthome bits

168
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
Touchpoints book

169
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,783
You know Isaac connecting Bluetooth speaker a personal assistant software

170
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
It's pretty interesting

171
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
Okay so

172
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
Next item

173
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
Let's see

174
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
We've got hope

175
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
Do you want to talk about a smartwatch

176
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
What is the greatest

177
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
Not this one but I will

178
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
So

179
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
I remember it was in May or March

180
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,727
Intel said they're going to be working with tag hair

181
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
2

182
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Create an

183
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
Android Wear smartwatch

184
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,383
And at the time I could have sworn I said

185
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
It would be powered by their clock chip

186
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,551
Set sound right it says sound right in their courtship is now the chip that's on there

187
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
Siri platform

188
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,207
For those and the tree platform is Intel's wearable platform

189
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
It competes with

190
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
It was supposed to compete with

191
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
All of the arm low power

192
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
So so

193
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
So background good now present day

194
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
Earlier this week

195
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
The watch was introduced

196
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,335
It's called the tag

197
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,127
Are connected

198
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
What Carrera connected watch

199
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,991
It will cost you $1,500

200
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:26,879
It does not have a QuikTrip in it it has from what we can tell an Intel atom dual-core chip that's

201
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
Clock IT 1.6 gigahertz but then

202
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,279
Ramps down to 500 megahertz because I don't want the battery to

203
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
Run out in 3 hours

204
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:40,703
Here's the interesting crazy bit and there are lots of Android Wear watches not working today that start as low as $150

205
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,751
So if you would like to buy

206
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
K-Swiss

207
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
Made or Swiss made brand

208
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
Android Wear watch you can do so now

209
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,735
I'm kind of scratching my head over so because really you buy Swiss made watch I have several of them

210
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Mundane

211
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,807
Tissot Omega

212
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
Hamilton songs

213
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:01,951
You buy those for the mechanical bits inside that are Swiss made

214
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
But there aren't any mechanical bits in your

215
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,327
Strictly brand you're getting a digital watch face

216
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,119
Made my tag hair

217
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
And

218
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,263
1500 boxes to part with for Android Wear smartwatch

219
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Here's a really great party

220
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,127
Paper to your back-up plan because I don't think they think it's going to be successful

221
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,967
At the end of two years when they think the watch will be outdated

222
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,015
You would then treat your the option

223
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
I should say to trade it in

224
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,415
And pay another $1,500 and get a real tag hair

225
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Carrera watch

226
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
One that doesn't have a chip in it

227
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
That's correct.

228
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,119
Traditional true Swiss made analog mechanical watch

229
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,935
You're going to pay $3,000 in the end if you go that route

230
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
And you have to give back an Android

231
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
Watch which probably will be outdated

232
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,079
Wait so how much is like a real Tag Heuer watch

233
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,151
Easily 3000 you can spend for 5

234
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
Oh okay so like

235
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,015
So basically I'm getting a smartwatch

236
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:03,391
You're going to rent a townhouse

237
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
Yeah pretty much

238
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
Pretty much

239
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,767
Okay it's just really the most it just reeks of

240
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,559
We don't think this is really going to work

241
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,423
And we don't think you are going to buy this for 1500 so we're going to do is we're going to add some incentive

242
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
And say

243
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,239
You're halfway paid towards a real watch

244
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,151
It is interesting and it's cheaper than a Porsche Carrera which is all that

245
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Well yes

246
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
Much much cheaper than that

247
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:32,319
When I first heard about the $1,500 so I can know where they're going to sell any of these quite honestly

248
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,159
I don't think Apple sells a lot of their $10,000 and up Apple watches for example

249
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
But you know what there is that incentive that

250
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,791
Yeah it's kind of like a downpayment on a

251
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
Traditional watch

252
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
2 years from now

253
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,631
Okay well that's

254
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,703
See and I was looking at this strictly from the standpoint of

255
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,263
Has Intel Curie platform

256
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
You managed to become

257
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
Like competitive with arm

258
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
In the answer appears to be no

259
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
And

260
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,967
Also apparently if you are a watch band

261
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
This may not be the deal for you

262
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:08,415
Well I'm in the only a 1,500 saved up for your new tag hair and maybe it is

263
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
Will know it sounds like you should probably have

264
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
F3000

265
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
Cuz if you paid 1500

266
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,119
Then you spent $750 for

267
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
IWatch for a year

268
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:24,031
Unless you can stretch it to 3 I'm really good at stretching things out like that the life of my life

269
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,103
Smart watches I don't think

270
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,895
3 years is going to cut it

271
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
I just don't

272
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
So fancy smart watches

273
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
It's not our thing

274
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,527
How how long are you going to keep your Apple watch

275
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:40,415
You know that's a good question I don't know when they might refresh I don't know if I can do a yearly refresh

276
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
I have to see

277
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
What they added

278
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,839
You know what I assume they'll put a GPS radio in there next time around which I would really like

279
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
But other than that

280
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,191
I'm fine with what it does and

281
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
What I have today

282
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
How much was

283
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
I bought the cheapest one you can get for 350 bucks

284
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,127
The average sales price

285
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,199
Tends to be between four and five hundred dollars are not selling

286
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,271
A lot of those precious metal watches they're selling a lot of B

287
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Entry

288
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,367
Model the sport edition actually about two-thirds of the estimate

289
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,183
Two-thirds of the total Apple watch sales are in the

290
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
350 $400 ring

291
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,839
Alright next news item

292
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
Let's see

293
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
Oh

294
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
Speaking of wearables

295
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,263
Let's talk about arm because

296
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,615
Well because you already have your arm

297
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
So much for

298
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
So much worse

299
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Officer

300
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
Okay

301
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
Arm is coming back

302
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
It has a new

303
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,207
Processor design so things to know

304
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Background

305
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:51,071
Is arm doesn't make chips it is a chip design

306
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
That makes

307
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Designs

308
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:57,727
And then Jacob Riis license arms designed and then they build their own chips

309
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,567
And they can either build straight from arms designs or they can tweak the design

310
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
State Farm Gibson

311
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
To a certain extent

312
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
And then

313
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
Annabelle demon pants

314
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,503
Send customers Qualcomm Apple

315
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
Even Intel actually has an armless

316
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Believe it or not

317
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,415
The newest arm architecture design was announced today at

318
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
It's user conference

319
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
And

320
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
It has

321
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:25,887
Two things worth noted one is the A35 which The Internet of Things show doesn't care much about but it's for

322
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
Basically blower power

323
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Smartphone

324
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
Consider going to be cheaper

325
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
But

326
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
This shows purpose

327
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
This is what we really care about is the

328
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
Really terribly named

329
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
V

330
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
8

331
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
M

332
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,735
Architecture design

333
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,783
Which don't even think about that because

334
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Hideously name

335
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,647
I'm basically what it is is arm is taking its trustzone

336
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
Security features

337
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
From smartphones and server chips

338
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,047
Kind of chips for smartphones and servers

339
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,095
And bring it down to the microcontroller

340
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
Where's that's what I am stands for

341
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
And

342
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,823
This is awesome because that means the Internet of Things is finally going to get some unified security

343
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
Teachers at the chip level

344
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,175
Which me and it's going to be at like

345
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
The design

346
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
Double the arm design level

347
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,783
And this is important because right now

348
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,111
A lot of the security we see at the chip level is coming from like

349
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,647
The chip vendors themselves

350
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:26,047
And they're like all their MCS have different layer like different ways of implementing security so if your developer in

351
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,887
Building on the Capri scale MCU you got one way to do security

352
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,727
Lmcu you got a different way of doing security

353
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
So

354
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
What's Happening Here is

355
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
Actually a unification

356
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,871
One step below that

357
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Witches

358
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Awesome

359
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Now that's

360
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,039
That's good news for these devices and we talked about security and

361
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,111
Smart Homes and iot a the past and it's been a

362
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
And eyebrow razor like

363
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:56,767
How is all this going to be secured and there's a lot of other aspects of that your data in the cloud so on but

364
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
But at the device level

365
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,095
All the way down to the third ship level

366
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,703
This is cake that's pretty exciting and then we also have in the esoteric kind of like

367
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
Hardware standards world we also have

368
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,079
Threat certification which is out this week

369
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
And

370
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
I don't know this

371
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,223
I'm excited about how do you feel about thread surf

372
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
I can it's important it's important I just

373
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
I haven't seen much

374
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Tangible

375
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,207
Products Medical Products using thread yet

376
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
Finessed

377
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,791
Okay so here's what thread is

378
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,351
If you guys for those of you who don't remember

379
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,887
And that's okay if you don't because

380
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
Kevin's right

381
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
It's not out by then the market because

382
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,799
Basically just been invented this is a wireless protocol so

383
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,847
It's like zigbee or Wi-Fi or

384
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,687
Bluetooth so it's a it's a way for devices to talk to each other

385
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,735
It's a mesh Network it is

386
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,039
Low data rate so tiny little bit today.

387
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
Is close range

388
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
And

389
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
It speaks IPv6

390
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,415
And it goes straight to the cloud

391
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,719
So it can talk to her but

392
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
It's it can also go straight to the cloud

393
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
And those are kind of the big salient

394
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
Do I have to say it was a mesh Network

395
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
I think it is

396
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Okay great

397
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,751
So it's going to compete or coexist depending on how you know

398
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
How you want to feel about it

399
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,359
With kind of existing Wireless protocols

400
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:21,247
The big companies that invented it and kind of gathering around it are free scale Samsung

401
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Nest

402
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
Silicon labs

403
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Osram

404
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,927
Salary

405
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
Appliance

406
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,791
So I actually got off the phone today with Procter & Gamble

407
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
The Giant

408
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,399
Consumer goods company and they're actually trying to innovate around

409
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Arthritis swelling

410
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,775
I talked to someone there he was like yeah we really believe that this is actually going to be

411
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,615
What Society moves towards for the connected home

412
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
For Consumer products

413
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
Interesting

414
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,735
It was on my Proctor again

415
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,783
So that a company I would have expected

416
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,319
Yasso

417
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
A

418
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,159
Guys Procter & Gamble's excited about the internet of things and be

419
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
Vocalizing around thread

420
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
Hey

421
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
Pretty cool so

422
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
Red certification

423
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
It's out their current products using it

424
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,351
Nest later products

425
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
We'll see

426
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
All right

427
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
Until finally

428
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
Kind of talks so much on the show Kevin

429
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
That's okay I'm listening

430
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,127
If I could just hug you for that

431
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
So

432
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
Big is

433
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,759
I have been testing for the last like 2 days cuz

434
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
This isn't like an in-depth test

435
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,623
It's not really end up the product but it's pretty cool the roost

436
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:36,255
Smart home I don't even know what to call it it's a it's a battery it's connected battery for smoke detector

437
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,351
I don't know if you remember me talking about this Kevin but

438
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,447
I don't I don't in an action curious because you know we do the whole

439
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
Swap out the batteries

440
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
When we change the clocks

441
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
We didn't do that

442
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,847
Smoke detectors this year so what is this do

443
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,383
This is going to be great for you

444
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
I don't know okay so

445
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
Roost is a Smart 9 volt

446
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Battery

447
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,831
Design to go in your smoke.

448
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,159
So this is a wifi-connected battery

449
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,719
You pop it into your smoke detector

450
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,559
And you download the app and suddenly you can see

451
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
When your smoke detector is on

452
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,167
Right and you can also see when it goes off

453
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:19,263
You'll get a notification on your phone it would also tell like a circle of your friends

454
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,871
Spike your neighbors are whoever you want to notify for alerts of things

455
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,943
And then you can also it'll also tell you like

456
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
Hey your battery is about to

457
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:36,415
Obviously I've only had it in for 2 days so I can't tell you how long the battery last but that is when

458
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
Weather today

459
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,559
This is interesting this seems like a way to retrofit and turn old

460
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,607
Smart smoke detectors into

461
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,703
Smart one spaceship through the battery I like this okay

462
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
And so it's a little bit expensive

463
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,591
It's 3499 for One battery

464
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,919
It's 65 for 2Pac

465
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
A batteries

466
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
But

467
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
That's cheaper than a nest

468
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
Protect which is the current

469
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,135
Right now your options in the connected

470
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
The smoke

471
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Are like

472
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Replacing

473
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,047
Your existing smoke detector with like a kitty

474
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,351
Is that a kid I don't know how to say these

475
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,959
Sing. Leah k i d d e n

476
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,799
They have a proprietary radio so you have to work with like one of their hubs

477
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,079
If

478
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,103
So that's not

479
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
Great for anyone who doesn't want to mess with

480
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,223
And no smoke detectors are

481
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Fletc

482
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
Look at how much a Kidde smoke detector is

483
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
I think they're about

484
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Actually

485
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
You can get something like that

486
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,975
And yeah

487
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:47,327
So some of the some of the connected ones that talked to the hubs are a little bit more

488
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
That's if they're only $25

489
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
So

490
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,471
And you can get versions that are little fancier with different

491
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
Lights

492
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
So

493
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,615
This is kind of within that price range but you basically just

494
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
Plop out of battery

495
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
And

496
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
You're golden in this way

497
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
It connects to your phone you got the app

498
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,599
The other option you have is something like Leo

499
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,183
Which is like $100 night light that listens for your smoke

500
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:17,023
Alarm to go off and then can they give you the notification function

501
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,071
But that can't tell you

502
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:24,703
When your existing smoke alarms about to run out of battery so you still can have that issue

503
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,031
I like chirping at 3 a.m. and not knowing sure

504
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,383
We have to chase the trip in our house addresses nuts

505
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,687
So this this eliminates that

506
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:42,623
You don't at first I thought $35 for a battery no but now that now that it could basically term

507
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,927
Dumb smoke content with Smart Ones

508
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,767
And as if I'm reading this right the battery last for up to five years

509
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,583
Yes oh yes it does last for a long time

510
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,655
And the nice thing is you don't have to take it out

511
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,727
You know every year like you do your other one

512
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
You're going to know my name

513
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:05,151
Yeah now it doesn't look like it you mention there's an IOS and Android app that this works with now

514
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,503
It doesn't look like it works with any smart home hubs but they do say that they are

515
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,367
Opening up an API for it so I presume we'll see some decoration points

516
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,952
So I am so this is one of those things where I am okay

517
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,512
With my smoke alarm not working with a hub

518
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
Mostly because

519
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,608
It has audio sounds as it is

520
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,168
Yeah and I'm I'm less worried I mean

521
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,240
Guess they're cool automations were like my Hue Lights can

522
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
Lexi

523
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,336
Get off my smoke alarm goes off my Hue Lights will

524
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,616
In a Flash reading

525
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:40,480
I can flick see through the smoke and I think that's me Nest protect has that kind of integration

526
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,760
Euphoric symbol

527
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,808
But I'm actually okay with

528
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:49,440
You don't want it if this then that channels that we can turn on you no water

529
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,000
My rachio sprinklers

530
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,560
I'm okay without that too

531
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,120
IIA don't have the sprinklers in

532
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
NB

533
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,728
It doesn't bother me if it's not if it doesn't have any other Integrations is just

534
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,056
It's a personal preference and end up speaking only for myself

535
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,104
I like to have everything in one app

536
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,176
Nice as it is I have a folder of apps and

537
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
Annoys the crap outta me that I've

538
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,784
I want to do this

539
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
Just a person

540
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,392
Yeah but for me this is not a nap I'm ever going to

541
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
This is truly just going to be something

542
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,720
Yells at me

543
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,816
Install on 5 years from now you on here

544
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Front wheel

545
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
That's that's the plan

546
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,936
And so I got eight smoke detectors in my house

547
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,728
So I'm looking at

548
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:38,592
$260 to upgrade my entire house to smart

549
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,176
As opposed to eight Nest protect

550
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
800

551
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:49,344
$200 for two Leos but then I I'm still doing chirping and since

552
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,880
Play 3 night

553
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
Three weeks ago I was chasing a chirp

554
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,232
It's still fresh in my mind some kind of like

555
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,792
60 bucks more not to chase the chirp

556
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
It's worth it

557
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,168
It's going on my holiday listening

558
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704

559
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,264
Yep so all right all the kids will get one

560
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
Oh thanks for the

Stay tuned because I have a guest for you

569
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,512

570
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
No my

571
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,840
Our former colleague Chris Albrecht

572
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
He and I were at

573
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,936
It is that last week on the smart kitchen

574
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
So he and I are talking about

575
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
The smart kitchen surprise

576
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:44,128
That was run by a former colleague of ours as well it was like

577
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,408
Return to giga

578
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,760
Sarita talked about robotic team Acres

579
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
And

580
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,856
More on the Echo and we got a little

581
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
Earl Grey hot

582
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,280
If I ever have a robotic tea maker I'm going to program it

583
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
With your voice

584
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,608
So every morning I can wake up

585
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Can have

586
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:13,056
Now you're scaring me

587
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
There you go

588
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,784
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

589
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,880
And we are here with your guests today who is Chris Albrecht

590
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:30,976
He was an MC at an event I was at last week called the smart

591
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
Kitchen Summit

592
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
Hey Chris

593
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,304
Hey Stacy

594
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:39,680
So it's important for you guys to know that Chris is a former colleague of Kevin's in mine from gigaohm

595
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,496
And currently he's at a startup called one hub

596
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:46,080
But the most relevant fact you need to know about Chris

597
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,384
We were both at this event

598
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,944
And the next most relevant facts you need to know about

599
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,968
Chris is this

600
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
Chris

601
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,016
Do you want a spark kitchen

602
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,088
I got to tell you right now I'm not really seeing it

603
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
All right

604
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
OKC

605
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,000
Kind of reinforced a little bit by this might get to Summit having said that

606
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,304
I want to make sure it's understood that I thought it was a great

607
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,376
Conference our former colleague Mike Wolfe put it on

608
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,192
He asked me to MC it and even though I'm not

609
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,776
Super interested in this market December they were a lot of great speakers that day

610
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
With a lot of interesting

611
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Content

612
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,408
Yes sir this was like an all-day event with people from

613
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:26,784
Like the start of World that we've had on the show like the June oven people that drop kitchen scale

614
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,344
Tons of connected devices for the kitchen

615
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,392
Even some folks from Amazon

616
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:36,256
And then a bunch of people from like the Appliance in Old School world like that

617
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,816
The president of Williams-Sonoma was there

618
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,216
Guy from Electrolux and Jardin those the people to make the connected crock pot which is not refrigerated

619
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:51,872
I did not I was so crestfallen when I saw that I got so excited for you cuz I know for years you've been talking about the refrigerated connected

620
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,968
Crock-Pot there is a device you guys on Kickstarter called mellow

621
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,064
That is kind of like a Crock-Pot it is also refrigerated

622
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,600
But I feel like

623
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,880
It's probably not

624
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,416
Actually come to fruition

625
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
But

626
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,000
You know we'll talk more about that on another show not the show

627
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,024
I'll try to get the

628
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
People on to see if this

629
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
It's going to be a real thing

630
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
So

631
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,680
Back to the smart kitchen so that's what this event was it was really great

632
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Lot of good content

633
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
First off

634
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,544
Smart kitchens we kind of talked about

635
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
What that means for

636
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,384
Increase you don't want a smart kitchen

637
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,688
What do you even think of when you hear the phrase smart

638
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,856
So I think it's also important to kind of set the scene a little bit my wife predominantly does the cooking just cuz she loved

639
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Loves to cook

640
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,416
And she's a much better cook than I

641
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,024
And so when I tell her like oh there's is neat I love gadgets though so I'm all about

642
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,840
Oh what can we connect our up and what can we do

643
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,656
What's the neat little doohickey that I can look

644
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,192
I use my phone with

645
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,288
I want to bring that up and she just kind of looks at me and gives me the the cartoon blank blank

646
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,616
Like why would that to see why would you want that

647
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,664
So it there's sort of a

648
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
Because I know I'm not the predominant

649
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,272
Person in the kitchen for good reason

650
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,576
We pretended not we

651
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,368
We're not really a smart kitchen house

652
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,672
And but I

653
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
I love

654
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:14,560
Kind of the gadgets that are coming out they all just seem so expensive right now and I feel like I'm kind of rambling and I'm sorry

655
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
That's okay

656
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
Alright so

657
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
I think one of us

658
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,960
What I think of a smart kitchen I actually don't think of what

659
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
I don't think I know what you're saying

660
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,336
I don't think about a bunch of gadgets I actually think about

661
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,152
A kitchen that

662
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,480
Can actually help me because when I am cooking

663
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,016
I am actually performing

664
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,320
A bunch of really highly choreographed

665
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,600
Steps Ray time

666
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,672
Chopping a bunch of stuff I usually have fire going on somewhere

667
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
Usually

668
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
I am

669
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,304
You know trying to do like way too many things at once cuz I never like

670
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
Prepare everything all at once right that's

671
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
That's like just did

672
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
Pipedream for me

673
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
So

674
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,496
I'm running around and tossing things into the pot

675
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,520
Washington

676
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
And

677
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,640
I don't have time to pick up my smartphone because my hands are dirty and because

678
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
I got some things on fire

679
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,504
So for me that idea is I really want something

680
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,320
That integrates into my workflow and doesn't

681
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
Take me out of it

682
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,136
So I want

683
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
Things like the Amazon Alexa

684
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,256
Okay sorry the Amazon Echo

685
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280
Where I can be like

686
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
Hey

687
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
Lady in the Echo

688
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,144
Set a timer for this amount

689
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,216
It happens without me pressing anything or going some

690
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Place

691
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,080
I doubt she actually be Echo with some of the people talked about a lot during that day

692
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,432
So and actually it wasn't a device that

693
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,344
I am intrigued by and I went back and actually read your big article on it when I think it came out in June

694
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,928
Without that piece it came out for the General Public

695
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
Somewhere around Mayer

696
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,256
Right and so

697
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,048
The idea of to your point like

698
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
Not coming up

699
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
IPhone or an iPad

700
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,400
But the ability to connect

701
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,448
What I want to explore is the ability to connect

702
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
The echo

703
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
So

704
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
You can

705
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,312
What I want or need to find out probably

706
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,128
From you or other people I just how well the voice commands work

707
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
And how many steps you can throw in cuz I think actually

708
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,760
The echo was a really good idea for

709
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,552
Creating what you are talking about

710
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
I think

711
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,648
At this event and I don't think we really

712
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,208
Got into it as much as I would have liked

713
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,792
We have AAFES Silicon Valley types who are like

714
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:25,632
I have reinvented the oven for you I've reinvented a robot that makes tea

715
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
And

716
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,752
We didn't really talk about how this is going to hit mainstream

717
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
America

718
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,336
And how we're going to get this into her kitchen

719
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
Today

720
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,176
Right well and I think one of the things

721
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,712
I mean part and parcel with

722
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
That right is

723
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:44,576
Silicon Valley startup people are used to kind of this planned obsolescence

724
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:48,672
Upgrading your phone every two years upgrading your TV every 5 years

725
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
Write like

726
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,000
And when you get something big like an appliance

727
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
Like an oven

728
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
Which

729
00:29:54,816 --> 00:30:00,960
You know comes with a house typically or has a space for it you know has a big empty place with wiring all set for

730
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,824
What I see when I see those interfaces under cycle what's going to happen when they upgrade

731
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
What am I going to miss out on

732
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,432
In two years from now when they're software does X

733
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
And they haven't

734
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
You know they don't

735
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,272
They don't support

736
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296
Versions behind

737
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
You know what I mean

738
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,416
When when they add like a high-definition to my

739
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
My Smart Oven

740
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
I'm stuck on this

741
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
Standard definition

742
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,560
Are 4K you know what I'm stuck on HD

743
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
You can look at garbage

744
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,680
I need I need so many pixels for my turkey

745
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,520
So that's to that kind of like here's why I like

746
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,056
And where Amazon is going

747
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,616
Because between the echo

748
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
But also just their dash button

749
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,992
I think are so that I think that you could talk away into things

750
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,040
And as they expand

751
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,856
What they could be good for or maybe make them programmable

752
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:54,464
So and I apologize if this has been written about but if they had like a barcode reader

753
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
I think just a blank one

754
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,536
And you had a barcode reader

755
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,584
Since I was like oh this one is for

756
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,912
Pasta or this one's for this particular kind of bread

757
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
And when I get low I get the button

758
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,264
That to me is really interesting

759
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,312
Let's put a line of demarcation here

760
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,360
Cuz we've moved from talking about kind of Lake

761
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,408
Gadgets and food prep

762
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,944
And now we're talking about like

763
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,224
Food acquisition

764
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:21,088
Or I think we're also just talking about unifying the kitchen at a workspace right like making extremely

765
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,904
Okay so like to your point I think

766
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,720
Granite we are talking kind of or approaching it differently

767
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:30,304
You know where is you are looking at a for a director to kind of

768
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,632
If coordinate the symphony when you are creating your masterpiece

769
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:38,496
I'm looking for something that seamlessly fits in that I that I don't feel will be

770
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,336
Obsolete especially now when we're getting like these are all first-generation product

771
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,896
So I I think on the dash side

772
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
I think

773
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
Yes

774
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,248
You are you are so

775
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,320
That I think that is a really great

776
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
Solution

777
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,672
Both from a retrofit standpoint like

778
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,208
Awesome because

779
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,352
You know you paid for 99 you get this button and you get 499 discounted whatever it is that button orders

780
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,912
Amazon is expanding the program

781
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:11,008
There was a guy from Amazon. She was at the show talking

782
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
And he was like

783
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,848
You know our retailers are excited about it

784
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,384
We're excited about it

785
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
He said that

786
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:21,248
Anchor most popular button is the Smart Water button

787
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
And

788
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,600
People interact with that every 11 days

789
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,648
I got to get there electrolytes

790
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
Exactly I'm like

791
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,000
Jennifer Aniston made them do it

792
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,048
Emirates Airline

793
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,144
But that's also something really easy that like my son could use

794
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,448
He's going to get older and more sophisticated

795
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,984
But like if

796
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,288
When it in the next couple of years he likes

797
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,824
You know he likes dried apricots

798
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,128
And if he runs out of dried apricots then week

799
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,456
You know that's not something that I'm necessarily paying attention to

800
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,016
I mean even though I do want

801
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,600
But he could it's simple enough to where he could press it and it's not going to

802
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,416
You know require getting into my accountant

803
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:05,280
Get okra filling out a card and doing all the other stuff it's just something really simple

804
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,608
That he can learn to keep track of

805
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
And that's

806
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:14,240
That's awesome and Everyone likes pressing buttons actually the Amazon guy said that he gets

807
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,544
Biggest fan mail for the dash where

808
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,568
Couples are like

809
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,640
They they will email him and they will say things like

810
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,736
My husband says I have it he waits until I get home

811
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,784
Until we can both press the button

812
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
Together

813
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
That's how much we love this

814
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,368
Well that's

815
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,512
Once that you would do that and then to that you would write the guy at Amazon

816
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,560
And say

817
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,120
I don't normally do this but I wanted to tell you about

818
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,192
Your product to help me buy more products

819
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,472
So great

820
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,520
But

821
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
So I think

822
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,336
I think there's a couple things happen

823
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:54,944
I think one is impossible to imagine that Amazon could give you a dash for air

824
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,760
I think the idea of it being programmable

825
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
Is actually kind of

826
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,392
Smart and fun and I bet Amazon will do that eventually

827
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:07,744
They also have an addition to the dash something called the Amazon

828
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,792
Dash fulfillment service

829
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,840
And that is an automatic

830
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:17,216
It's for products and they build basically sensors in that connects back to Amazon

831
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,776
So without you actually having to press the button

832
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,800
Free things like

833
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,128
A dog food dog food in a dog food canister

834
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
It will actually

835
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,968
Automatically sends when that

836
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,504
Canister is running low

837
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
And sent you more

838
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:37,184
So another way that this kind of all ties together right is that I've been on a kind of a diet for the past few months

839
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,792
And I use one of those food that's not it like a special one it's just sort of like

840
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,584
Hey hey dummy eat less

841
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:48,960
You don't need to jam wheat wheat thins in your mama all day long right but it's it it's got a food tracker in it

842
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:55,360
Pet scan the barcode and then brings up all the nutritional information about that and then I input how much is a 8th of that particular thing

843
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,176
So as part of that I was eating a lot of eggs

844
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,248
And so for it the kind of tie in with my shopping list

845
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,552
Some kind of Amazonian shopping list it will go like

846
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
Oh hey

847
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,160
I noticed that your Fitness tracker that you've been eating a lot of eggs and

848
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,440
Based on you know

849
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:15,584
We think you might be running low based on whatever maybe I bought a dozen eggs and it seemed that I've eaten six of them by Wednesday

850
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,144
Then it could automatically add that to

851
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,936
That shopping list

852
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,752
Okay so this gets into something that

853
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,312
I am super passionate about most people probably are like

854
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
Which is

855
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,944
There's so many ways to input data into kind of

856
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,016
Look at the cloud The Internet of Things whatever

857
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,320
So you could grab that data from

858
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,624
Your Fitness your your food tracker

859
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
Right

860
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,672
Your food tracker app

861
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
But that doesn't

862
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,488
Get everybody in your household

863
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,024
It's probably not the best way

864
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:49,376
You could get it through like a dedicated device like I used to have the quirky egg

865
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
Minder

866
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:55,008
Stop it like device which actually literally counted how many eggs are in my refrigerator

867
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,080
It was a dedicated device for that it was the

868
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,104
Stupid money

869
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,224
You could also get it from like a camera in your fridge that like

870
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:09,088
You know A in food recognition that then exported it to a shopping list

871
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,416
You could get it from like you telling your Amazon

872
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,440
Echo

873
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,720
Hey I need more eggs

874
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,304
You see like

875
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,352
And I think what's going to happen is

876
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:25,984
Every family is going to approach this a little bit differently because we love having Variety in choice

877
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,800
So I think the key isn't actually going to be like

878
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
Iceman dating

879
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,688
How we want to do that it's actually going to be developing standards around

880
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
How we

881
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
Call an egg an egg

882
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:38,784
So

883
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,344
When we say we want an egg

884
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:47,232
All of these things will actually be able to recognize what an egg is and they can just like

885
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,024
Pop it in the list and then it's out of it

886
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,048
Does that make sense

887
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,936
Yeah absolutely in that the reason I was bringing up the like a food tracker thing is cuz my wife will often say is like

888
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,240
What do you want me to pick up at the store

889
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
And

890
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,312
What's the device for you

891
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,872
Okay it's called the haiku

892
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,920
Okay $50

893
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
Your son might even lie

894
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,016
So what you do is a refrigerator magnet

895
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:14,112
And it has a barcode scanner and voice activation

896
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,696
And then it also has Partnerships with both Walmart and Peapod

897
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
So

898
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,792
You press a button and we had

899
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,840
The CEO Haiku was our guest

900
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,632
We can talk about food all months

901
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,168
Because hey it's almost Thanksgiving

902
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,472
Yay see press the button

903
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,264
And you say

904
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
Add eggs

905
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,568
And then it goes to both and

906
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,872
App on your phone or your wife's phone

907
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,408
For Andrew Weissman rather

908
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,016
And she can either pick it up at the store or you can create a list in

909
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:46,880
Can I pick up curbside delivery at participating Walmart's or you can have it delivered from Peapod

910
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,208
I will check it out

911
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,096
Are there are two things at that we've been talking about that to think that we have kind of danced around here

912
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:02,240
And that I want to talk with you about specifically one I want to give you a call back

913
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,776
To the stupid expensive

914
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,592
And then to talk about platform

915
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:12,224
Alright feel like those are two things that are holding me back one lets the start was stupid expensive

916
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,784
There was a tea infuser that eforia

917
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,064
And

918
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,856
Man that guy was a TV evangelist

919
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:22,464
They it's a very Sleek looking very Apple looking they call it a Tesla tea maker

920
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:27,072
That device that supposedly makes a way better

921
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,352
A cup of tea

922
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,912
It'll know if they comes in pods

923
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
You tap it to the top

924
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:37,568
You dump your loose leaf in and then it knows from reading a pod what kind of tea it is what temperature the water

925
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,616
Beyond all this other extraction stuff

926
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,664
So it creates a more complex

927
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
Tea

928
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,016
Which sounds great I drink tea I mostly drink just kind of

929
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:49,856
Straight up PG tips cuz I love that black iced tea in the morning

930
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,160
So I'm not like a connoisseur

931
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,976
And I'm intrigued by but it's also it's

932
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,024
649 / 700 box

933
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,840
Like that's a lot of a big ass

934
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,144
For a device that dispenses tea

935
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,776
It is yet I actually met two people at the show who tried the tea and Ashley

936
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,056
Put money down and bought it

937
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,872
Oh yeah I remember talking to one of those guys I got one

938
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,664
Wow

939
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,784
He's like what he was breaking it down right like if I get seven uses out of it or if I get

940
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,624
You know a hundred uses out of it at seven bucks a t which I guess if you do

941
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,904
Kind of the macro

942
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,976
The big picture on it I guess you could do that but it's still just like

943
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,256
Wow that's a lot of money

944
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:34,400
The other that I'm I'm actually curious about it from my family might be worth the money as the coffee maker

945
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,448
Can you put green beans in

946
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
Not green beans

947
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,264
Not like string beans

948
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
But like you put

949
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,568
Yeah green coffee beans in

950
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,640
It roasts and Brews the coffee for you

951
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,920
Again

952
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,480
Customizing it to your particular taste

953
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,552
This is the cellar coffee maker and is not available

954
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
This is

955
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:59,488
This coffee maker looks like it was extruded from like a spaceship man that it's it's very pretty it has literally no

956
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:03,584
No button switch me that's a deal-breaker for me cuz you can only control it from your app but

957
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,632
And not like present-day spaceships

958
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,680
Spike future spaceships that are all

959
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,752
Cool looking I was going to say like mid-century modern spaceship

960
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,544
Beautiful design

961
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,360
Tamara 2001 right

962
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,920
So so yes

963
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:22,272
I am with you I am intrigued by the coffee maker as well I don't know how much it cost

964
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,320
Alright well let's hit your platform

965
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,160
I'm texting question and I've listened to your guys's show for a long time

966
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,952
Somebody even say I was there at the beginning

967
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,304
Thank you Chris somebody to say that you

968
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,864
Pushed us to start the show against our will

969
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
I did

970
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,680
Because I had to

971
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,216
Turn the Sala. Make it all about me

972
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:45,312
The platform questions so when I get to the Amazon Echo

973
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:50,944
Right or in this is something that you guys have touched on a lot which is what's going to communicate with

974
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,016
What other things what platforms are going to survive

975
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:58,368
And I look at the Amazon Echo and I think that's really neat and if I can connect it

976
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,672
Giganta like some kind of visual dashboard

977
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,744
I could see that being really useful at the conductor in the kitchen

978
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,304
But I don't need it I don't have Amazon music

979
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,864
I have Amazon Prime video

980
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,936
Which might be interesting but I don't really want that in the kitchen

981
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
And you know I'm

982
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,520
I'm on an iOS

983
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,616
Where does it get to with the do I have to create a separate

984
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:24,480
Ecosystem in my kitchen that Amazon between Dash buttons and Echo

985
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,552
Or we know how does this all tie in together

986
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
That

987
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,392
That fits into my life in a way that's going to stick around

988
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
Would that be be

989
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
Echo

990
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,232
Babe

991
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,584
That is one of those niggling awful questions

992
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,120
And if we're lucky

993
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,936
It will all just work itself out and work

994
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,728
If we're unlucky

995
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,520
Which is where we are right now

996
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,568
You're going to be stuck

997
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,592
Dealing

998
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,360
With

999
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,663
A bunch of devices

1000
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,711
That only talked to each other

1001
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,991
What's a lot of work

1002
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,783
Or don't talk to each other at all

1003
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,319
And

1004
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
It's going to stink

1005
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:08,255
And that's a terrible question I mean that's a terrible answer to your totally legit question in this is why consumers have not yet adopted

1006
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
Like a lot of faces

1007
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,399
Because I could almost see you like I can

1008
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,983
I almost see Amazon being the echo system in my kitchen

1009
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,799
Because it's also tied into my shopping

1010
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:24,895
And then I almost feel like I'm going to have apple for my entertainment because I'm already

1011
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,199
Kind of deep in with the entertainment

1012
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,991
With the movies and stuff

1013
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,271
In the living room

1014
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,039
Through them

1015
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,343
Okay so you got Amazon in the kitchen

1016
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,879
Apple in the living room

1017
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
And then

1018
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,463
Lord only knows what is send the rest of your house

1019
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,279
Well right now it's a giant mess

1020
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,559
Okay well

1021
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:47,423
I'm glad that we've settled you know at least two rooms and it maybe you'll have a magic

1022
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
Bridge between

1023
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:54,335
Well the one bridge that I do like the true play came out today that you play software update for the Sonos

1024
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,151
This is why I love

1025
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
My Sonos

1026
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,503
And I'm really excited cuz they did they trueplay witch

1027
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,575
Optimizes the sound in your room

1028
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,367
Based on where you place the speaker

1029
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:10,719
Until I ran through and did it this morning walking around my house waiting my phone up and down

1030
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,023
With a microphone aimed at the speaker 2

1031
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,303
Optimize my phone

1032
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,143
Arabic crestfallen when it said you're serious placements fine

1033
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,215
We made a couple of Minor Adjustments but don't worry about it

1034
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,031
OC I'll have to go do this

1035
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
Yes cuz I was really excited about this

1036
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,127
So I will

1037
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
Can't wait

1038
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:33,759
I'm I will also go and download the true play update on my Sonos has

1039
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,551
Maybe I will

1040
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
Does it adapt

1041
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,415
The speakers or does it tell you to place them in a better spot

1042
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:46,815
What it just says place just because we're going to play some so I have one in the kitchen and then one in kind of living room area

1043
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,119
And there different sections of the house

1044
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:49,887
And

1045
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,679
It says it shows you a video

1046
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,983
How to waive your phone up and down

1047
00:43:55,263 --> 00:44:01,151
Sound and you walk around the room where you listen to the music waving your phone up and down in like a wave like a sine wave or whatever

1048
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,199
And then it did

1049
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,503
Use the microphone in your phone to adjust

1050
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,551
The speaker settings

1051
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,087
And

1052
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,135
Yeah I buy Bentley my placement is just

1053
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,415
All right

1054
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,695
