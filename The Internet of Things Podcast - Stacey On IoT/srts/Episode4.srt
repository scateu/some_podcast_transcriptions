8
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:12,800
The 4th

9
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,592
Internet

10
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,408
You can see I'm going to say it two more times

11
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,528
Three episodes of for next week so we probably V

12
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,320
That is counting it's so easy

13
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,648
See if only I messed up on the 3rd be

14
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,416
Because then I could do

15
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,720
But no

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,560
Note 5 No 3

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,120
I can't it's for

18
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,144
Okay

19
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,264
So this week we have some exciting things for people who like to get outside in the

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
Springtime and garden

21
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,128
We have the launch of a really cool

22
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,152
I think it's really cool

23
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
Cool product Kevin

24
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:56,064
I just don't have a need for this but I know a lot of people would appreciate

25
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:01,184
C i I don't actually have a huge need for it because my yard is there Escape

26
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,000
Where's my daughter closet xeriscaped

27
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,048
Since I live in Texas which is

28
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
Excuse Lee drought-prone

29
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:12,448
I have basically a bunch of decorative rocks and some succulent cactuses in my yard

30
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,032
But I do have this tiny little patch in the back

31
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
It has like

32
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,128
Things that I like to grow like herbs

33
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,664
Make a shrub

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
Lovely shrub

35
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
That's nice

36
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
It's your likes better than a rock

37
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,064
Because if it's a little bit of greenery

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,856
So this product is called

39
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
The Eden

40
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,440
It was eating and there's two products

41
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
There is

42
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,256
A garden sensor & water valve

43
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
Anasazi dyn

44
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Yes

45
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Eden

46
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
So

47
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,656
Play I'm sure

48
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,704
Are the proverbial Eden Hazard

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Garden of

50
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
And what this is

51
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,104
It is one of the connected

52
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,896
Sensors for

53
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
Your garden

54
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,968
Unlike many of the kind of

55
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,528
Older generation sensors for your garden

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
This

57
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,832
The Stars more

58
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
Is it smarter

59
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
It's two pieces

60
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,440
Is there is a garden center

61
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
The Texas oil data

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
Weather data

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
The weather today

64
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
From your phone

65
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,192
And then the water valve connects to

66
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
A source of water

67
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,384
Maurice sprinkler system and turns in allows you to shut it on and off as needed

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Basically

69
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
You pop this in the ground

70
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
And it says

71
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,296
Your soil is this kind of soil

72
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
You should add more of this

73
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,928
Because your soil needs more worm casings or alfalfa sprouts

74
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
Composter

75
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
I don't know things that make

76
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
Make your soil better

77
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,144
Then you can plant the following kinds of plants in the soil based on these weather conditions that you have in your hardiness Zone

78
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
Can you tell that I'm like a half

79
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
Parted Gardener here

80
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:56,128
Yeah but you know what you're you're hitting the high point of his father's because it doesn't just take the data and say

81
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,456
Your soil pH is too high or too low go do this

82
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
It goes a lot further because it says

83
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,624
These are the types of plants that you should be planning in your garden such as for vegetables fruits herbs Etc

84
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,024
It's taking all the data from the sensors which are light humidity temperature soil nutrition Etc

85
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,864
Telling you you're at a very low level

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
What you should be planting which is I like

87
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
Yes I was here tells you at a high level

88
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,032
As opposed to the low cuz a lot of products tell you like

89
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,104
They give you like he's beautiful charts where you're just like

90
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
Wow

91
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,736
I can see my pH going from day to day and then you're like

92
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528
Wow I don't know what

93
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
What to do with that

94
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
This is just like you.

95
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
Judging by this you should plant League

96
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Here likes

97
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
Sweet

98
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,816
You're like what what if I want to plant strawberries

99
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,864
I don't know if I say to it

100
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
I imagine if I said to it

101
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
Give him where I live I want to plant strawberries it would be like

102
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Just don't do it

103
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,032
Yeah

104
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
I mean if it's not on the list of

105
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,432
Things that would thrive in your soil in your environment if I would even show it so

106
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
But it would be kind of need

107
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
If it could say you know

108
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
If you want to plant this

109
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
You should probably add

110
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,856
Like if there are things you want to

111
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
To do and could live

112
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
If you added like

113
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
Things that are atom

114
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Hannibal Lecter

115
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
Or

116
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
Sure if you make your soil just

117
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
A little bit more

118
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Kriti

119
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Vikriti I mean

120
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Bad things

121
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
It rained a little bit

122
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,543
Then you could totally do that

123
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
I like this

124
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
It

125
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,639
Is available on pre-order

126
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
It will start shipping in

127
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
Spring 25th

128
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
I feel that it is

129
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:45,439
Start shipping what's the cost on this I was just about to tell you that

130
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
Eden Garden Center

131
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
9999

132
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,375
And Eden water valve cost 5999

133
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:00,031
So that get you started and they're saying One sensors good for about 250 square feet

134
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:04,383
So if you have multiple watering Zone to me anymore sensor so I totally understand that

135
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,199
These are wifi-connected and it looks like they

136
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,087
Only work is only works with an IOS app from what I can see but I'm not 100% sure on that

137
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
What I

138
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,671
I like and you mentioned an x-ray before the show

139
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,487
Being a big solar panel guy I like the fact that there are

140
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
What looks to be solar

141
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,119
Small solar cells on top of all these sensors and such

142
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,191
There are these oh yeah these are powered

143
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Their power.

144
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Their own

145
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
So I like the fact that

146
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Take them out there in

147
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
And they do their thing

148
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
It does look like a

149
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Gets iOS

150
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
Which is really sad

151
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
Cuz I was thinking of

152
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Purchasing me

153
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,039
Yeah I mean

154
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,647
This is typical right now in the industry has been for years and not terribly surprised

155
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,207
I respect that if they

156
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,351
Near do well in selling these products still have enough funds to devote resources towards putting an Android app together

157
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,935
Again I'm assuming I'm only saying iOS on their site

158
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,007
It doesn't say in the FAQ is or anything about

159
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
About this

160
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,847
It also says an epic use that there is a battery

161
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,663
Setting is both have solar power in the backup

162
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
Right right

163
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,807
And they aren't they said they plan to open up their API to third-party developers next year

164
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
Which

165
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
There could be some interesting Integrations coming

166
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
I'm trying to think

167
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
What I would want

168
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:28,351
Oh when my son pulls home and the driver walks down the driveway I love to have the water going to be great

169
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,727
Motion sensor TP TP your house

170
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,287
Between the hours of

171
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,079
Light Em Up with the hose

172
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,895
Go eat and go

173
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:46,527
Yeah I bought it for my garden really I bought if it's soaked the kids when they

174
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Sorry

175
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,903
I can see it that's true I like your neighbor who always has their dog

176
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,559
Poop in your yard but you're going to pay for it

177
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
I wasn't even thinking about that

178
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,911
When I have an iPhone maybe I'll

179
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
No no

180
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,263
I'm sure that's not worth the investment is today

181
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,567
So that is your spring gardening

182
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
Update kind of product

183
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
Anthony Eden

184
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,967
I will look for that and if anyone tries it out let me know

185
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
I will be excited

186
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
To hear your

Your take on that and if you want to send us a

188
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,159
Actually a tip or email you can just send it to info

189
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
At iot podcast. Com

190
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,583
Yeah we've had one for a while I just have enough shared it

191
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631
We are Towing real legit

192
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:39,519
Hopes I'm finding this out as you are I mean this is breaking news breaking news last week

193
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,079
Now this week we have an email

194
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Stay tuned

195
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
What else might we go

196
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:50,527
Alright animated gifs on her website

197
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
We could do

198
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
Sprinkler gone off on the kids

199
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,439
You set that up Kevin and then we'll go

200
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,023
I do know what actually I'm going to try to set up this is going to be

201
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
I think my husband

202
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
He listens to the podcast

203
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
But I don't think he ever goes this

204
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
For Father's Day

205
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,007
I want to set up this is probably way TMI but

206
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,103
Are you going to order a hue light for inside of our bathroom

207
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
Because we have like

208
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
In our master bath we have like a little toilet

209
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
Bright

210
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
We didn't put an outlet in for a night light

211
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
So

212
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,135
You know if you're in the middle of the night and have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night

213
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,487
You have to go ahead and turn the lights so bright here like oh my God what's happening

214
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
So I realize

215
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,327
I don't know why it took me this long to realize but

216
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
I'm in install a hue light

217
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
Cuz there's a download

218
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,239
So I'm going to install the $60 hue light

219
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
In a little motion detector

220
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
Andra set it up for your SmartThings

221
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
So during the day

222
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,711
Can you set off the motion detector the light is just going to go on

223
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,759
So you no longer need to hit the light switch

224
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,111
Might just goes on but after about 10

225
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
30 at night

226
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,487
Then when you go in I'm going to set the Hue to go to a red light

227
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
Light because red light doesn't wake people

228
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
Pull up

229
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,631
So I'm going to set it to go to kind of a lower red light

230
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,703
So then you can still see but it's not going to be like

231
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
I'm awake

232
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
It is 4 in the morning

233
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
That's better than I

234
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,943
Stop what you're going to do with it I thought you're going to different colors to Signal what you did in the bathroom or something

235
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,503
Okay. See that's just that's just way too much

236
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,903
I'm just saying you know it's what you talked about the changing the light colors on the Hue of the time I was like where she going with us

237
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,487
But no the red light works actually when I go out stargazing and such I have

238
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
Red film covers for over my flashlight and such for that very reason

239
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,375
You don't want to lose your night vision

240
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
Which is very important you're sleeping

241
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
Except when I'm going to the bathroom

242
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
So this way

243
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
It's more important

244
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
Now there's the too much info

245
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Okay

246
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
So

247
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,015
That's that's my plan I'm going to set it up I don't think I'm going to tell him

248
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
And then

249
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
So one night he

250
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
He's just going to

251
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
What just happened

252
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
That might wake him up

253
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
But then I think he'll be

254
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,791
You might want to tell him it's okay

255
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
Really he's going to be happy

256
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
He may not even notice

257
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,655
I mean that would be ideal

258
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
SS

259
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Awake

260
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
I don't know I'm released

261
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,615
So there we go cuz that's like I already have a motion detector and not using

262
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,175
What's the cost of a $60 light bulb Plus

263
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
Maybe five

264
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247
The 10 minutes of programming that

265
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
It's just simple

266
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
Like after between the hours of 10 in like

267
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
6 in the morning

268
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
My son is red color

269
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
The time and

270
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
That way we don't have to flip a switch on and off

271
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
So

272
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,071
That's going to be I was going to do it for Father's Day

273
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
But maybe I'll do it too

274
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
All right

275
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
Speaking of like

276
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
Crazy home lighting

277
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
I did it I talked about lighting

278
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,591
I'm sorry you would

279
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,407
Even before the show

280
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:03,807
Let me let me give people just a little bit of the back infect side information here before the show we talk about what we're going to talk about on the show

281
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,903
And as soon as they see gets on the Skype I'm like okay so what light bulbs did you try this week

282
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Google

283
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:14,303
I did you know I was expecting some new light bulbs but they haven't arrived yet so next week

284
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
Next week

285
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
These are these

286
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
Supposed to be like awesome you

287
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
Internet of Lights Show

288
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,007
It's true I'm not even going to light Fair

289
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,799
So there we go

290
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,847
Imagine if I went to that you guys

291
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
Okay so

292
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Speaking of life

293
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,967
For the last week I've been controlling my lights

294
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
From my

295
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
On which is not

296
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
Unusual

297
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,855
What is unusual I've been controlling it

298
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
From to new apps that let me

299
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
Basically

300
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Control

301
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
From the lock screen

302
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
Of my Android

303
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Ice

304
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,375
We've actually talked about one of these on the show

305
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
It is old Incarnation when

306
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,799
What is an app called you know me and you guys may remember it because it woke me up at midnight playing

307
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
My radio

308
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Because I thought I came

309
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
I'm home

310
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
The fix

311
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Fat

312
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
With an update

313
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
So that that's good

314
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,599
But the new one I wanted to cut a dick into is called reach

315
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
And

316
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,207
It's on Android only right now so this

317
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
If you got an iOS I'm sorry just

318
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Fast forward this

319
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
But basically what it does it's

320
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Supports

321
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
Wi-Fi devices for the most part

322
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
And

323
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Right now in my house

324
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
It is supporting

325
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
The nest

326
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895
The hue

327
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
And

328
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
My Sonos Sonos has

329
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
But it also supports

330
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
A bunch of

331
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
Other devices that I don't have

332
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
And what's cool about it is

333
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,951
Whenever you walk into a place that has anything

334
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:51,071
These devices it will automatically detect them on the Wi-Fi network and I'll be like hey yo do you want to connect

335
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,679
And these devices are a Chromecast anything made by LG

336
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
Make a smart TV

337
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,007
Heroku lifx bulbs

338
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,079
And then the other devices that I mentioned so WeMo nest

339
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Sonos in

340
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
And she likes

341
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,199
I will say I've been having issues with my nest

342
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,759
It keeps making me link my account

343
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
I'm so

344
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
Every couple days it's like

345
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,647
Oh now you need to relink your account and I think that's because it's an

346
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
Unofficial

347
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
Integration

348
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,303
So there's the benefits of being official vs. unofficial

349
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,887
But I love it because all that I do is it comes down

350
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,191
On my notification screen

351
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:34,591
And I can do it's it's very much designed for those quick things like oh someone's at my door let me just pause my

352
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
Sonos music really fast

353
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Soy

354
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,991
Pull down the notification screen and I just hit pause if you

355
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,599
Like all I see all six of my Sonos players

356
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
Back and hip pain

357
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
Or when I'm going to bed at night I just

358
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
Pull down the notification

359
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
Screen and I can

360
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
Turn off my bedside table light

361
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
With my Hue relief

362
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
It's

363
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,887
In in Granite because of

364
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,215
Because of how I live and how many things I test I have a

365
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
Dozen different ways to do a lot of these things

366
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,591
But I have to say doing it from the lock screen

367
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,663
Is really freaking sweet you guys

368
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,551
Yeah this is this is a very clever implementation I guess they're using all the apis from these various devices

369
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,647
And consolidating all the controls right into that pull down notification shade on Android

370
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:24,255
And that's just a beautiful thing I'm looking at the theater face on the Google Play Store right now this is the

371
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
Free apps in beta

372
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:30,143
I actually it took me awhile to find it it's cuz there's a lot of apps called reach

373
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,471
So if you do search do a search for reach Smart Home

374
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
Now that's where you'll find it's

375
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,335
Buildfire developer jch connected Tech

376
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
Ink

377
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
And yeah I mean

378
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,967
Stacy it showed it to me on a Skype video chat

379
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
Not too long ago and

380
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,879
You know I got to see an action was kind of neat now it recognizes and finds all the devices quickly

381
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,951
Just looks really clean and it's the consolidation

382
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:59,327
You know I talked about using a phone to connect to all these devices and control them I actually like that

383
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,399
Do I like doing all these different apps new I do not sow

384
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:07,775
This is I like this idea and because it is almost like a widget in a sentence

385
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
It is

386
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,151
Yeah because it is I wouldn't surprise me I don't see it here yet

387
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
It wouldn't surprise me to see them

388
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,343
Easley Portis over to Android Wear watches and if they ever come out with iOS version again on the Apple watch where are you

389
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,415
Have all those things within you know an easy swipe away

390
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,255
In the wealth are there going to be doing an iOS version

391
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,559
And they they are looking at

392
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,119
Their whole goal is to do

393
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,679
Is to not replicate all the features

394
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
It is to do something that is

395
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
It is to do the quick features

396
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,639
In the easiest format so they are very much looking at watches

397
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
Is there very much

398
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Looking at

399
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
Easy ways

400
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
Things outside of screens

401
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Rhino

402
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:57,439
You're getting your not it doesn't give total control over all these devices what you have is the most likely things are going to

403
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,255
I want to do with them turn them on turn them off as such if it's a light

404
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,655
Play or pause on a Sonos or change the volume on a Chromecast you know something you're streaming to a Chromecast

405
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,263
So like the simplistic idea because it's quick one

406
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
Pull-down and you're there

407
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Yes

408
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
And I love it

409
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
So

410
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
I've been having a lot of fun with it

411
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
The first time

412
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
It in it

413
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,503
Again it's in beta it's gotten

414
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
Progressively better

415
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,599
Like the first time I downloaded it oh my God it crashed ever

416
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Every 5 Seconds

417
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,159
Now it's very rarely cry

418
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,231
I'm so if you're on an Android

419
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,535
And you like to play around with this stuff

420
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
And you have a lot of

421
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
These devices

422
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
I highly recommend you give this

423
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
Because it is

424
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
I'm not going to say is change my life

425
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
It is a lot of fun to play with

426
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
It is definitely something I'm using

427
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
Everyday

428
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
So

429
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Check it out

430
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
And on the

431
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
You know me friend

432
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,015
They have fixed a lot of there

433
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,319
Issues with the geolocation

434
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,927
So they added official geolocation so now you're not getting all these reminders like

435
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,791
You left the house when you're really still in the house and it's just your Wi-Fi network that's flickered

436
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
They've kind of

437
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,143
Twitter support for

438
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
A lot of their devices so it's

439
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Much better

440
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,079
And did my final thing on all of this stuff that I would say is

441
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,663
I'm going to beg the guys over at WeMo

442
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
You

443
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
You guys need to work

444
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
On your API

445
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
I

446
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,391
I've talked to a lot of people in the deaf community and

447
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,183
And as someone who owns the WeMo Staffing

448
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
Is connecting it to a lot of things

449
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,815
I'm getting progressively more frustrated as a user

450
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
Because

451
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,399
My WeMo doesn't know if it's on or off

452
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,959
And the more things I connected to

453
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,983
The harder it's

454
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Becoming for it to know

455
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
What

456
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
State of being is

457
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,639
And that's that's becoming very frustrating for me

458
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,711
One solution is obviously like

459
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
Hey Stacy

460
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,807
Maybe you shouldn't connect it to the reach app and to the echo

461
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,879
And to the SmartThings app and to all these other thing

462
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
But

463
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,487
I don't know if that's really anti if

464
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,535
Bissonnet and

465
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,375
You're you're not the typical person that is

466
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
You know

467
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:19,263
Is that is out there buying is priced you're trying them all and you're trying to make them all work together

468
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:24,127
You know for a cover it because we talked about it cuz you have to understand it

469
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
So

470
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
I can understand you know

471
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,551
I can't do but even on this richat for example the WeMo

472
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,879
The WeMo implementation is a little frustrating

473
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,183
For even the developers be

474
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
Because

475
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
It's kind of a Dodge

476
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
It's a little iffy on the

477
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Annotation size

478
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
And for the echo people

479
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,703
Again they have some issues and Isis

480
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
Suspect there issues

481
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
With it sometimes working in

482
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
And sometimes not working

483
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,639
Not just because I've gotten the code word strong which is another issue

484
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
Is because

485
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
Of the

486
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
API

487
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,039
So I'm trying to get the

488
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,111
Go to talk to me cuz I know they've been trying to revamp their API

489
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
So

490
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
I'm hoping that this

491
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,463
Coming down the pike but I would really like

492
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
As a ninja

493
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
Because

494
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
I know that I try every

495
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,119
Everything out but I think a lot of people are connecting

496
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,031
What's with this way when you start connecting one or two things in your house and then there's all these other products

497
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:28,383
You're going to want to look and see what else you can fit into your environment so I get that I do

498
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,687
Connecting light

499
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
If this then that

500
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,551
Yeah that be fun and then maybe you're like maybe if WeMo doesn't work

501
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Swift nest

502
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
Then suddenly you're like

503
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
Yep and if they don't work or

504
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
I agree

505
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,607
So on on that kind of Grimm note

506
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
Please WeMo help us out

507
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,239
We will leave

00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007

It's exactly iot

Cheap platforms

519
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,047
Businesses and the internet of things and

520
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,095
And of how they're starting to do some cool

521
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
Cool stuff with that

522
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:28,287
Hey everybody we are back with the Internet of Things podcast and today's guest is Michael Symon the CEO and chair

523
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,567
Chairman of log me in

524
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
Hello Michael

00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
Good morning Stacy

526
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:36,991
Good morning I am so glad to have you on the show and for those of you guys who are like

527
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,551
What is LogMeIn doing on the show

528
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
It is a cloud platform

532
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
For hosting

533
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,767
Hosting internet-of-things type services

534
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,863
Michael probably has a better way to describe that you want if you want to give it a go

535
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,191
Sure

536
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
LogMeIn makes

537
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,287
And by product I mean it

538
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
Microservices

539
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,639
Esl to

540
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
Companies

541
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,223
Or trying to sell ship

542
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
Iot products

543
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,087
If I can make him

544
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,672
Example home lighting

545
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
Decade

546
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,792
I want to have iot interactive home lighting

547
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,400
Technology that needs to be implemented to make that all work

548
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,496
And I was in the business of delivering.

549
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,336
Alright guys you heard him he brought up lighting I did not

550
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,176
All right so you actually have done a great

551
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
Job

552
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,224
Explaining to me

553
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,248
Your customer base

554
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
And in doing so

555
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
You actually help me

556
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:49,952
Kind of segments the iot market for businesses and I'd love for you to do that for our idea

557
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
So

558
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,816
You guys provide your service to a certain kind of

559
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
The clientele

560
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,168
And it's those companies that offer

561
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,752
An existing service and by making it connected they actually

562
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Can help

563
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
Basically do it better and hopefully

564
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
Increase their profits

565
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,944
And maybe even make it cheaper for their end customers

566
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
Can you kind of talk to me about

567
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
The low-hanging fruit

568
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,320
For a connected service busy

569
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,232
You are so pretty clear distinction between

570
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,072
A product that is connected to the internet

571
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,912
And a what we call a connected product business

572
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,224
HP printers have been connected to the internet for years

573
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,040
No not not really

574
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
And

575
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
Connected product business

576
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,976
It's really defined by the notion

577
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,536
That you have a product

578
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,584
Yeah but user a customer

579
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,144
And you have the company itself

580
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:06,240
And I cannot katanick business there still ongoing

581
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,544
Lillian and during relationship

582
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,080
Between those three

583
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
Call parties

584
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
And it's not just

585
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
Employee

586
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,456
Oh that the company

587
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
Keep tabs on

588
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,784
What's going on it's actually that

589
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,160
I have in that relationship significant

590
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,208
Product

591
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,744
Stan's Lee better

592
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,608
I actually having that ongoing relationship

593
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,936
Walk-in any company

594
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,728
That has

595
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,776
Needs for Logistics

596
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,824
Delivery Maybe

597
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,920
Replacement replenishment apart like a filter

598
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,992
It is a perfect candidate for a knife

599
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:55,392
So you can imagine something as simple as that

600
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:59,232
Well I'm at a secure place you can throw papers though

601
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,608
Pretty simple business and its construction

602
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,632
The devices

603
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:09,984
South Bend has been which is kind of like a garbage can with a lock on it

604
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,080
Is not terribly high-tech and its construction

605
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,896
But you can imagine if I added

606
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,272
That was at work when not being is full

607
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
It could be a substantially better service

608
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:30,720
They won't have to ever worry about it overflowing and

609
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,768
Full capacity

610
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,816
At the same time

611
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,352
The company stand

612
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:41,984
I actually was damaged dramatically reduced

613
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
Collier service

614
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,848
Yesterday told the company when they're full

615
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:51,456
I couldn't do a better job of sending people to service an empty those then

616
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,272
In a way that is

617
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,088
Better balance between producing cost

618
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,672
I also have the same time has a high quality of service

619
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,000
And those types of business there's this

620
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:09,120
Lily

621
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:15,776
I feel like this the sooner they can become

622
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,592
Sure and you guys have been doing this for

623
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,128
For several years and

624
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,712
I can think there vending machine companies there restaurants

625
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,992
I rather

626
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,576
There companies that monitor like refrigerators and restaurants there

627
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,368
You're right there's scads

628
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
And

629
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,464
In the years that you guys have been doing this

630
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,256
What is the evolution that you

631
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,024
Senior

632
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Customers

633
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:44,192
Like do they call you and they're like I have just read about the internet of things and now I'm a shredding company and I want

634
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,288
Modules on my trash can that enable me to do like

635
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,104
Just in time truck rolls or is it a little

636
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,384
Bit more

637
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
Gradual

638
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,944
What is the evolution of

639
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,992
The connected business

640
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,368
Heating pad

641
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,928
CNN it's it's interesting

642
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,864
Acog scope of companies we interact with

643
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:19,264
Industrial Light industrial applications to Pure consumer

644
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,336
Smart

645
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,664
Country that makes Smart products

646
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:30,016
Life Sciences company

647
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:34,880
And even though the businesses are very very different

648
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:39,232
I'm sort of the evolution of

649
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,280
The company's thinking on iot

650
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,888
Usually follows a similar path

651
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,680
Products be better

652
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:51,264
Maybe by having the product in Iraq

653
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:56,128
With an iPhone on an iPhone or an Android phone

654
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,480
User interface therefore be a better product

655
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,064
Step One is awesome you just won

656
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,112
The product could be a little bit better

657
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:10,208
And we think we can do that by having it in Mobile

658
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
We have to have a

659
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
Dive lyrics

660
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,096
Connectivity

661
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
Share that belief

662
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,872
Until what they start saying is all right well then how come

663
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
It's not the better product

664
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:33,248
To make the business better how can you improve the quality of service

665
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,296
How can you get smarter

666
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,600
About how people interact

667
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,536
Sometimes hear that

668
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,096
Data is the currency of the IMT

669
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,680
Metaphase 2 and how can we

670
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,704
Suddenly

671
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,752
You get much more

672
00:27:55,008 --> 00:28:00,896
Intelligent about the needs of our customers when you start engaging and having relationship with them

673
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,296
Commanded that information

674
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,368
It's at the data self can be overwhelming

675
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,232
A shocking amount of data can be produced

676
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:19,584
How you actually what you collect when you collect and how to ensure that

677
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,632
Properly secured

678
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:26,752
Why the Sears is addressed properly there's a data management

679
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,616
All right

680
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,176
Are we going to

681
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
Integrate

682
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,504
Are connected products

683
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,064
In our overall business includes

684
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,672
Integration inside Legacy business Information Systems

685
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:49,792
Erp system Salesforce

686
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,352
Others business integration

687
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,424
Also going to need to engage

688
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:59,776
Your lisp with my products customers and partners overtime

689
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,824
The way back

690
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
Halogen

691
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
And then

692
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,200
Price value both to the customer and upon the company

693
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,016
So we really see this

694
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,576
Trajectory from can we make it work

695
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,392
How do we get smarter than

696
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,720
Finally

697
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,024
Overtime not not just

698
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
Launch button

699
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,864
One year two year five years

700
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
And how

701
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,424
How long does this

702
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Take

703
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
The evolution from

704
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:34,336
Hey I just I want to add a feature to my iPhone to suddenly realizing

705
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:38,432
Oh my gosh I've got all this data in realizing that I am now

706
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,968
Not just a product

707
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,016
For a services company but I am a

708
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,296
Connected company

709
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,624
So icy

710
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,024
When we sit down with us

711
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,816
Customer Prospect

712
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,144
We try and walk them through this process

713
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,384
If you could come to the top once it's kind of not that hard if you

714
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
Come over a little

715
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:15,552
I wonder how much further it is to go

716
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,344
We're trying to be a guy

717
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,392
Are the journey for a lot of our customers

718
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:26,304
People's own devices is that that process of discovery

719
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
Can be anywhere

720
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:32,448
From the day they go live for the first time

721
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,592
Within a few months people suddenly realized potential

722
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
Energy that is

723
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,920
That comes with a connected

724
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:48,576
Opportunities and obligations

725
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,112
Pretty quickly

726
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,392
Arjen Robben

727
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,440
Is to make them easier and faster

728
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
Okay

729
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:58,560
And as you said I am a big believer that data is the currency of the internet

730
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
It's the value

731
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,656
So

732
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,704
You guys just launched a

733
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,032
A new version of ivory that has a really interesting product

734
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
Is part of it called blueprint

735
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,432
And when I saw it I thought hey this is the compliance section

736
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,224
Which for a lot of Enterprises

737
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,992
This really important

738
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,808
And for the Internet of Things is

739
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,600
It's incredibly important because this is

740
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,880
This is all about

741
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,928
Being able to

742
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,488
For lack of a better word tagged data

743
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
With permissions with

744
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
Rolls

745
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,144
Sue an accountant can access this data

746
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
This customer

747
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,496
Created this data

748
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,568
They're permissions associated with it are

749
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
As follows

750
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,664
It's it's a very complicated thing when we think about

751
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
You know

752
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:51,296
Permissions associated with the customer who's granting the permissions

753
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,088
Who at which companies

754
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,880
To have access to the data

755
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
Can access it

756
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
Which companies can access it

757
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
So

758
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,256
In building that

759
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
Why did you guys kind of

760
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
Create that

761
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
How does that relate to

762
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
The stages of the business

763
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,728
UC

764
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
Companies going through

765
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,848
I actually

766
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:19,968
It's awesome, customer standpoint it's maybe

767
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,296
Started their Journey

768
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,624
And gosh I was going to manage that once we go live until

769
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,952
Blueprints weekly just rolled out this week

770
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
And

771
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,792
It was in response to sorted

772
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:37,376
Repeating pattern that results of unmet needs

773
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
Ark Center customer base

774
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:45,312
Blueprint what it is that allows our costumes

775
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,872
Camaster business are clouds

776
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,992
Place to capture and manage basically all the roles

777
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,880
And permissions throughout connected business from the employees in the business to the products

778
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:03,488
To the customers to Partners you might service Buzz bottle

779
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,072
In a sense of place where a lousy one

780
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,864
Who are all the parties agents

781
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,168
Actors in my connected business

782
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,216
To what what do they do

783
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
How do they interact

784
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,848
I'm with each other what's the relationship you had each other

785
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,920
Then what is there air rights

786
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,200
And

787
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
So

788
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,760
Blueprint is a place

789
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,808
You can say all right

790
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:31,392
Customer is allowed to interact

791
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,464
A certain product

792
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,048
A particular

793
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,632
It also might have in it that

794
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,704
She can't interact with that same color in that

795
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,776
But a service agency

796
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,616
It's its roles Commissions in relationships

797
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:57,248
Access to devices

798
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,040
Access to data

799
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:02,880
Because the data that is generated by the iot

800
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,440
Is in enormous in its volume

801
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,976
But also has

802
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:11,072
There's a real need to be able to manage it and away

803
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:15,424
So that through the the life of that information

804
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,704
It is

805
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,544
Protected if you will and associated

806
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:26,688
With the right people are not inadvertently shared with those who we shouldn't have access to it

807
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,784
Blueprint in the case of data needs conscious

808
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:38,976
And and her diving system important part of it

809
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:43,840
Gratitude assembly cache and data that then you have to sort out in the future

810
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:48,704
Taxi capturing data that has gluten in it

811
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
So bad

812
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,800
That information is easy to make sense of

813
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:57,920
The Seattle Center

814
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,016
In building that

815
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,552
It sounds like a huge

816
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,088
A huge job

817
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,672
How did you guys kind of think about architecting

818
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,720
Which handles

819
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,280
I don't know I don't know you'll have to tell me how many

820
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,816
Hundreds of thousands of nodes

821
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:20,448
And then in building kind of what sounds like a huge kind of Knowledge Graph

822
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
Relationships in

823
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Data

824
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,848
How did you design the system because that is a

825
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:32,736
Problem that a lot of companies who are dealing with the Internet of Things in the back end of that are thinking about in

826
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,064
It's really not something that we've established, Target

827
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,608
And what what makes it technically challenging

828
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,936
It's just the scale

829
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:56,800
How much information and how many devices are interacting

830
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,640
I normally would never have any reason

831
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,968
You're the largest Enterprises in the world might have

832
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,808
Few hundred thousand employees and they might have

833
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,208
Seven-figure is about interacting with their mostly desktop

834
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:21,120
And so the notion of devices connected

835
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,824
Since 2004

836
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,640
I've been running and service back

837
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:38,784
Total connected over 300 million devices

838
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,880
Avenue neighborhood

839
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160
Mom cell

840
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,464
We are getting exposed to that

841
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,792
Years and years

842
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,072
Feeling back

843
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,864
Laird

844
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,424
We have to build and implement

845
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,824
Getting data from two devices

846
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:14,112
And so we build our while we have mqtt a Mexican compliant

847
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
Solution

848
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:21,536
It's actually built on the data brokerage system that reviews

849
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:30,752
That are built on

850
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,824
Securely got a brokerage system

851
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,640
The anchor tenant

852
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
But on top of that

853
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:48,160
Things like blueprints

854
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:52,000
Capturing time series data capture

855
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
I really felt

856
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,584
Off-the-shelf database

857
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,936
Technologies

858
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
And

859
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,032
There's not the Technologies office

860
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,336
How to deploy it

861
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:10,944
It it really had to

862
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:17,600
That you have mourned

863
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:29,120
Can you do the bathroom

864
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,192
And what were

865
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,472
Focused on

866
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,800
It's not simply doesn't work but doesn't work

867
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,176
When we did send a message we have to

868
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:47,040
Authenticate that message in real time

869
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
Ambi

870
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:54,976
Can certain people and they have lights receive that message

871
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,048
And then transmitted I have to do that all

872
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:05,472
Custom systems for data ingestion custom systems

873
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,360
And Andrew optimizing together in such a way that

874
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,456
Low latency delivery messages

875
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:21,344
Are the same time Insurance Commission

876
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,160
And I believe I saw that it was sub-50 vilaseca

877
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,464
Within our data

878
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,792
Celtics

879
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:36,448
But a typical using the bathroom.

880
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,752
Oh that's all the way out to me like

881
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
At the end

882
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,824
Exactly

883
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,848
Okay

884
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,664
Well that sounds really impressive if you want to ever like

885
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,736
Show us Batman Lego engineering blog post

886
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
You know let me know

887
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
Because I am

888
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,808
I love that stuff
