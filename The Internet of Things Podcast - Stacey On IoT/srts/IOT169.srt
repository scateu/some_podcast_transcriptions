00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:26,528
Lighting security thermostats door locks music TV cameras and more work together

00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,928
Provide a smart home that's built for smart people you're home and all the connected devices in it controls

29
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
Simply and easily

30
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
Now that's smart head to control4.com that's control the number for. Com

31
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
For more information

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,496
Okay Kevin let us get started first up AT&T

33
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
Has launched

34
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,288
Or says it

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
Launch a

36
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,360
NB iot Network

37
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,176
For those of you guys who are like what what what what what

38
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,736
Nb-iot is a real

39
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,016
Low-bandwidth

40
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
Low data rate

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Relatively cheap

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
Cellular-based

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
Low-power wide are

44
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
So it's

45
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,488
Blake sick Fox's Network

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
Kind of like ingenue

47
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
It's on par with Laura

48
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
So very small

49
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
Dancer theater

50
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
Little very small

51
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
Bits of data

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,496
And presumably very cheap

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
Nb-iot has what I call crazy low data rate

54
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,408
It's like you can only send 250 kilobits per second

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
Compared to

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
1 megabit per second

57
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
LTE cat in

58
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
Network

59
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,576
And gosh I don't even know where we're at

60
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,416
It's the dial-up modem for iot

61
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
Yes

62
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
There you go

63
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,256
But it's supposed to be super cheap

64
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
The challenge with NB iot

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,096
He is you do have to buy

66
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,656
Modules in right now the industry is aiming

67
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
For $5

68
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
For a module

69
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,008
That's still super expensive

70
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
Compare light cost

71
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
Wifi chips with Bluetooth

72
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
Chips with your liking me

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Dollar

74
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
50 Cent range

75
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,248
Really cheap and when you're thinking that there's any billions of these things connecting

76
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
That's a lot of money

77
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
So they're working

78
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
I don't know when

79
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
She is doing this

80
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
This is worth noting.

81
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,208
Because Verizon

82
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
He said that they're going to do it

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
T-Mobile said that they were going to

84
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,120
Initially in the US AT&T and Verizon

85
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
We're focused on doing LT

86
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
PCAT and which has

87
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
Like I said

88
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Hire date

89
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,008
So

90
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
Europe

91
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
Asia

92
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
Like yeah nb-iot let's make it so

93
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
But in the US not so much

94
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
So much so now that

95
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
These guys are actually piggybacking on T-Mobile

96
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
Announcement doing this

97
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,808
It's worth noting

98
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
The big questions I have

99
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
Are again about module

100
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:43,488
So you're going to need this for like high-value devices that are moving all over

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
The place to think

102
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
Shipments of

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
Computing equipment

104
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,864
Pandora jewelry or

105
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Medicine

106
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
Things that

107
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
Are going to travel

108
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,728
Possibly even around the globe

109
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
But definitely

110
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
Around the country

111
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
And that it won't be cost-prohibitive

112
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
Like kind of a more expensive device

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
And more

114
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
Data plan

115
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
The other element here is the date

116
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,576
So how is AT&T going to charge people

117
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
When

118
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
Historically

119
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
They want to do these

120
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
Individual deals with

121
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
Companies in people there are

122
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,815
Companies out there like particles

123
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,863
Twilio that

124
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
Can support nb-iot

125
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
But that's

126
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
Again

127
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Question

128
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,311
I mean they can't use the traditional

129
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,711
Pricing that we use with consumers for phones and Neo data rates are phones and such because as a consumer we we have some

130
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
Super fast Wireless at this point

131
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
Pandora streaming

132
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
Big things like video

133
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,879
This is not that so

134
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,487
Yeah I don't know how they're going to do this and the kind of

135
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,279
Burns my bottom that

136
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,679
I have to pay like $10 a month for LTE service on my Apple watch because they're kind of using that old pricing

137
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
Even though my Apple watch

138
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
Only uses I checked

139
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
About a hundred

140
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
Bytes per

141
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,967
Month and yeah I'm paying $10 for that sewing up her database is it extremely expensive they cannot do this

142
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
It's never going to succeed if they do that

143
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,623
Auntie says they're going to launch vim in the US

144
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
In 2019

145
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,439
And they're going to follow it

146
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Mexico

147
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Verizon

148
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
Plans here

149
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,607
Are similar but they're doing their NBA team

150
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
Filled out

151
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
This year

152
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
And they've said they're they're going to cover

153
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
The whole country by the end of the

154
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
So

155
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,823
Yeah that is all the news we have on

156
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
Nb-iot

157
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
Low-power wide-area

158
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
At work so far

159
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,967
Let's go on to our next story which is

160
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
Play spots

161
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,575
Who is the big news this week was

162
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,599
Madam

163
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,183
Bro she is going to be in Marriott

164
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,207
Hotels there

165
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,511
Tons of Marriott brands that are going to have this

166
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
Not that I'm going to stay at

167
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:03,263
What cuz it's Marriott Hotels Westin Hotels Resorts st. Regis hotels Aloft Hotels in autograph

168
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Hotels

169
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,639
If a hotel has more than three names in it or three words and I can't afford it so yeah

170
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Okay

171
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
Some of these are super

172
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Rims for

173
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
In a couple that lived

174
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
And I've been wanting this for

175
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,671
Forever cuz every time I walk into a hotel room

176
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,487
Dust begins to search for the light switch

177
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
You're like where is it

178
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,095
Because we don't look for them at home anymore that's why

179
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
So yeah so I've wanted this

180
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,703
There's a couple things that are interesting about

181
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Marriott

182
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,775
Was actually the first company to

183
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
Hook up Netflix to

184
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,895
Your Netflix account in your hotel room Marriott

185
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
Over the last few

186
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
15 and I was a big deal

187
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
It took a lot of logistics

188
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Actually

189
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
Make sure that

190
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
When you left

191
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
Deactivated

192
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
And that's actually going to happen

193
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,047
In this case so instead of attaching to your individual Amazon

194
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,119
This is going to be a generic

195
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Hotel

196
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,447
Count in the recordings are going to be deleted every day

197
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,263
In hotels are giving it access to the Boys Room

198
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
Andrew Madoff

199
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Directions

200
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,871
But they will actually get

201
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
For the matinee for house

202
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,735
Fatality we sounds kind of like a whole little skill or action or

203
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
App even

204
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
They will

205
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
Yep the hotel will actually

206
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:29,023
Be able to measure engagement through analytics or they can do some customization by choosing like to fall

207
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
Music stations and such like

208
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Amazon

209
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:38,239
Give an example of Marriott offering TED talks on Echo devices for example Selby pre-configured which

210
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
You don't want just access or nothing

211
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,079
But eventually

212
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:47,455
This kind of concerns me eventually they're going to let you temporarily link your Amazon account

213
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,271
Better running he's mad at me for hospitality

214
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Blueprints

215
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,807
And that's

216
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:58,207
Really nice as you get customization but you got to trust that when you check out your account is automatically disc

217
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,047
Schenectady cuz that's what's going to happen you're not going to disconnect it it's going to happen

218
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Or is it

219
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
One hopes that it will

220
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,399
Because Marriott has experience with

221
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
Like I remember talking to Marriott and the Nets

222
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,007
Looks guys and they spin

223
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
A long time

224
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Making sure this

225
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Properly

226
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
And was safeguard

227
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
User info

228
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Information

229
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
Conscious

230
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
Spent a similar amount of

231
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
Worry is

232
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
There's a couple

233
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
1

234
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
Battlements

235
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
There's a lot of questions in

236
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,975
The consumers mind about privacy

237
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
Around this so I think

238
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,327
But there are plenty of people who will see this in their hotel room

239
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,655
If I were walking into a hotel room

240
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
The explicit purpose of having

241
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Affair

242
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
I would probably look askance

243
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,591
And that's because there been some weird glitches

244
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,663
Like the echo randomly recording people in

245
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
I'm thinking it hears things

246
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
But it doesn't hear

247
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
That's actually a little worrisome

248
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:59,135
And even actually in one recent case sending that conversation to contact

249
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Yeah and I try

250
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
My data believe it

251
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
Don't trust

252
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
These sorts of

253
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,607
Weird errors glitches at the stakes in some of these

254
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
Glitches

255
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
Could be high

256
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Especially Fingerhut

257
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,495
But maybe that's a good reason not to have your own account linked

258
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
Isn't the hotel just yours

259
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Amazon

260
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,943
Yeah that's the thing I don't know that I would like my own account but I would just look at it as

261
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,343
The TV that they put on there with the channels that they offer right I don't think I would log into my PlayStation Vue account

262
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,367
For example

263
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,511
Have access to my channels in my DVR stuff while on vacation it would be nice but I can do that on my my own device

264
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
Yasso

265
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
And if that's

266
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,399
We'll see how that works but I think this is a

267
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Really

268
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
Good use case for the echo

269
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,775
I know Amazon has really ambitious plans

270
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
I'm talking to

271
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,335
Across a wide variety

272
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Industries

273
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
And there are tons of Industries everyday that

274
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,271
What do you think about getting the echo at restaurants or in industrial Factory

275
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
So voice is going to be a huge

276
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
Huge deal

277
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
Everywhere in

278
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
Amazon's really doing

279
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
Good job trying to

280
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
It's funny you say that

281
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
Because

282
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,095
That was a great segue right to an article that I wrote this week

283
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,679
On basically The Madam a everywhere strategy

284
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:21,823
That I think is really helping Amazon keep its digital assistance leadership

285
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:28,479
Animes that they're doing it because unlike their competitors such as Google Apple and Microsoft

286
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,783
What do they have at Amazon doesn't have

287
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,623
They have desktop and mobile software platforms are there

288
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,951
So how is Amazon doing this right how are they stay

289
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:44,351
Granted they have first-mover status so that helps but doesn't guarantee success obviously it gets back to something you just

290
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
I said about the hotel bit

291
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Utrust

292
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
Amazon with your data

293
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
And when you look at the companies I just mentioned

294
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
Apple is up there with trust

295
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Microsoft

296
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
I would say

297
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
But Google

298
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,247
Many people are not as many people I think Trust

299
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,039
Google with their data

300
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,903
As opposed to Amazon with their data so I think that really really helps

301
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
The other thing is

302
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,535
Amazon's being very open and they have to be because the only way you're going to get this

303
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,631
Platform is a platform Developers

304
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:22,239
They've got like 11 developer kits that you can buy where is

305
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
The other folks don't

306
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:30,175
They have the most skills out there depending on who you ask and they've about 30,000 Madame a skills Google says

307
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
1000 * 1 million

308
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,783
When million actions to try

309
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,903
But that's use case if that's not actual developer actions there are only around 2,000.

310
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Directions

311
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,791
So young again Amazon is making a good play here to attract the Developers

312
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,911
Herewith building skills or routines are actions whatever you want to call them the other thing

313
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:55,263
He's really been talking about this I'll just raise it and I'm curious what you think

314
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,567
Biggest populated country on the planet

315
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
Is China

316
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,895
Who is persona non grata in China

317
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Google

318
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
Yep

319
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
Amazon

320
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,783
Granted Amazon will be competing in some very

321
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,415
Aggressive and widely available retailers that are looking to their own boss and such

322
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:17,535
So it's not a cakewalk for them but they have an opportunity to work Google have no opportunity so

323
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:22,911
I think that's going to go a long way in the future towards keeping Madame a front and center for sometime so

324
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
So that

325
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
Okay well there you go

326
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
Did not argue with you on that

327
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
So

328
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,199
But not some people might not be curious to hear some comments on a voicemail if somebody disagrees

329
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,759
There's no right answer here obviously I would love to hear people

330
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Yes

331
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
Let's talk about

332
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
Enterprise

333
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,375
So let's try to make as looking at the space there's definitely some

334
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
Actions that it's taken

335
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,519
Still kind of TVD on that that the Cortana example is when wearing

336
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
That's both interesting and

337
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
Sanitize into some of

338
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
The things you mentioned

339
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
Only it's like that frenemy

340
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Territory

341
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
Let's talk about

342
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:15,135
Yes I have not heard of Jan until I found her mention on voice bot. AI which is like my

343
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,951
My new go-to site for voice stats

344
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,487
It's really good size check it out

345
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,095
Gene is a company started by David karandash

346
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:29,983
Who is the former CEO of answers.com what do you think about it makes sense that somebody from answers.com

347
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,287
Working with an AI bought these days

348
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,639
Jane is that a I bought she is a high-powered office assistant

349
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,223
And launched about a week ago

350
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,623
The company raised 1.5 million in January 2017 to get started but they just got another 8.3 million dollars are 10

351
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
Enterprise a iPod

352
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
It's interesting because

353
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
With Jane

354
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:57,119
She can tie into your enterprise system so like you could just ask Jen what's the status of the Purina lead

355
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
That we've been working on

356
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
James Bond here's what I found in the CRM marketing department sent a proposal and expected to close on March 3rd

357
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,407
I mean you could go into your CRM system look all this up but if you can have a voice

358
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
Assistant do it for you it should be radically save a lot of time and again it's a very Enterprise AI Focus there's

359
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,599
What happening in this space all of a sudden

360
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
Hey voices

361
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,415
It is not the sole

362
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
There will be others

363
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,511
Prepare for the multimodal future Pep Boys

364
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
That's a lot of it

365
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,631
The invisible interface that everybody knows how to use

366
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,191
You just yell at it

367
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
Cheap the Enterprise

368
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
What's

369
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
HP Enterprise

370
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
Because they

371
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,503
Heaven in

372
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
Unquote intelligence

373
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
Edge Technologies

374
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
And services

375
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Over the next

376
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,415
Here's I bring this up because

377
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,463
I am super excited about

378
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
Edge computing

379
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
Element for iot

380
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,607
I know even if you're focused on smart home stuff and not thinking

381
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
About Enterprise type

382
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Examples

383
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
Not everything can go back to the

384
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
We obviously tok

385
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
Sollozzo a lot of

386
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
Computing

387
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
In processing

388
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,615
From all of the sensor data is going to happen

389
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
At what they call the edge

390
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,967
And this is a rich vein of opportunity

391
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
A lot of startups and big

392
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,599
So everyone from Intel and Cisco to hpn

393
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,391
I don't know just pick another big-name

394
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,255
Gear that is optimized

395
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,047
Data processing really quickly

396
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,351
They don't have to be low powers

397
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,423
Cuz everybody's definition of the edge is a little different soompi

398
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,519
People are like it's a sensor but most of these guys are thinking about an aggregation

399
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
That sits on a factory

400
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
Floor inside

401
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Closet and

402
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
Like a lot of this data shouldn't go up to the cloud

403
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199
Because of security or

404
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Tradesy

405
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:54,623
Rules some of its latency Centric so you can't have a factory that's like relying on data to dictate once and

406
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
Nothing turns off

407
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
Any latency there

408
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
Quite honestly deadly

409
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,511
So either why it's important

410
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
This is YH

411
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Investing here

412
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
Now

413
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
The question is

414
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
What is an investor

415
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
Steak picado

416
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
Everyone makes season

417
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:12,543
3 years ago IBM was

418
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
Earlier this year

419
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,383
Microsoft was like we're investing 5 billion in it iot

420
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
Insulate PS4 billion at the edge

421
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
Does that mean

422
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,271
It's going to invest in R&D

423
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,831
And it's going to focus on business models

424
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Which would be

425
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,439
A lot of it's going to be security AI machine learning

426
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
And

427
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Again

428
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,559
Talked about this isn't highly specific

429
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,351
But it is worth mentioning

430
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,911
Cuz we're all cloud

431
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:45,055
And the four billion is going to be invested over the next 4 years so roughly a billion a year

432
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
So

433
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
Yay more money for

434
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
All right now

435
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
True that smart home

436
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Tp-link

437
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
Tp-link is adding

438
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Deco

439
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
Mesh routers

440
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,095
Along with

441
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,887
They're going to be able to have your router

442
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Aunt gift

443
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
So

444
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
Kevin

445
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
I love it

446
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
Because all these extra hubs boxes gateways Etc that were plugged into the router just never made

447
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:28,575
Sense to me just put the dawn radio chips for smartphones in the router to begin with and that's what they're doing

448
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:33,439
They had a this is there I think they're second mesh router The Deco M5 which is a dual-band

449
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,535
Router no other radios are the Wi-Fi maybe that Bluetooth

450
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,167
Now they got zigbee in a deco M9 plus mesh router to tribe instead of Dual Band

451
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
Yes more of this please

452
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
AR price

453
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
All right

454
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
Let's talk about

455
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Smart

456
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
Fridges

457
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
DRM specifically

458
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
Smart fridge

459
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,711
This is a

460
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,759
Twitter thread that I somehow got through

461
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
I'm really excited about

462
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,111
This fellow was complaining about

463
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
An RFID reader on

464
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
GE

465
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,767
Appliances so this RFID reader basically measures

466
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
If you have a

467
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
Branded

468
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,119
Water filter in your fridge

469
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
And if you don't

470
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
The water dispenser won't dispense

471
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Really

472
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Yes

473
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,871
It's not good for the lovely

474
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
It's red because it encompasses everything that you would have

475
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
In the sky being

476
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Doesn't work

477
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,671
We might hack it but most mainstream consumers know

478
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,999
Yes but it also includes GE Appliance

479
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,791
Weighing in to say

480
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
He's like hey

481
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,119
What is this and why are you doing this

482
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,959
Angie appliances says what this refrigerator requires this

483
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
Particular technology to work

484
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,055
Direct lease please see the following link for details

485
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
And then

486
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
She is like

487
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,175
The guys like this is unacceptable I don't like that and then

488
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
This guy

489
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
Geappliances says

490
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,063
Well we recommend only using geappliances RFID

491
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,135
Filters as they are designed for your refrigerator specifically

492
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,463
Usual a non-genuine filter

493
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,023
Guaranteed to work properly and may damage the area

494
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,351
This Is Not Unusual

495
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,399
Any company that sells branded

496
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
Toner filters

497
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
Whatever else that

498
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
Comes with his stuff

499
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
They're always going to say hey user

500
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Branded stuff

501
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
But

502
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,127
If we think back to Keurig in their pickups in

503
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
ERM associated

504
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
K-Cups

505
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
It becomes harder

506
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,503
When you connect a device to the

507
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,039
To do this

508
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
That's

509
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:41,439
Yeah me know I have a Samsung fridge and

510
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,839
Usually I buy the Samsung water filters but every once in a while either not available River and I'll get much cheaper

511
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,375
Third-party filter

512
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
I know it will work with my fridge

513
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,471
It will not work with this guy's French

514
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,775
He does not have that option and it's not

515
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,359
Disclose when you buy the fridge that it will only work

516
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,919
The persuaders DRM on the filters essentially

517
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,991
Yes and this is actually a really prevalent

518
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,807
Idea in the appliance industry

519
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
Because

520
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
They're looking for ways to

521
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
You know creep do services

522
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:17,535
Right so reminding you that your filters do and then being able to let you order One automatically

523
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
But

524
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,143
For the people who are like brother saves

525
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
This guy saying

526
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
$50

527
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,799
Reminder usually 40-ish

528
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
So yeah

529
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,919
Where is a third-party one might cost you the $15 or less

530
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,503
And in my case I actually have a water filtration system

531
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Full House

532
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,831
So I don't actually use the filter in my

533
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,159
But in that case GE does offer up iPad

534
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
So it just

535
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
If you put the bypass in

536
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,583
So your options here in this case are we

537
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
Return the fridge

538
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Buy the GE part

539
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,423
Orbit whole house water filtration system

540
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
I guess orange shoes

541
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,335
It looks like he is going to return it from the thread

542
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
Yes

543
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
This guy is like

544
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
I am returned

545
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,967
Interesting bit is talking about 2

546
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:11,807
Disclosure the filters typically last at least 3 to 6 months

547
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,879
Which when you figure this out when you run into this problem

548
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,928
It'd be well Pastor return.

549
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Yes

550
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:23,072
So we're going to say if you were making a smart Appliance

551
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
With your product in this

552
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
You got it exclusive

553
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,936
I feel like the FTC

554
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
And other organizations

555
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
What do you like

556
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
That's not cool

557
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,800
Sorry Green Revolution

558
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,152
Tigres

559
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
CRM

560
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
Mark Bridges

561
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
All right

562
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
Let's talk about other

563
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
Things that have gone wrong

564
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,344
Google is going to fix

565
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,624
Their location

566
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Google home

567
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,280
Yes it's a bit scary to me that this is

568
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:58,912
Just been found but krebsonsecurity reported about it

569
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,752
You can inject some JavaScript in a website if you are at

570
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:09,152
Evil person I guess and that script can run and find out if you have a go

571
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,688
Google home read Chromecast on

572
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
Your Wi-Fi network

573
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:18,368
And if you give it about a minute to run the script that is it can get super precise location.

574
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
Lake County Within

575
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
10 meters I believe

576
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,488
That's really bad

577
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:29,376
So Google is aware of it now and they are going to fix it I haven't seen when it's getting fixed but

578
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
Really really bad

579
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
Really really bad

580
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,336
I just I'm surprised I mean that home product is not brand new I mean you expect these kind of

581
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,152
Remember that

582
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
Incredible data

583
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
Consumption

584
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:54,720
Yeah that's fair to say I don't know if you wash it but there's about a minute-and-a-half video of somebody actually doing this

585
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
Script

586
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,280
The maid to actually exploited

587
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:01,632
And it like opens up a location in Google Maps to 239 close radar

588
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,032
Yeah it does take a minute like I'm staring at the screen like watching paint dry but you know that's not the point

589
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,896
What's less scary scary

590
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:19,296
Dependent be called bsh has partnered with techstars to develop accelerator program for the connected kitchen

591
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,832
If you are like me this is

592
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
Super exciting

593
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,648
TSH is 8

594
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,464
So one of the German iot

595
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
Countries that we talk

596
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,768
Satellites

597
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,608
Basically are going to create this accelerator with techstars

598
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,192
The focus is going to be on digital business models and

599
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
Analogies for the

600
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,544
Home so something that we are super interested in

601
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
And and super excited about

602
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
This will start

603
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,384
In Munich

604
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
In

605
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,688
2019

606
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,296
And it'll be a three-month accelerator program they've committed to finding it and making it happened

607
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
2021

608
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,624
Looking for 10 companies

609
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,928
So if you are excited about this

610
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,232
Keep an eye on techstars is website

611
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
And

612
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,560
I am sure you're going to see something about their partnership

613
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
Esh

614
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,144
Maybe I'll get my refrigerated

615
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
Crock pot

616
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
Biscottini

617
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Munich

618
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
Next year

619
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Go for it

620
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,616
But only picking 10 I mean

621
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,920
That's

622
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
Brilliant

623
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,760
Yes it is you're going to be one of the 10

624
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
You're welcome

625
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,112
Little tiny other things

626
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
Things to mention

627
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,928
One Google now has a podcast

628
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,256
And I know a lot of our audience listens to things

629
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,536
On the web or

630
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
Variety podcast

631
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,144
Less than half of you actually listen on iTune

632
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,496
So if you're one of those people who are listening on an Android phone

633
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
Or the Google home

634
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
Now you have a podcast

635
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
You can use

636
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,384
You do and even cooler I think

637
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,016
Is that when you listen to a podcast on your Google home you can posit

638
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:58,368
And in the podcast app on your phone you can say

639
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:02,720
Resume playing whatever the podcast is and it takes up with your phone left off

640
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
Well that's nice

641
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
Say when someone listens to it on the

642
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
That

643
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
Podcast

644
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
No

645
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
Yusuf Yusuf

646
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,056
Okay and we have to clarify

647
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Haitian

648
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,104
Last

649
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
All right

650
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
Buckle up

651
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
You guys

652
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,760
If you thought it was confusing last week prepare to be

653
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,344
In last week's episode we talked about 3

654
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,160
When talking about the nest connect

655
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
Device

656
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,000
And this is a device that acts as a bridge from your Wi-Fi network to

657
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
The other

658
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
Thread and

659
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,072
Bluetooth networks in the house

660
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,352
We said

661
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,424
Did it was thread ready and that it would run open

662
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,216
It is

663
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
Running open

664
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,032
Thread but it is also

665
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
Thread ready

666
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:49,824
Those are two separate

667
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,664
We also said Google Nest thread ready software was called

668
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,992
Open thread is actually an open-source thread

669
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
Group certified reference staff

670
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,600
That you used to build actual thread

671
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Supposed to

672
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,416
Thread ready devices

673
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,464
So the nest connect runs open

674
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
Thread but is actually still a threat Reddit

675
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Oh my gosh

676
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
Without asking

677
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,936
Yes that's all I can say yes

678
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
That help

679
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:22,080
I think part of the confusion I don't know if he said this last week or not is that

680
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,152
Some of these Hardware products came out while

681
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,944
The thread spec was kind of an

682
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Slight

683
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
And

684
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:33,344
It looks like there's transition in the works to following the truth.

685
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
If that makes sense

686
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,488

00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
How is

753
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
Speed

754
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,496
Versus

755
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,056
Just using the smartphone app

756
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
Or

757
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,848
Yap on the table

758
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,896
Just wanted to get your experience on that

759
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
Is the experience Key West

760
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,576
Compared to using Alexa and

761
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
Siri

762
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
Okay

763
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
This is

764
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,256
I'm sorry to disappoint you I have done some of these things but

765
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,328
I have used my Amazon

766
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
Echo Show

767
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,144
To see what is happening

768
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,960
For my Arlo cameras and to see what's happen

769
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:57,984
On my

770
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,776
Video doorbell which is by

771
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
August

772
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Not by

773
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
So

774
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,360
I can tell you

775
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,640
That there is

776
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,712
In my experience so far it is not faster

777
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,480
Everything going into

778
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,760
And

779
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
It's kind of a bummer

780
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,832
But it makes sense though

781
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:18,208
There's a technical reason why opening the app on your phone is going to be quicker

782
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,280
And that's because it's a lot quicker to just tap a nap and have

783
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:25,632
It opened immediately as opposed to speaking to a voice assistant where that

784
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,448
Recordings to go to the cloud has to come back

785
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
And then

786
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
The voice assistant

787
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,544
Toddler has to make the thing happen

788
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,896
So there's going to be at least I'm going to say one two three seconds minimum

789
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,736
So what difference early days when I first tried it out the August was like rough

790
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
Play seven seconds

791
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Shane

792
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,344
They felt like that are I'm not even to put that much debt are in the

793
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,416
But

794
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
It did get a little better

795
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,488
But it never got

796
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
To the same

797
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,096
That being said sometimes it's nice and

798
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,632
It's not going to catch the

799
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
Yes man right I used my Arlo on the

800
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,056
I actually put an Arlo camera on a roof deck and I would use it to check in on

801
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
The kids when they

802
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,872
Stuck so

803
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
I would just

804
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
Down in the kitchen I be

805
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,456
Show me the roof

806
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
And poof

807
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
I can see what was happy

808
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
I think so in that case

809
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
It didn't matter

810
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
It would be terrible in a

811
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,136
A Security Site

812
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,160
So

813
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:26,304
I'm glad can ask this though because I actually forgot that Madame a is built into my fire

814
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,704
10 HD tablet and I have actually turned her off on that because I'm almost always around a Madam a device

815
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,288
But the advantage of the tablet is it has a screen

816
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,824
And I never thought to

817
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,152
Try and really use it in that way kind of like a show or a spot

818
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:46,784
So thank you for that kind I will probably turn her back on and do some testing now as a result of this

819
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
Correct

820
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
So

821
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,672
And I don't have Siri

822
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,720
On anything that's connected to anything

823
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
That Siri

824
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
Control cell

825
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,072
I don't know and for what it's worth I do have

826
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,912
Google Assistant built into my TV set-top box

827
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:08,800
In my office which is connected to a big 4K TV and I do use that to say hey

828
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,592
G show me the

829
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,384
Front window where I have a nest camera

830
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,200
It does work but again you got that latency

831
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:21,088
Tilted my point is this is not unique to Amazon this is the way this is all architected for all of them

832
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
Remember

833
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,184
If you would like to be entered

Smart deadbolt which I have tried and is really good

837
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,328
Plus a Wi-Fi adapter

Family members

847
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,480
Read the fine print

848
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
All right

849
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
That is it

850
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
New segment

Leak detection

855
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,072
So we're spending a lot of time talking about insurance

856
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
How

857
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120

The Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

880
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:16,032
Gabe halimi who is the co-founder and CEO of flow technology

881
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,056
I gave thanks

882
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,848
You're coming hey Stacy thanks for having me

883
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,200
Several months ago I wrote about

884
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,504
Bunch of startups that are disrupting

885
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
Leak Detection space

886
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,600
Inflow is one of those startups

887
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,880
So it really fast

888
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:31,904
Telus

889
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
What flow does

890
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:37,280
Yes flow is a water monitoring and shut off technology

891
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
G for the home

892
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
One device

893
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
Install Azan

894
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
The main water supply line

895
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:45,472
Proactively monitors the Integrity of the whole plumbing system to prevent

896
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,008
Catastrophic water damage

897
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,824
From happening at all we learned habits of the home

898
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,872
And we detect things that lead to leak

899
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:55,456
Slight high pressure thermal expansion freezing pipes

900
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,760
And by monitoring for those things

901
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,088
We can alert the homeowner and if something catastrophic happens

902
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,928
Can automatically shut off the water thereby preventing claims

903
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,024
So you do catastrophic like oh my gosh my pipe has burst it's crazy

904
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
Do you also do things

905
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,632
Absolutely so our technology

906
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,912
It detects something this

907
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
Small as a drop of water a day

908
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,008
Allison mosto Leak Detection falls into

909
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
A couple of different cat

910
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,336
You either have technologies that

911
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,920
Do not install on the main water supply line or ones that do

912
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:32,320
So like you just covered my friends at Roost and notion I would put those in the category of like the point sensor cattle

913
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,856
They're not on the main line

914
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:38,464
Many of other technologies that install on the mainline those generally can catch League

915
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,024
You know anywhere in the home like ours can

916
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,328
I think our technology is very unique

917
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
And that

918
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
We also have pressure sensor

919
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,936
Capability which is allows us

920
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:50,240
To catch things like micro leaks

921
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
So by doing pressure test

922
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,056
Yes we can identify

923
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:59,456
Leaks that are tiny behind the wall underneath the slab of the home that generally cannot be found by just

924
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
Monitoring the flow

925
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,040
Another category

926
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,344
Which is those that turn the water off

927
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
And those that

928
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,672
And you guys actually will

929
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
Turn the water off

930
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
Absolute

931
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,048
You're right those are the two different ways that we kind of breakouts at

932
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Competitive land

933
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,840
Landscape now there is

934
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,888
A lot of questions around pricing

935
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,424
Installation art technology

936
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
Does required

937
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,472
Professional insulation

938
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,264
Technology

939
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,848
Do not but I think what you get for that in the end of the day is

940
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
A technology that

941
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,176
And really help prevent water damage

942
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,224
From happening in the first place which I think is really any

943
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:39,392
And I'll just toss out some of those competitors so you don't have to say their names

944
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,184
Falcon

945
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
Flume

946
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
And some others

947
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,816
Lots of options out there and leave

948
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
Super hot police tube

949
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
Be right now

950
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
Why

951
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,192
First of all

952
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,216
When you look at it

953
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:56,032
Homeowners insurance claims that happen every year

954
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
Water dam

955
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,872
As a result of Plumbing failures is the leading

956
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
Things every year

957
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,784
More than five times likely they'll have a water damage claim versus

958
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
Or fire

959
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,112
And that's usually where people mine

960
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:16,512
When they think of homeowners insurance and what they're trying to protect against it's about 9 billion dollars every year

961
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,816
Worth of losses for the insurance

962
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,632
Industry and it's five times more likely

963
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,936
That you'll have water damage in your home

964
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,984
Then a fire claim

965
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,264
Or a ceph

966
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,568
So by frequency it is

967
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,592
Deleting cars

968
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
Claims about 25

969
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,408
Percent of all homeowners

970
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
Insurance claim

971
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:39,808
And so even though people's minds homeowners Minds frequently go to you know fire theft

972
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:44,928
There's really a lot of human Peril involves are the insurance industry it definitely has a

973
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,976
The focus on the water damage claim

974
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,536
And it is preventable

975
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,304
I mean you can

976
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,840
Really prevent a hurricane

977
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,632
Through it a neighborhood

978
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,936
But seems like fire things like that

979
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,984
Things like Plumbing failures

980
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,544
These are things that can be prevented with the right

981
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,568
Two technologies

982
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:06,176
We've been working on this for about 10 years my father is my co-founder and

983
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
Inventor and

984
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,528
She has been a mechanical engineer for years

985
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:14,368
For the plumbing industry he was a manufacturer but really notable

986
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,184
Here was that he was actually an expert witness

987
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
Miss for the plumbing industry

988
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,000
Defending

989
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,024
Subrogation claim

990
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
Games from insurance

991
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
Plumbing failure would happen

992
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:28,448
Put in a home maybe a water connector pops off of the main water supply line

993
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,032
An insurance company would maybe payout that claim and then turn around

994
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,824
Send file a subrogation claim against

995
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,920
Plumbing manufacturer who they think may be responsible maybe a legend

996
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,712
Product liability or negligence

997
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,528
And my father had defended over a thousand

998
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,344
None of those claims he was seeing these astronomical

999
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,112
Client app

1000
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,696
And here he is the Forefront of Plumbing innovation

1001
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,232
He said previous and bench

1002
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:57,632
Sensitive sold over 18 million units and he's seeing these crazy claims happening as a result of Plumbing

1003
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,680
Failures and he decided that they're needed

1004
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
To be a better way

1005
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
So this gets us

1006
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,264
Send to one of my favorite topics

1007
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,544
Switches insurance

1008
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,568
Because

1009
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:09,152
Gosh it feels like these guys should have a vested interest

1010
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,200
I'm putting this kind of product

1011
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,736
In the market and getting it into

1012
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,760
The consumer's hands

1013
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,808
What are you actually finding

1014
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
When it's released

1015
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,904
I think that although

1016
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,928
Most insurance

1017
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,976
Sweet talk to you I mean every insurance

1018
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,280
We talked to understand the value prop

1019
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,584
They understand what it is we're doing

1020
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,888
They're very intrigued we are also

1021
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:36,288
Similar to our friends in a roost and notion were working with a number of different insurance companies on pilot

1022
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:41,664
But because the technology is expensive and because it needs to be you know professionally installed

1023
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,688
We believe the

1024
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:46,272
Why is there and it'll pay for itself to adopt

1025
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,808
And we found ourselves

1026
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,112
In what seemed like an endless

1027
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,160
Cycle of the pilot test

1028
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,952
And so we decided was

1029
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,744
We were going to collect our own data

1030
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,536
And we were going to get ourselves comfort

1031
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:01,120
Trouble with our ability to actually help prevent claims

1032
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Susan Drive down

1033
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
The frequency and severity

1034
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
And

1035
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,496
Come out with our own guarantee

1036
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
To homeowners

1037
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,080
Is that if they adopt our technology

1038
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,640
And if they act reasonably by

1039
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,200
You know taking care of their alerts when they happen

1040
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:20,832
And maintaining their home with the tips we give them that we will guarantee that they will not have catastrophic water damage

1041
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Pitch in their home

1042
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,136
We just took

1043
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,672
An approach that work I know

1044
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,720
Insurance companies agnostic

1045
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,536
If you will until the insurance company comes around

1046
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,608
And does ketchup and I believe that they will

1047
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
Eventually

1048
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,216
But in the meantime our value proposition kind of stands for itself

1049
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,056
The doorbell company

1050
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,336
And now owned by Amazon

1051
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,152
Offered a deductible reimbursement process for their stuff

1052
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
Tattoo they did and

1053
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,712
Jamie siminoff

1054
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,016
From ring was actually one of my First Investors

1055
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:54,624
In my company and he was one of my early adviser so that was definitely a play out of there

1056
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,160
Play book I saw Jamie.

1057
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,976
Doing that a long time ago and kind of scratch my head and I was like

1058
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:05,376
That's something that we may be able to do once we collect more data and feel really comfortable now Jamie did that with an insurance

1059
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
He did that with

1060
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,704
American Family Insurance I believe

1061
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,520
And so we got so confident

1062
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,312
And you know we were kind of

1063
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:19,712
Working with different partners and we just decided hey this is something that we can potentially do ourselves looked at the data that we have been

1064
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
Collecting from

1065
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:26,880
The many homes that we've installed our technology in and just made the decision internally that this was something that we were just going to go up

1066
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
About doing ourselves

1067
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,440
So from an Actuarial basis

1068
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
Does Ensure is love

1069
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,768
Do you have to have a certain number of like

1070
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,048
It's like man years but they're just year

1071
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,584
Years of data on

1072
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
How do you guys

1073
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:44,544
Create models what are confidence intervals what is this look like when you're like setting aside money in escrow

1074
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,568
To pay this out

1075
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,152
I mean truthfully with the homes that we've been installed with so far

1076
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,200
We haven't seen any catastrophic water

1077
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:56,576
Anyone that follows our technology the way that it should be kind of did the math to see how many homes

1078
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,112
We would have had to pay out claims

1079
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,160
4 so far if every single person

1080
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,744
It's signed up for home protect program and we just we didn't have any claim

1081
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
So to some extent is a

1082
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
The startup you know you can just

1083
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:09,376
Look at the data you have I wouldn't say that any of the data that we

1084
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,192
Collected would get any of the big insurance companies

1085
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:18,592
Comfortable we've been operating as a company for new three years and had a about a product on the market for less than

1086
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,128
One so I don't think there is

1087
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,176
Any way that we could get an insurance company

1088
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:27,296
But that's kind of the way that we went about it that's why we went about it the way that we did

1089
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,624
Let's talk about this from

1090
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,024
Perspective only because they care so much about longevity and this is the sort of product where I plan to install this

1091
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,304
How often should I

1092
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,608
Replace this or think about how often should I have to

1093
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,680
The part of our technology that can

1094
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,728
Really suffer from wear and tear

1095
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:52,128
Is the mechanical ball valve or technology does turn on and turn off the water every single day that's how

1096
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,783
Test every day whether or not there's a leak in the home we know definitively whether or not there are leaks every single day

1097
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,087
Turning on and turning off the water

1098
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
And actually eating that ball Bell

1099
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
.

1100
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
Mechanical part could wear

1101
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:09,279
Parent are so we've tested that for well over five years we've actually tested it over 8

1102
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,583
We believe that once you install this

1103
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,911
You really don't need to think about it for at least five years that's a week

1104
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,471
I think the useful life is but it could be much longer

1105
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,007
Any device

1106
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
Nest isn't

1107
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,311
Reduce the number of different

1108
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:26,943
You know thermostats ring has introduced new doorbells that technology just gets better and better with time

1109
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,967
So I don't believe that this

1110
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:32,831
This is the kind of product that you just going to want to let you know set it and forget it for the next 50 years I believe that

1111
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,391
Some point people will probably want to upgrade anyways

1112
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:39,743
Okay so for a while nest on the thermostat front was doing upgrades like

1113
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,767
Every 12 to 8

1114
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
18 months which belt

1115
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,327
Like super fast

1116
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:49,727
Granted it was a brand new product so I doubt it but what do you think the logical product update cycle is for something

1117
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,263
That is smart

1118
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:57,919
It's closer to about like 24 to 36 months I just believe I think that in our space

1119
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
They specifically this is

1120
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,015
This is so new and there's so much that we can do around water

1121
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,063
That I'm going to come tell you you're going to c-diff

1122
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,343
Different versions of our product

1123
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,903
Released within the next 24 to 36 months

1124
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:14,047
For sure and I think that you know we're all kind of waiting as you've touched on in your previous articles for some

1125
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,631
Great connected home platform to kind of bring all these products

1126
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,447
Together I think with all the data that were collecting

1127
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,239
We're only going to make the home

1128
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,031
Smarter from our standpoint

1129
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:27,871
Specifically I can tell you like we're collecting data every second of the day

1130
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,943
From a water flow standpoint pressure stamp

1131
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,783
Temperature I mean this is all new data that no one is really

1132
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:39,135
You know using yet to make the home more thoughtful and so as differ

1133
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,671
Protocols May

1134
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,999
Come to the Forefront and whatnot I think for a number of reasons

1135
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,303
Maybe 24 to 36 months

1136
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,839
Okay

1137
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
Insurance

1138
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,423
It's cuz I didn't quite as much as I wanted to there

1139
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
Let's talk

1140
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,239
Priestly so you guys have started this

1141
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:57,823
I agree that the insurance Market is waiting on data that

1142
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,895
I don't know if they'll ever get what do you think

1143
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,687
They're going to do in the smart

1144
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,991
Cuz there's this idea that they're going to

1145
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,039
Remake the way they offer

1146
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Policies

1147
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,623
Premiums but then there's also a much more

1148
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,951
Have Monday and idea that they'll just do it as a competitive differentiator like

1149
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,767
In marketing their insurance products which is maybe less exciting

1150
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,815
Yeah and I think the ladder is what they've

1151
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,863
I've been doing today all the big

1152
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,935
Partnerships that we've seen between iot products

1153
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
Can insurance

1154
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,239
I've really been about Mark

1155
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
It's really been about

1156
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,543
The differentiating

1157
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
Their product

1158
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,847
@the insurtech conference

1159
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,895
In October of last year

1160
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,663
I had the

1161
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,223
Share some thoughts on stage

1162
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,783
And one of the things I said to insurance companies is

1163
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,319
I want a partner with insurance

1164
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,367
Companies that actually want

1165
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,391
To drive down

1166
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,439
Claim frequency and severity

1167
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
That's what we're doing

1168
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,511
People want to

1169
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,583
Introduce Flo is a marketing product they can do that

1170
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,911
But really we really want to make an impact on insurance

1171
00:44:55,423 --> 00:45:00,543
Really want to make an impact on how often homeowners are being inconvenienced by water damage

1172
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,079
So far there's a lot of

1173
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,127
Talk and I think that you are seeing

1174
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,151
Startup insurance

1175
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:11,807
Are seeing the opportunity and are moving you know very quickly to adopt iot and really big That Into You Know.

1176
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,623
The way that they are offering Insurance in the way that they're

1177
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,159
Apple protecting home so

1178
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,183
If they don't

1179
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,975
To get it together that's right

1180
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,767
The disruption

1181
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,791
Is really going to happen

1182
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,583
I will say Stacy there was one

1183
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,863
Gaia can't name is

1184
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:31,263
Name cuz we were under Andy and I can't even name the insurance company but there was one executive from one of the top five insurance

1185
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,079
They said said to me you know what some point the insurance

1186
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,615
Industry just needs

1187
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,151
Look at each other

1188
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,431
And say hey

1189
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,223
This is a great thing

1190
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,015
You know we can test this

1191
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:42,783
And I mean

1192
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
Are products

1193
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,343
She's probably been tested by most

1194
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,391
Insurance companies in there

1195
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,159
Employee homes

1196
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,439
And I know that they're just

1197
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,487
They're all their eyes light up when they

1198
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:58,143
You know in real-time they can see what's happening with their homes water it'll shut off the water for them automatically

1199
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,447
So at some point the executives

1200
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,775
You know on the business side need to go back to the x-rays and just say hey

1201
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
We don't

1202
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
Need

1203
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,335
50000

1204
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,127
Years worth of data

1205
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:13,759
Like this is just a great thing and it's logical that this is going to help drive down claim and we have to

1206
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
To do something

1207
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,855
And so what he believes was going to happen

1208
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,927
Is that at some point you're just going to get

1209
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:27,071
A bunch of people together in a company that just said this is too good to pass up we need to do something aggressive here

1210
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,863
And I kind of share that thought with

1211
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,399
I don't know if that act

1212
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,167
Actuarial

1213
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,215
50000 years of data is

1214
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,751
Is going to happen before

1215
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:41,151
You just got a few people that are thinking logically that are just willing to put their neck on the line and say this is something we have to adopt

1216
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,943
That's more likely to happen first

1217
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:48,575
And if they don't it feels like they risk being cut out and there's a lot of opportunities

1218
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:52,927
According to McKinsey

1219
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:56,255
The insurance company like Google or Amazon

1220
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,327
And create an insurance product

1221
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,423
Corporates connected devices that would be a much better deal

1222
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,215
For consumers because they would have

1223
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
Again

1224
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,287
Products like yours as part of that portfolio

1225
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,055
Unclaimed sky

1226
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
Process

1227
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,847
Policy pricing

1228
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,151
Do you think that's feasible

1229
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,431
Absolutely

1230
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,735
I think that not only are we going to

1231
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,783
See those kind of companies

1232
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
Adopt

1233
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,367
The right Technologies in the more aggressive way

1234
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,903
They're going to know what to do with all the

1235
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,695
Data link right now

1236
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,743
Even you know I have a nest in my house

1237
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,767
I have

1238
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,047
Ring doorbell I have

1239
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,327
My flow device

1240
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:37,727
And none of them are really talking to each other at least in a very smart way that's helping to

1241
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,287
Protect my home and giving me multiples

1242
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,311
On that invest

1243
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,591
With my device

1244
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,127
With the flow device

1245
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,151
Installed in a home

1246
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:50,527
Like I said before we're collecting data every second of the day and so we know when

1247
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,319
People are home and not home

1248
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,855
Just based on their water

1249
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,183
So at some point you're going to see

1250
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,463
When the flow device

1251
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,255
Shows that there's been no water use

1252
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:05,119
DiGiorno flushes of a toilet for example for 24 hours but the alarm has

1253
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,167
You should get a ping

1254
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:12,799
You should probably set your alarm it doesn't look like you're home because you haven't had any water running here

1255
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:16,895
Once you are able to connect all of these different devices

1256
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,455
You're going to get a home that's much more resilient

1257
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,991
Much smarter

1258
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,295
And I think that the way that it's looking

1259
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:28,415
It's much more likely than Amazon or Google is going to come in and do that rather than

1260
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,439
And insurance

1261
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:36,095
Do you think customers and consumers are going to be excited about sharing all that data providers

1262
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,631
I think it's all about

1263
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,655
What's a quid pro quo

1264
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,935
I think that

1265
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:43,519
Data can be used as a currency so today we don't

1266
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,799
Volunteer

1267
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,079
Homeowners data

1268
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,359
To share with

1269
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
Insurance Company

1270
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
However

1271
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,967
If a homeowner would like to get some kind of an

1272
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,247
Incentive from their care

1273
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,039
And their carrier will offer that in

1274
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,319
Incentive in exchange

1275
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:00,927
Or some sharing of data then that's a decision that the homeowner

1276
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,719
Should be able to make on their own

1277
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,767
If they don't want to share the data then

1278
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:09,119
You know they don't have to accept whatever the insurance company is offering

1279
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:15,519
So I think that it's a decision that homeowners have to make I think it's an option for them ultimately I do think they will

1280
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:20,639
Will share their data as long as it's used in a responsible way it will make their premium

1281
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,175
Lower not just because of

1282
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,223
The incentive that they're getting from

1283
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:30,111
The insurance carrier for the adoption But ultimately when you bring all of these different data points together

1284
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,951
It's just going to make the home smarter and better able to protect you

1285
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:38,047
Which will ultimately mean lower premium so I really do believe that it's in everybody's best

1286
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,607
Pinterest you mentioned earlier some of the

1287
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,911
Cool things that we can do with water in

1288
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,447
So I'm curious

1289
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,591
So when you can just learn a lot about

1290
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
Homeowners

1291
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,663
You can learn a lot about how they interact

1292
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,711
With their home one of the things that I've been

1293
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,247
Discussing with insurance

1294
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,319
Carriers and the light bulb goes off they get it is

1295
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,343
When you

1296
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,623
Receiving alert

1297
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:05,439
From Flo that for example you have high

1298
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
Water pressure

1299
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:13,375
High water pressure essentially is like high blood pressure in your body if you have high blood pressure for long periods of time

1300
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
That's putting under

1301
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,727
The Strain on your veins or arteries eventually organs.

1302
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,543
When you have high water pressure in

1303
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
On your pipes that me

1304
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
Means that you're putting

1305
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,871
Do strain on your pipes

1306
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:29,247
Your fixtures your appliances and eventually something will burst this is part of the preventive side of our technology

1307
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,039
So when you have this data

1308
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
And you have these

1309
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,599
Set alerts from Flo they're telling you

1310
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:40,255
Hey you got high water pressure this is a maintenance opportunity you got to do something about it and I'll let say that the homeowner ignores those

1311
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,303
They throw caution to the wind

1312
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,583
No they don't do anything

1313
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,631
Now I think that says something

1314
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,399
About

1315
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,447
Potentially that homo

1316
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,775
Is that the same kind of homeowner that leaves their doors unlock

1317
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,823
Doesn't set their alarm

1318
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,359
Smell gas and doesn't do any

1319
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,663
I think there's a lot that in

1320
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,431
Insurance

1321
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,479
Learn about customer

1322
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,759
Behavior and I don't

1323
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:06,623
Mean to suggest that you know homeowner should be scared of data I think what this is doing is

1324
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,903
It's offering more

1325
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,183
Opportunities

1326
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,463
For homeowners

1327
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,231
To see what happen

1328
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,511
Behind the black box

1329
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,047
That is their Plumbing

1330
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,071
Behind all these different

1331
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,887
I think the key to a smart home is

1332
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,911
Having a home that's

1333
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,447
More thoughtful that suggest

1334
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:24,543
To you when there are different problems lurking when you need to act

1335
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:29,151
And not just you know being able to open and close your door by pushing a button

1336
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:32,223
I think it's really about having a home that's smarter that better put

1337
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,527
XU so that's one of the things that I'm

1338
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,551
Suggesting about

1339
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,367
Water data I think it's a great indicator of

1340
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,159
Not only occupancy

1341
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:43,231
But it's a great lens into all of the different Acts

1342
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:48,095
Cavities in the home and being able to better protect you from a number of different dimensions

1343
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,375
Awesome

1344
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:53,471
Because sometimes I am

1345
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,567
I am curious to see this Brave New World

1346
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,127
