We have got an

8
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
Excellent chauffeur

9
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,600
So much goodness

10
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,160
May bridge homekit and

11
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,464
The other protocols

12
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,816
We got a bunch of Google related stuff with pixel in Android watches we got

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,352
Security

14
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,888
Sabeco data

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,216
And a bunch of Mobile World Congress news about net

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,032
Some of you guys may not care about but

17
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,592
You should you do what you do Stacy

18
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,128
About it

19
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,688
Tim Cook uses homekit

20
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,736
Because it's always good to get those kind

21
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,016
Opinions

22
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:58,624
And I'm finally finally going to talk about my experiment in double Network

23
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:03,232
We're going to do all of this time we're gonna have a word from our sponsor spin dance

24
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,536
And then we're going to have Jenny

25
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,632
Who is the head of techstars iot incubator talking about

26
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,424
What is trendy

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,728
Right now for startups in the internet

28
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
Now

29
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,288
Before we get to all of that

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,944
Let's have a word from another one of our sponsors this week sponsor is a Lynette

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
Kayla is an Enterprise internet-of-things platform that is empowering the world's leading manufacturers by simple

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,744
Find the inherent complexity of the internet of things in their products into smart connected systems

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,144
Transform their businesses to compete in the game changing world is coming tippity

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,544
Complexity of developing connected products and is trusted by some of the leading brand so they can focus on what they do best

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,640
Kayla is solving the internet of things so you don't have to

36
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,176
To download the whitepaper

37
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,576
Biggest mistakes manufacturers make when launching iot products at Stacey on iot

38
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
.com

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,696
Paper cuz I'm very curious what those massage

40
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464
State Farm

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
Alright Kevin

42
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
Let's get started

43
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Let's start with

44
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,216
Yes and that's which has a range of products or products they have improved the notifications on their nest cam

45
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,104
It can now identify a door for example and turn it into like a a Zone

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,456
For monitoring so that way if it's

47
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
And you said yes it is

48
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,528
They can actually monitor

49
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
Activity through that

50
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,160
And that will help you understand who's coming and going in your house

51
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,304
So you could always manually trolleys activity zones but now that Nest is smart enough to actually kind of figure out

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,400
What is ask you is this an activity Zone you might want to look at us

53
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
Additionally

54
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,520
The alerts on the nest protect are better because

55
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,128
If your smoke alarm senses smoke or carbon monoxide

56
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:01,760
You automatically get live video from all the nest Cam that you have in your house which is kind of cool I think it was like

57
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,064
Is this a false alarm

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Is problem right now

59
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
You can tell you that right away so

60
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:12,000
Can I see Improvement and there's no additional cost for this kind of Nest does charge for

61
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
You know saving recordings in the cloud

62
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,632
Tanner 30 days at a time but this is all just built in in the

63
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,680
And available with the new update

64
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
Actually that might be good for

65
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,520
Fireman when they come to the house

66
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
It is

67
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
Burning town

68
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,896
They can actually get a visual inside the house before the cameras belt

69
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,224
And since it's all stored in the cloud Maybe

70
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
You know if there's a

71
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
Investigation after

72
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Data from

73
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
Those cameras

74
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
I don't know yet

75
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
And I think if you would have been

76
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,512
Every home should have like an emergency plan to evacuate

77
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,120
If you can quickly pinpoint what area of the house is the problem area you need to get out

78
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,728
That may impact or help you get out quicker because you'll need to go that way so it's B

79
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Yeah yeah

80
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
A few seconds

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
We should say the nest is owned by Google

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,784
Is not owned by Google but he does work for Google as a contractor but I don't work with the nest people around

83
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,088
Any other smart home initiatives at Google

84
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Okay

85
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
Dimension

86
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
Thread

87
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,744
Recorded the podcast

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,047
Thread actually announced today that they have

89
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
Thread certified chips out

90
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
And the big news for the week are about

91
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
How is that

92
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,543
New thread devices will launch before the end of this year

93
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
In fact

94
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
I talked to somebody and

95
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,223
They told me that a new thread based device the first one will launch in May

96
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
I don't know

97
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
Well that actually jives with

98
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:47,231
Threadgill's kind of buried in their press release it says certified thread based products are expected enter the market in the first half of the

99
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Urso

100
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,559
There could be more than just one in May

101
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
There we go

102
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
Looking forward

103
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
I actually am

104
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,263
We were talking about third for a couple of years and it just

105
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
Whiskey talkin about it but

106
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,615
We're not seeing a ton of actual progress

107
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
It was a

108
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
Rin

109
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,527
Protocol so true true they launched in 2014

110
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
Shred that work

111
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,623
Build this and so that actually me

112
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
Makes sense

113
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
It does take time

114
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
Cuz it's right

115
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
All right

116
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
So some other really

117
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
I don't know

118
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
This is this is cool that this could be

119
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
Where I want to give you guys

120
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,287
But it's CSI miss this and someone pointed it out to

121
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Which

122
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
For 4

123
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,639
There's a pub called The Mix tile

124
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,687
Made by a Chinese company

125
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
Falcon Crest

126
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,831
And this device. We don't have pricing we don't know what it's going to be out

127
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
The cool thing about it though is

128
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Hug that could

129
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
Tire home

130
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
It's tough to your Z-Wave and zigbee

131
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,559
Cuz it Doesn't it's apparently mfi certified

132
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,655
So I don't know what to say here other than I am

133
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
It comes out so I

134
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,287
It sounds cool like we said we don't know which

135
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591
It's actually going to launch win cost and all that

136
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,895
So if I'm understanding it

137
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
Frankly this is a way to get

138
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
Essentially some non homekit

139
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,807
Devices working with homekit and the home app in your Apple

140
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
IPhone ER

141
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
Wear your iPad

142
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,975
Does that sound right because I'm going to be nice to Adnan homekit tanks

143
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,071
So it's either going to have its own app where you would actually then have to work at

144
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
Everything but I'm hoping it brings the stuff

145
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
IOS

146
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,751
Yeah that's that's what I'm thinking is it supposed to do

147
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
Which is good

148
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
You've got the security

149
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
Chip inside

150
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,431
It's hard to mix tile because it's mfi certified

151
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:47,295
And then hopefully that would handle any situation shoes from the non homekit devices

152
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
Yeah

153
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
I will say it's nice to have that option

154
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
Although what you're going to end up

155
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
We will see

156
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,471
It was worth every one noting

157
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
Will keep up on this

158
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
Moving away from home kit

159
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
Let's talk about

160
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Google

161
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
Hanson's Kevin's already given his

162
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
My disclaimer

163
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,855
When is you can actually control Smart Home devices

164
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
Pixel

165
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
You have

166
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,463
Yeah so this kind of brings

167
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
Google home

168
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
Capabilities

169
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,327
2 in a limited degree to a

170
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,911
Google pixel or pixel XL phone through Google Assistant

171
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,983
And it sort of makes sense cuz Google assistant is really the

172
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
The brains

173
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
Inside

174
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
Google home

175
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
I haven't seen any official announcements on this

176
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,943
So I didn't say anything originally when I first

177
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
Read about this last week

178
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,551
People all over our reporting it and also

179
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
I see the setting in my

180
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
On my pixel

181
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,439
If you have a pixel or pixel XL and go into your

182
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
Google Now settings

183
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,047
You should see a smart home

184
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
Teacher or devices future

185
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,143
Where you can add support for

186
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
WeMo

187
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,471
SmartThings and Philips Hue

188
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,799
And that will add voice control through your pixel 2 those

189
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
Those devices github

190
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
So I don't have

191
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,455
Hue setup I don't have smart thing so I went wink

192
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015
But I do have some WeMo switches so course I tried it

193
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:28,415
And it works just like it works with my echo you know I just am not going to say the hot word but I just say the hot word so that the phone is listening

194
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:33,023
Can I say turn office on my office lights

195
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
There's really no

196
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
Lag

197
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,887
Or anything like that but then again that

198
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:44,287
Particular setup I have with the WeMo is a direct Wi-Fi connection so it should be quick there's no Cloud involved but actually there is cloud

199
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,591
Because the phone is going to I presume

200
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,639
Send that to Google servers

201
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
No there's no cloud

202
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
Yeah I think

203
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:01,695
I think it's I think it's straight in the case of the WeMo I think it is a straight connection over Wi-Fi because you link your wink not you

204
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,023
Either way it works fast

205
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
The shoe would be cloudy

206
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
And so

207
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
Exactly

208
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
McDonald's

209
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,031
And so you know when you go look for this you're going to go to settings on your Google assistant and

210
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
The title is called

211
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,663
I know so many different words for

212
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
And

213
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
So

214
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
You may be

215
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,111
Questioning why you want your phone to do this I personally

216
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
I think it's awesome

217
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
Not in the room

218
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Device perhaps

219
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,999
But if you want to do this with the Amazon Echo

220
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,023
There's actually a way you

221
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
I can do that without the ra

222
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Amazon doesn't ask

223
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,911
There is an app called me app

224
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
Download

225
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
And basically

226
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
You open the app

227
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
You press the button in

228
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
Can you tell

229
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,103
She Who Shall Not Be Named to do something and low and behold

230
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,919
That's pretty cool cuz it also works when you

231
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,991
And I still think it should be part of the

232
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,039
Official Amazon native app but that's just me

233
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,439
And I'm not trying to

234
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,023
Put the people at a business by any means I love what they did but

235
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
Really it should be native

236
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
All right

237
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
Let's talk about

238
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
Smart watches

239
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Kevin

240
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
It's terrible

241
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
I'm on my second cup of coffee is okay

242
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,079
Cuz I saw the Android watches

243
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
The task

244
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Best casino

245
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
Gotcha so

246
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:33,855
So officially Android Wear 2.0 that's Google's platform for smart watches came out of developer

247
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,903
Preview it is available for

248
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
Device makers to use and so on

249
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,791
LG actually has two watches out already

250
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,887
They are available online and in some stores and a carriers

251
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
I just tell you that

252
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
Between the two there's a big difference

253
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
Some the LG watch Style

254
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
$49

255
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
It is thin ish

256
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
It's thinner than the second one I'll say that

257
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,967
But it is missing a lot of features from the second watch

258
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
So there's no

259
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,855
LTE dedicated LTE connection which The Logical don't really need anything

260
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,903
There's no NFC so

261
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,719
We can't do Android pay with it there's no

262
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,767
Or somewhere new GPS in it so

263
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:19,167
So it's not for me somebody who runs everyday and wears a sport watch outside this is not for me it does have Google Assistant

264
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
Raise your wrist and you can

265
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
You know just ask a question and

266
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:27,615
Presume that you should be able to control the things that we just have out with a pixel

267
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
Through the watch that way

268
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
I presume I don't know cuz I don't have one of these

269
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:37,599
The LG watch sport is $349 to a hundred bucks more and get you a dedicated LTE connection

270
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,439
There's actually a nano SIM slot inside the watch

271
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
The watch comes with a

272
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
A special wrench

273
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:48,863
That you take the back of the watch off with and popping a SIM cards crazy senior phone calls

274
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,959
You have a data connection you can stream whatever music and so on as long as Internet for it

275
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,007
So that's kind of interesting that could be

276
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Used

277
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,359
How to control a home when you're out and about running maybe you

278
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,919
Need to open up the garage door for somebody for example

279
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
Right

280
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,247
Oh I was going to say or you want to set your AC down

281
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
I said when you get

282
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
When you get back here like

283
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:14,719
And then again I don't know that you can actually do that but the capability certainly there I don't see why you wouldn't be able to do that

284
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,023
Maybe in the future if not now but sub

285
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:22,143
But the LG watch sport is very thick in about 15 15 1/2 millimeters thick

286
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Clunky and big

287
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,007
You know it's got every kind of sensor

288
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,567
Feature you would want in a smartwatch

289
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,431
And I can't think of anything that would be missing in terms of up sensors and so on so

290
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,503
That one is available through AT&T and Verizon

291
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
Either on or off contract but

292
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,623
We all know that friends don't let friends buy devices on contracts

293
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,999
That it's five or $10 to add that LTE connection to your account as well so

294
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:52,607
But yeah this could be a handy way to do some remote control type things

295
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,655
Yeah well I would like it just to

296
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
Listen to

297
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
Music without hearing my

298
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Roundabout

299
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,055
I do that now with

300
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,615
My old Android Wear watches as well as my Apple watch

301
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
Because you can

302
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,199
Store almost 4 gig of Music there

303
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,247
Are you used to say when I stream music

304
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
No I could actually

305
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Restore it like

306
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,671
I see Spotify is is kind of an outlier in that

307
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,207
Yasso

308
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:24,095
With apple music and Google play music you can download to your various watches depending on your platform

309
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
And like I

310
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:30,239
Cute mine up with like three hours of music so I can easily go run a half marathon

311
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
And I I just

312
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
Carry my music with me that way

313
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
Easily run a half

314
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:45,087
It's not easy but I could you know fall down a bunch of times and still cross the finish line and still have

315
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
Music list to listen to

316
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
I don't advise that

317
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Hope you like heaven

318
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
Chow dog

319
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,143
One is bad enough we don't need more of me

320
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
The Mirai botnet

321
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,543
But you probably remember because we talked about it at

322
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
10 * 5

323
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
Late last year

324
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,151
This is a ran on

325
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
Connected

326
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Linux

327
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,223
Devices so

328
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,063
Network DVR players were big culprits couple routers

329
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
And what it is

330
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
It was part of the big DDOS attack

331
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Against

332
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,255
Adena systems and took down

333
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,535
Major websites around

334
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Very exciting

335
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
Mariah still out

336
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Someone has

337
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Where did it

338
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
Windows machine

339
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,847
Oh thank you ever do that sarcasm

340
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
What this means basically is

341
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,527
I don't know how often you going to like your doctor's office or maybe a point-of-sale turn

342
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
UCD

343
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:52,671
He Windows prompts but that means all of those machines could now become compromised and

344
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,767
Part of the spotnet which puts a lot more power at merized

345
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,119
Scale their scaling up

346
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
It's so yes

347
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,959
Is this good news now

348
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
This is bad news and

349
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
Depending on how the technology is

350
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,359
Figured so if it has a hard-coded password

351
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
If the password hasn't been changed

352
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,735
Mariah even if you take it off the machine is just going to

353
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
Come right back

354
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,343
So some of these devices are going to be compromised forever

355
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,391
And we'll just have to take them offline

356
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
I'm in some of them probably can be

357
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Text

358
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
So

359
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Semi-good news

360
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,559
Bad news

361
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
Speaking of security

362
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
That's actually

363
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:40,287
This is a really interesting story so this came out this week and this is from the Verizon 2017 data breach

364
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Digest

365
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
Which is a

366
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Report

367
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,711
What happens here is a named University

368
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,015
Basically had its iot Network

369
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,343
Compromised and then turned against itself

370
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
So what happened is B

371
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,487
Vending machines printers and other connected objects that are kind of part of the

372
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,023
The iot for this particular

373
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
University

374
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,607
Basically they were hacked and then they started

375
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,935
Looking up Seafood searches which is held

376
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
People love

377
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
Citrus ending

378
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:16,383
There were over 5,000 discrete systems making hundreds of DNS lookups every 15 min

379
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,199
So this is basically grounded their Network to

380
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:25,343
In the button it actually was spread from device to device by brute forcing default in

381
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,647
Password so does the same thing that was happen

382
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
Mirai

383
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,231
And once it was known the mall where

384
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
Malware had full control a device

385
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,399
And it would basically change the devices password and locking everybody out of that system

386
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,215
So this is really nasty stuff

387
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,799
Here is kind of separate your Networks

388
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
This is going to be a

389
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
Breezy world

390
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:55,295
Iot devices that are systems or other

391
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Websites

392
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,391
If there's 4 turned against themselves we're going to see

393
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
Stores that can

394
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
Curtis actions

395
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,303
Medical Center Hospital

396
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Catastrophic

397
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
So

398
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,631
Do better

399
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
Yeah

400
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,751
We don't know that the university but the best soon as

401
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:21,151
You mentioned this story I'm thinking now you know my son just started college there are connected vending machines and every floor the dorms with

402
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:27,807
Card readers in what. He was just complaining about slow Network the other day and that's what the more the first tip-off seven issue were in

403
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
Particular report

404
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,207
And it's not my son's interest I don't think it's just you know just get me got me thinking you know

405
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
How many people can be impacted by

406
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:41,631
Such a seemingly small thing right one little thing gets into that Network and all the sudden

407
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
You know these guys

408
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
Texas University locked out of

409
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
5000 systems

410
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,823
What's the impact is huge

411
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,383
And there's a lot of connected stuff out there

412
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
Yeah

413
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
Soho

414
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Okay

415
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
Moving from security to

416
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
Back to the echo actually

417
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,391
Play so I just thought this was an interesting stat so I thought I'd share it with Parks Associates

418
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
This week

419
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:09,279
Put out a report that says 2 to 4% of us Broadband households have purchased an echo

420
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
In the past 6 months

421
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
That's

422
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
Totally

423
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:18,751
Interesting and we were running we are running Friday survey

424
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:22,335
In of the people who responded with things they bought

425
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
Bye

426
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:30,015
Google home in the Amazon Echo are like 200 people

427
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,551
The last six months which is crazy

428
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
And I'm not surprised I mean it's

429
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,671
It's really taking off because it provides

430
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:40,511
That invisible voice interface to do so many different things

431
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
You know as well as getting

432
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Getting information

433
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,631
To you and I may be enjoying music and so on

434
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
What it is

435
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,727
The poster child for the smart home these days end

436
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
In a related stat just

437
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,615
I think it was yesterday before Amazon had shared its quarterly numbers

438
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,455
They broke out their revenue for subscriptions

439
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,759
And it was like so I can

440
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,831
I don't recall the exact number but some analysts did

441
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
Some math and said you know

442
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
There's about

443
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,767
64 million Prime subscribers send that jumped out of

444
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,071
That's because not just for the revenue

445
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:15,839
But also

446
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:19,935
That's a huge potential user base for the echo devices because you really

447
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
Want

448
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
I think it's part of all this and

449
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,055
I could see a lot of prime people keep

450
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,871
Take an extra pad echosign add smart on blanks

451
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:32,479
So with this in mind if you are one of those people who purchased an echo they recommend

452
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
Couple things for you

453
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
Because

454
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
My far away

455
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
The most useful Echo skills

456
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
Smart Home

457
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
So

458
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
If you are

459
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
Kind of a nervous Nelly

460
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,583
I would say to take your first Quick Step into a smart

461
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,423
I will connect you to the Philips Hue bulbs into some lamps

462
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,215
Or I would say 42

463
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Chipper

464
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
Experience

465
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,103
Pick up a few WeMo switches there about $35 and

466
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,431
Just connect those and then you can suddenly control your lamps

467
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Voice

468
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
It's freaky

469
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,575
Awesome it's a starter gives you a taste of what you can do and

470
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,367
And I've said before replacing

471
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,159
Physical switches with voice

472
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:17,535
Interaction is just the baby steps when you start connecting things to do things based on

473
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:21,887
Actions that makes things smart but this is a great way to dip your toe in the water

474
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
Migraine

475
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
You're going to like it

476
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,287
Stop right there did you guys

477
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,615
Stop the presses just because you were talking about this

478
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,711
I don't know if you guys talked about it last week when I was not here apologize

479
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,759
The Amazon tap

480
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Is now

481
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:45,695
Look at that so and I say this because the tap is cheaper than a full Echo although the

482
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,511
Echo Dot

483
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
But the tap which is a battery-powered

484
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
Echo device

485
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,167
Previously you had to literally tap the button

486
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,727
And then you would speak your commands and make things happen

487
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
But now

488
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
I said they should have done from the beginning

489
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,335
You can

490
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,407
Guest voice control setting in the

491
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
App that

492
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,479
Disappointed that I want to say cuz it's her name

493
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,527
That you can just enable the Wake word

494
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,391
And I tested it out works great so now I've got a tap down in my dining room where

495
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
Now I can just

496
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,232
Speaking control lights and do things it's a beautiful thing

497
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:25,632
It is plugged in for me all the time except when I take it outside on the deck but now there's winter I'm not doing that

498
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
I thought they should

499
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,008
Or would add this feature if and only if it was

500
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
Sitting on the

501
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
Base charging

502
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,944
But no it can be done when your on battery power it will reduce the battery life not the battery like but the actual

503
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,016
Length of time you can run on a charge they say about 8 hours

504
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,040
Because of the

505
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,088
Coding for always listening functionality

506
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
Okay that's

507
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
How long does it last

508
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,232
I haven't tested but they say about 8 hours

509
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,304
Which is probably only one to two hours

510
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,608
Rest and it would be without that

511
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:02,240
You don't have to use the future you couldn't save your battery life and turn the Wake word off in which case it's a manual tap

512
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,104
Let's see now we're going to get into Mobile World Congress is

513
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,456
It is such a two weeks from now

514
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,736
Who am I what day is it

515
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,368
So it is two weeks for now we're already starting to see a rush of news about

516
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
This is where Kevin

517
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,024
Bear with me because this is actually a big deal

518
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,864
So one of the things we talked a lot about are these low-power wide area

519
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,424
And basically these are

520
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
Networks design

521
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
For the internet

522
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
They said really tiny amounts of data but the cool thing is they send it that they cover huge areas so like cities

523
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Entire

524
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Counties

525
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
And it's

526
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,480
It's kind of like the cellular

527
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,272
But it's not always

528
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
That's where it gets low

529
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,624
AT&T is going to launch

530
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
And iot net

531
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
This

532
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
June

533
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,232
Chats which is actually pretty

534
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,792
Amazing and I use a standard called LTE

535
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,328
And this is

536
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
A cellular standard

537
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,680
Bifurcated

538
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:10,592
Two networks but they're going to take it to these very small

539
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,384
Verizon is also doing

540
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
An LTE

541
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
At 1

542
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,992
So these are going to be like

543
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
Hopefully cheaper

544
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
We're still waiting

545
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
Pricing on these butt

546
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
It should be interesting

547
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,160
With things like

548
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,208
Laura and sigfox

549
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Some of the other

550
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
Networks that are out there

551
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
So

552
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
Also

553
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
On the cellular side

554
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,888
Nokia has done

555
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,168
I don't even know how to say

556
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,728
Created a network called

557
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
Wing

558
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
Which is basically

559
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,568
Cellular

560
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
It's going to have some

561
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,896
I think it's going to have some satellite yes

562
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,456
Cellular satellite

563
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
It might even have

564
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,296
Laura other networks I don't

565
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
Actually no

566
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,624
Nokia says are not going to be buying Spectrum

567
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
For this so

568
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,720
They're going to be grabbing Network

569
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,792
Capacity from its customers basically a service provider

570
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
Customers

571
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:06,656
Doing deals for that and then they're going to create this Global Network

572
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
Curvy large Enterprise

573
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,032
And those companies can basically go to notes

574
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
Kia or they can

575
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,336
It sounds like

576
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,896
Nokia will also white label this

577
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,712
For cellular providers so cellular providers

578
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
Can then

579
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
If you are like

580
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,064
A company that's doing Logistics you can actually go to you

581
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
Your carrier

582
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
A carrier

583
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,624
Where in say hey

584
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
Global Connect

585
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:33,280
And I think that's the key difference when you mention AT&T and Verizon and whatnot

586
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,816
They're not implementing anything with

587
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
Satellite as of yet

588
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,912
Understandable reasons given their there

589
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
Company focused

590
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,496
This seems to be like a

591
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,568
A solution offering where Nokia is going to say look you know

592
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,872
Doesn't matter

593
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,920
Matter what kind of data you need

594
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
We can offer it

595
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,480
Multiple

596
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
Network setup

597
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,296
What's seamless to you but

598
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,600
For us we're going to use either satellite or

599
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
Use cellular

600
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
So4

601
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,976
Shipping bike overseas and such

602
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,024
You know they can offer something that

603
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
Carriers right now don't seem to be interested in

604
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
Cargo ship

605
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Because I think

606
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
It's fascinating

607
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,496
And I realize this but

608
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Because the

609
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
Containers

610
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Strapped down

611
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,200
And they're just got piled high in high seas

612
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,528
There's like a large number of them can just fall overboard

613
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
The shipment service

614
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,696
I was going to send this and I'm like oh

615
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,232
And you know they expected

616
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,256
Stash's Subs

617
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
The top of the

618
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,216
You could actually fight

619
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
Or at least see where they

620
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,336
Also

621
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,616
Story is

622
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
I tell you

623
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,944
Is also introducing

624
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,760
A network in this network is actually going to be

625
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,368
A long-distance low-power Network

626
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
It does not use cellular

627
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
It's much cheaper

628
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,280
They're working with inmarsat satellite provider in Satellite is actually

629
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,560
The backhaul for this

630
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
Wherever you're putting your radios

631
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
And then it'll talk back up to

632
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
It'll go to the internet

633
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,824
Through an inmarsat satellite

634
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,872
Which means you got like a Lora Network

635
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Work on a ship

636
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,712
You have a Lora Network in the middle of Lake nowhere Australia

637
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,528
It's actually really cool if we actually

638
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,600
I did a story in the newsletter

639
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,904
I think it was about wiring up a volcano

640
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,024
One of the technologies that were using as Laura and

641
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
Carrabba

642
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
And

643
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,376
That might be a good solution for that

644
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,936
What's interesting is I think

645
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,984
IRT is probably one of the

646
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Best

647
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,056
Use cases for satellite

648
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
In that

649
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,664
We've seen Satellite Communication in satellite internet

650
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:03,552
And so on when you're bouncing your signals up to 22,000 miles up into space and back down

651
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,624
You reduce latency right so there's a delay

652
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,440
So it's not ideal paper video conferencing

653
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:14,048
I might say something on a video call with you Stacy

654
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,376
And you see my lips move and then two seconds later you hear the sound

655
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
For example

656
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,216
But for iot it kind of doesn't matter

657
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
Right unless it's

658
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,848
Unless it's like I'm a security type thing where you need no latency

659
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
So buttfor

660
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,688
Logistics and tracking

661
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,480
Just general-purpose IBT

662
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,552
Satellite is actually probably at fantastic

663
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,088
Way to boost coverage

664
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
Quite honestly

665
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,672
Because there's small amounts

666
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
Data going

667
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
It's

668
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
Going to be more

669
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
Satellite ride terrible

670
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,352
Even easier

671
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
It's just

672
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
Function of a technology

673
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
I think you're right

674
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,776
Astute observation Kevin

675
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,824
That's cuz I'm on my third cup of coffee now

676
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,128
Alright let's talk

677
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,664
Let's let's move on to

678
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,760
Out of networking and let's hook up Tim Cook the CEO of Apple and how he uses

679
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Homekit

680
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,600
I know that I am I'm overdue for using

681
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Cancer next week

682
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
About that

683
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,672
But Tim Cook

684
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
He apparently has outfit

685
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,512
Expensive house with

686
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
Homekit

687
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
So he

688
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
He says good morning to Siri

689
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
And his house lights

690
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,424
And his coffee starts Brewing

691
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,728
My hunches his coffee is probably

692
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
We plugged into an idevice

693
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:32,128
I was just going to ask how you know what coffee maker is homekit compatible

694
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
Believe that there is

695
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
Do I

696
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,528
Chelsea Wenzel

697
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,088
My hunch is he's probably using a switch

698
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
Coffee maker is already set

699
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,672
So that's still good

700
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
I can't

701
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,744
Personal use that cuz I had to press a button

702
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,072
Tim Cook

703
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:51,840
I can probably

704
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,400
Afford it really automatically

705
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,984
I'm guessing he knows an engineer to that can help with that problem

706
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,800
Beautiful aluminium

707
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,592
Farragut

708
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,664
Jesus he's doing that he's got a

709
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
He sets his thermostat

710
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,760
And he also is created and I'm home command

711
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
Which

712
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,064
I have also created a

713
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,160
I'm his controls the lights and thermostats and window shades

714
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,976
So what I would like to see

715
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Is

716
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
Tim Cook

717
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
I need to tell Siri i'm

718
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,120
Am I just going to set up a sensor

719
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,144
And when this happens

720
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,168
It's going to work

721
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:30,496
He does apparently use geofencing so

722
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:35,616
Could have that that smarts implemented at this point it's not clear from the CNET

723
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,896
Article interview

724
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
It was on

725
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
Conference

726
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,992
RSV

727
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,552
He's selling home

728
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,672
I use it and so should you

729
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
IAAI

730
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,768
All right

731
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
So

732
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,072
Let's get to

733
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,096
My Xperia

734
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,912
Two Networks

735
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,936
Yes

736
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,752
I talked about this a long time ago actually

737
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,056
It came up first because of the Mirai botnet

738
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,128
And I have to tell you

739
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,688
After like two and a half months and that it wasn't working

740
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
Religiously

741
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,760
This is not to

742
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,648
Chris AC feels the pain so you don't have to

743
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,952
So here's what I would recommend

744
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,488
Because

745
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,768
In the challenges are there

746
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
You don't

747
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,584
I want to control things

748
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,632
Sometimes for my smartphone

749
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,192
So my smartphone needs to be on the Wi-Fi

750
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
For certain

751
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
Locations to work

752
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,336
The same network that either your hub Android devices are on

753
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
Yes

754
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,432
So if I put everything on one network then I can't

755
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
Use my

756
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
My phone

757
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,528
Where if I put everything

758
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:52,928
Including my phone but not my computer

759
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
You could

760
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:59,072
If you want to put your phone on one network and a separate Network just for your

761
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
Computer

762
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
That is doable

763
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,424
You just can't use your computer frame

764
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,216
I think which is fine unless you're working

765
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
No it's actually fun

766
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,568
Unless you're pulling data

767
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
And that would be

768
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
Don't think there's

769
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Else

770
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
If you want to login

771
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:25,696
So that's a possibility but then you can't do any banking or buying things on your phone you have to remember to always use your

772
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
Gordon quotes

773
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,280
Here's a thought you could

774
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:35,680
This is not ideal by any means but you could actually separate things to a point by not even having your phone on your home Wi-Fi

775
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:40,288
And I say that because we talked earlier about the pixel on the smart home controls

776
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:47,200
I actually now that I'm thinking about not have my third cup of coffee I turn my Wi-Fi off on my phone just to see if I could

777
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:50,784
Remotely control my WeMo switches using Voice

778
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,600
And it worked I was over in LTE network then

779
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,440
And that didn't work it was a little bit more lack of course because now you're talkin about another Network

780
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,256
Essentially I separated things to some degree there

781
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
I'm not saying this is ideal

782
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Cuz it's not

783
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
But

784
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
But you could do it that way

785
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Yes you

786
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,472
The other thing I did

787
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,752
Is

788
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
So so that's my idea of a guest

789
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
But then

790
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,944
You probably should have two guest networks you shouldn't iot Network and then your guest Network for natural gas

791
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,248
You cannot control your attitude gadgets

792
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,808
Was a terrible idea

793
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
And everybody

794
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,136
Yeah

795
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,672
Head okay

796
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,208
What do I most care about

797
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,232
I care about my Mikey

798
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
Garage door opener

799
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
I care about any locks

800
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:39,424
Z-Wave lock so I decided not to care about those but if I had like an August lock or something that talked

801
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,496
Via Bluetooth sore and then had a Wi-Fi remote

802
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
I might Karen

803
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,848
I care about cameras because

804
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
All the time

805
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,176
Manors at privacy

806
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,224
So you can

807
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,528
You can put your cameras

808
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
On a separate

809
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:01,952
You actually could put your locks I didn't try that because I don't have

810
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
I don't have enough

811
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
August Locker

812
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
Or I don't have a Wi-Fi

813
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
But you can't do that

814
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,656
And

815
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
That is

816
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Les Payne

817
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
You're so then you would end up with

818
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,544
Basically

819
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
Gesnetwork

820
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,640
That has your iot devices on it

821
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,968
If you're okay with your guess having a

822
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,296
Access to the which most people would not be I wouldn't think but

823
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
So then you're gonna have to set up

824
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,928
Let me tell you

825
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,720
This is going to be my pro-tip

826
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
For everyone out there in

827
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
It's too late I'm sorry

828
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
Going forward

829
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,328
Do this

830
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
Use your guest Network

831
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,424
Because

832
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,728
In this day and age

833
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
It is silly

834
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,056
I agree

835
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,336
If any of your devices

836
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
Compromised

837
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,944
Network Bad Dudes

838
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,992
Even if it's like you're at your kids

839
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,040
I mean like I would never let my

840
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,344
Kids friends have access to my bank

841
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,624
Because oh my God

842
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,696
Their computer I barely want my daughter to have access to my

843
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,512
Computers are festering disease holes of

844
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,536
God only knows

845
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,144
Divide

846
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,936
I called this divide and fail to conquer

847
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,216
Experiment

848
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Networks

849
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,312
I wonder if there is a product opportunity here

850
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,200
For improved firewalling for IRT in today's routers and War

851
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
A separate

852
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,296
Bridge or router specifically for IRT

853
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,624
That will only allow certain traffic to pass

854
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Last week's

855
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
Grant night

856
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
What about some

857
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
Stuff

858
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,024
There are some routers that have

859
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,840
More transparency capabilities or the following

860
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,912
Traffic patterns of devices and then say

861
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,008
Write what I think would be really interesting

862
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,800
Is doing it at

863
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Protocol

864
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,592
Also

865
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,152
Actually we've from Google is thinking about

866
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
It's saying hey

867
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,296
This door lock should never need to talk

868
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,880
This camera should never have to talk to

869
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
I actually should talk

870
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
Got your lights The Nest actually does

871
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
There's

872
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,536
A way to do it that way but it's probably kind of

873
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
Limited

874
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,192
I don't know

875
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,752
About that because as you were describing it

876
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,288
When I first start thinking was

877
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,592
That kind of sounds like Android app permission

878
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:30,432
Only it's now device level permissions from device device

879
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,456
So

880
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:35,552
I don't know if it would be that computer intensive I think it just needs to be done at the setup

881
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
Point

882
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,392
And you know and then the rules are enforced going forward

883
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,952
Yeah I'm just taking it

884
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
New device

885
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,560
Like let's say I set up a device

886
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
And it's

887
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,656
Cuz there's two way communication so

888
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,752
Then when I bring something new on the network I can set its permissions but I have to go back inside the

889
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
Emissions

890
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,824
I mean I can be done

891
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,872
One Fell Swoop I think

892
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,432
Yeah I don't I don't see why I couldn't be

893
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,504
I'm on it I'm so on it

894
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,576
I'll leave I'll need a fourth cup of coffee

895
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
Before we go

896
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,928
We should say August's has

897
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,000
Added the ability to unlock your device from your

898
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,560
Security issue

899
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
Oh my gosh

900
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
Holiday Inn

901
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,520
You have to tell the echo to unlock your August locks and then you have to give up

902
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
So

903
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,616
Simple

904
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,920
Elegant and hopefully nobody who wants to

905
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,968
Get into your house will actually

906
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,016
In the room with you when you give set

907
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:44,672
There is there is that but not I love this invitation I don't have an August lock

908
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,488
But I'd if I did I'd be thrilled right now because

909
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:51,328
I don't think any of the locks really allowed for unlocking an s

910
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,656
Again as you set a security issue udoka some anybody

911
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,240
With a voice can talk to an echo and say hey that's unlock the door

912
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:03,104
This ad the security Factor locking is not a problem so that's that we can all do

913
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,640
But this I think this is great

914
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,688
All right

915
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,712
Lettuce

916
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,528
Take a moment for a word from our sponsor and then after that

917
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,296
We will have

918
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,344
Jenny Fielding

919
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,136
Techstars iot accelerator

920
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,952
I want to talk about investing in the internet

921
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,864
I'll see you next week

922
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,752
Hey everyone

923
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:35,872
We're dropping the podcast for a message from our sponsor sponsor is spin dance

924
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,968
And I have Brian toll here who's going to tell us a little bit about spending

925
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
What is the thing you guys do

926
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:46,368
We are a full-service iot consultancy which basically means we help organization

927
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648
Design

928
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,416
Develop

929
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:51,744
And manage their iot software

930
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,024
Sounds like Ford Motor Co

931
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,864
Company in Whirlpool but we also work with a lot of smaller companies and even startups

932
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
Okay so why would it

933
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,656
Company like

934
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
Ford Aurora

935
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,008
We help them develop their iot products

936
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:09,408
That's usually a combination of embedded cloud and mobile software it's not a typical for an organization to have one of those skills

937
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:13,248
But they rarely have really good iot developers in all three of those

938
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,064
And we work really hard to bring a team together that not only under

939
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,440
Stan's embedded in cloud in Mobile but knows how to work together and knows how to bring those skills into the iot

940
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:26,560
He space example developers aren't just great at developing apps they really

941
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,352
And how to build apps that work

942
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:34,752
Seamlessly with Cloud over the better software

943
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,032
The provides 24 hours

944
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,848
Yes we do have a team that provides 24/7

945
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,616
Support

946
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,176
And that's really important with with iot products

947
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:47,552
Cuz obviously the product is out in the field that's working want to make sure that the software that powers it

948
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,648
It is always up and running would people want to use it all right if I have software developer

949
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
Where is already on

950
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
But I still need you guys

951
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,000
Absolutely wheel of collaboration

952
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
We love work with other developer

953
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,584
We really like to work hand-in-hand

954
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,680
So just a quick story we recently developed a mobile app for a large

955
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
Manufacturer

956
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,752
They already had their firmware team

957
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
Tiemann place

958
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,568
And just needed our mobile

959
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,664
Used to work with them so we developed a great collaborative relationship to get there

960
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,480
Homekit app out the door and then into the market

961
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,528
You guys sound really smart really good

962
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
So you have any advice for

963
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,136
There's two common mistakes that we see a lot of organization

964
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:29,792
Making the first is a lot of businesses are really good about developing an iot prototype but then they don't really

965
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,584
Take the time to develop that into

966
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,632
Full-blown go-to-market app

967
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,448
Application they're forgetting things like security the forgetting

968
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:41,056
Software updates they haven't thought about analytics and know they're all really important things

969
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,104
To have when you go into the market

970
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,408
We take a lot of the mistakes we've seen in the

971
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,808
The Press you know the big denial-of-service attack from a couple months ago a lot of that just comes down to an experience

972
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
On the iot developer

973
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,880
Inside another big problem that we see

974
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,416
Is a lack of overall

975
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,720
Design we see a lot of organization

976
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
Dalian

977
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,792
Embedded portion of an iot app for

978
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
The cloud Porsche

979
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,352
Another mobile portion all in Iceland

980
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,144
And they're not thinking about the

981
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
The system design

982
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,728
That's how all these components are going to work together

983
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,752
The greatest seamless

984
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,800
Experience

985
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,896
Early everybody should that's the best way to develop iOS application

986
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,176
I'm all in

987
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
Your system design

988
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:19,968
So where can

989
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
People learn more

990
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:27,136
If they'd like to download a white paper they can go to spin dance.com coyote and we always luggage

And we're here to talk

1005
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,304
About trends

1006
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
That she sees

1007
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,632
In startups and also

1008
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
Hopefully in like

1009
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
Debenture in exit

1010
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,264
So let's kick it off with

1011
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,824
Text stars for the people who don't know

1012
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:18,848
What is it

1013
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,480
Well first of all thank you so much for having me then the big fan of yours so it's great to be here

1014
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,296
Techstars where a venture capital fund

1015
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:32,672
And we invest in entrepreneurs at all stages of their entrepreneurial Journey

1016
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:38,304
And so what that means is we have things called startup programs you probably heard of startup weekend

1017
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
Weekend bootcamp

1018
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:44,448
It's for people that want to let you know work on projects and potentially start companies down the road

1019
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,520
We have accelerator programs which are three months

1020
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,568
Mentor driven intense

1021
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,128
Programs around the world so we're on

1022
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,407
25 of those

1023
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943
And then we have a venture capital

1024
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,991
Fondant we're on our third fun

1025
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
So

1026
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,063
We do a lot of different things that I techstars

1027
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,367
And I focus on Internet of Things

1028
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,695
Which means that I run accelerator program

1029
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:08,255
An investment company is around

1030
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,559
Which is awesome

1031
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,143
I'm excited because you guys are now in your

1032
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,959
With your iot program and

1033
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,495
You just did a kind of

1034
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
Eton College mod

1035
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,103
Which means you are accepting applications for

1036
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,383
New companies

1037
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,407
And when is sat deadline

1038
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:29,503
Yeah so this is actually our fourth iot program

1039
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,063
And the deadline is April 9th

1040
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,391
You can find out all the information on our website

1041
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,951
And towards the end of this interview

1042
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,743
What she is

1043
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,327
Specifically looking for any tips she kind of has her anyway

1044
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,655
So stay tuned for that but first

1045
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,215
We're going to get a sense of where we are in the

1046
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,567
So what are you saying I know you've been traveling around

1047
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,383
Are there big trends bubbling up

1048
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,735
You know when we started investing in iot a few years ago

1049
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:07,391
We were really focused on consumer because I think that that's really where the landscape was it was

1050
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,927
This idea that

1051
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,743
Like I like to call Tino Hardware 2.0

1052
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,559
Entrepreneurs were realizing that it was

1053
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,839
Buy a vault

1054
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,679
But not a lot of money and not a lot of resources to actually start Hardware

1055
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,007
Great rebirth

1056
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
What are first class we had

1057
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,079
Really cool companies

1058
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,615
You might have heard of Outlet

1059
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,151
Which is the baby monitor

1060
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:34,015
Keen home which is a smart and many others we really got to understand

1061
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
The consumer space

1062
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,111
And II program

1063
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,695
We decided to take some chances and really look at B2B

1064
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:47,327
We branched out invest in a company called filament which is doing Wireless Mesh networking and

1065
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:52,703
Chargify which is wireless charging and our last program we decided that we wanted

1066
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,007
How to focus on Industrial B2B

1067
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
We had

1068
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:59,871
Companies across verticals and Healthcare construction Toc Logistics

1069
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,663
But with a focus on B2B

1070
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:05,503
Will be continuing that Trend in the snacks are 4th program

1071
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,063
Focused again on B2B and Industrial

1072
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,087
So it's

1073
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:14,207
Breakfast down because this is something you know why I say that this is the Internet of Things podcast but

1074
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,023
There is definitely the smart home I think of

1075
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:22,143
Industrial being Factory in that sort of thing but then I also think of Enterprise and that be

1076
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,191
Hill Campus building management

1077
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,751
Happy Workforce things Fleet Logistics

1078
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,031
And then maybe there's Medical

1079
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,359
When I try to start classifying this stuff I'm like

1080
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,175
So do you have a class B

1081
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,479
Vacation kind of system that you're thinking of

1082
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
And working from

1083
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:41,599
What's a really interesting point I think you know iot

1084
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,159
Is really morphing into you no internet

1085
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,719
Of everything and so at you know I kind of joke

1086
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:50,047
The people that I hope that I will be out of a job in

1087
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,327
2 years because

1088
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,727
To three years because we won't really be calling things iot anymore will just be calling them things

1089
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,031
In the same way that you know

1090
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:03,103
Mobile was a vertical oin vest

1091
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:03,871
In Mobile

1092
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,919
Now people don't really say that because everything

1093
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,967
Thing is mobile so we see that as it can

1094
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:13,343
And that iot is really in fuses all areas of our lives so

1095
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,391
In fact. I also joke

1096
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:19,743
People say well how many iot companies has techstars invested in I say

1097
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
Well between

1098
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,583
60 and 75 depending on how you

1099
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,375
Define iot that day

1100
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,935
What kind of go into this idea of

1101
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
Security

1102
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,751
Because I think it's

1103
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,567
He's one of those Technologies we're still not sure how we're going to

1104
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,847
Scale security

1105
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
For the internet

1106
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,967
So are you seeing anything particularly novel or exciting

1107
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
Happening there

1108
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,831
Well you know I think the the two barriers were

1109
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:49,183
What's an iot you to me are around interoperability and security

1110
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,975
Before we see you know why

1111
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,999
Brad adoption

1112
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:58,399
But interesting Lee I'm not seeing a ton of startups work on this and so it's it's something that I always talk about

1113
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,679
Kind of in my newsletter when

1114
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:03,007
I'm speaking as likes to have to be more startups that are working on

1115
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
Security

1116
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
So much

1117
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,103
Focus on on Cyber

1118
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:12,991
But really that intersection of actual physical product and cyber we haven't seen a ton

1119
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,271
So yeah there are cement

1120
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:18,111
Purchasing companies working on it there's a few in Israel that I recently met

1121
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:22,719
But definitely not enough so I think it's a huge area of opportunity for startups

1122
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:28,607
And then the other is the operability and I'm not sure that startups are going to figure that out or

1123
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,935
If it's really about standards that larger companies

1124
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:36,799
Whether it's Google or Amazon are going to sort out but definitely something that needs

1125
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,335
To be handled I think

1126
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,151
In order for consumers to have

1127
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,967
Really seamless experience with iot

1128
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
Right now you here a lot

1129
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,575
People talking while it's not the smart home it's the dumb home

1130
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:54,975
Because things aren't really working with each other and you know I think that you're going to see a continuation of that skepticism until

1131
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,279
We sort out some of those fundamental shoes

1132
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,839
Is true although voices Bender

1133
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,375
Unifier for a lot of

1134
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,191
Even though it's like an overlay on top of

1135
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,519
Many many standard herbs but yes it's it's

1136
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
I should ask you

1137
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,103
You actually about voice because

1138
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,407
Just like you were mentioning mobile like I invest

1139
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:18,015
It feels like we went from a mobile-first and we're now moving into this concept of

1140
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,039
Voice first

1141
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,367
And that's going to affect things like how we decide

1142
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
Build stuff

1143
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,719
And I am very curious have you seen any

1144
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
Companies

1145
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,791
Doing stuff there did you guys have any

1146
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
Companies doing stuff

1147
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:37,471
You know we are actually running a program in conjunction with Amazon call the Alexa accelerator specifically

1148
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,007
Play to explore areas

1149
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,287
With invoice so

1150
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:43,871
It's an area that I think it's about being in that we're really interested in

1151
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:49,759
I think there's an overlay between the automation we've seen kind of in the bot world

1152
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,807
And the boys world

1153
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:58,207
We're seeing all of those Technologies now come together but I think you're right it is the next Evolution from

1154
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
Mobility

1155
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:05,375
So seen a lot of companies I haven't invested in any of them yet and it's definitely an area that were interested in forearm

1156
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,935
Moving to a voice first world

1157
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,727
What are some of the challenges

1158
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
That you see

1159
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,311
For example I feel like we don't really have

1160
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:19,711
Pinch-to-zoom for Boise is how I think of it but like accepted that goes across all platforms

1161
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
Talk to something

1162
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
Which means

1163
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,551
It's really hard still

1164
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,111
Command things via voice cuz it's not quite natural

1165
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,951
So that's one and I don't know what other kind of challenges there might

1166
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,511
Especially if you're talking about bring it to the Enterprise

1167
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:38,911
But I think that you know natural language hasn't exactly become a norm yet right and so

1168
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,703
You're Siri

1169
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:44,799
Isn't always giving you exactly what you need and so if I know

1170
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,383
In the consumer space I think it's probably okay but

1171
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,967
You know that those nuances with natural language processing

1172
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,271
Think have to come to bear before week

1173
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:58,879
Can apply them effectively in the industrial space right if you think about

1174
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,183
Voice operating an airplane

1175
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:05,023
Right you want to be pretty sure that the commands are correct

1176
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:11,423
I think those are some of the challenges we'll see when it comes to us a self-driving cars or

1177
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,727
Or planes are or things like that

1178
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,031
A lack of trust

1179
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,359
It's kind of been one of the issues that that I stay with us

1180
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,455
Or just

1181
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,479
Step 2 platform

1182
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
Robust enough

1183
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,271
Yeah

1184
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,111
There's a natural Caden

1185
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,903
That leads us from start to

1186
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,183
Definition of conversation

1187
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,999
And can the chat replicate that

1188
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:39,583
Think that were close but we're not exactly there

1189
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:45,983
Enzo again like in the consumer space I think we know we're probably okay for assisting our virtual assistant screw that up

1190
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,799
But you know in the in the business

1191
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:51,871
Arena I think that the implications can be

1192
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,431
So that makes me a little bit

1193
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,711
A little bit nervous

1194
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,759
Okay so you guys are in

1195
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:02,623
New York and they're iot kind of hubs all around the country and all around the world

1196
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,159
What do you think makes a

1197
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:04,927
Good

1198
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,695
Iot

1199
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:09,279
That's a great question and one I'm exploring right now I'm on a

1200
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,583
A pretty big trip around the world

1201
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,167
What are places that I am spending a lot of time with

1202
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,959
These days is in Germany

1203
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,775
And specifically in Berlin and Munich

1204
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,055
Sing a lot

1205
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,591
Start up there and I think

1206
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
Part of it has

1207
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,663
To do with you know kind of legacy

1208
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,735
Industries in those areas right and so

1209
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,807
If you're looking at industrial iot for example

1210
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:38,207
A lot of people there who have a lot of experience in industrial sectors because of them being

1211
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:41,791
So prevalent they are so whether it's Mobility weather is factories

1212
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:46,399
You know we're seeing a lot of interesting companies come out of those areas so I think that's

1213
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,191
Something to look at

1214
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:51,519
That's one of the reasons that I'm excited about New York if you think

1215
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,823
The history of manufacturing and

1216
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,175
Everything that's happened you know in New Jersey and and places like that

1217
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,503
Make sense that New York would bubble up

1218
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,551
As being in a place where

1219
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,831
Iot startups

1220
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,855
Get some tracks

1221
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:12,767
So you know PCB boards are actually built you know across the way in New Jersey so just makes a ton of sense

1222
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,327
To see those communities pop up here

1223
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:19,167
But you know he's obviously see large Pockets out on the West Coast

1224
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:24,031
Or staying a little bit and where you are in Austin and indefinitely we always

1225
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,591
I'm from the Midwest

1226
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:33,503
So it sounds like you need some sort of maybe manufacturing experience or history

1227
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:37,343
You probably need do you need venture capital or do you need

1228
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,391
Big Partners to test out

1229
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
Concept

1230
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:44,767
I think that Venture when it comes to hardware and iot

1231
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:51,167
Is pretty specific and yes you need you need that Capital but I don't think you need to be around that capital

1232
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
Sentara Leigh

1233
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:56,543
I think that Venture investors who are interested in those spaces are used

1234
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,847
Two traveling around quite a bit

1235
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,871
To invest in

1236
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:06,271
Companies where they see it you know the good ecosystem but you know like all startups having access to engineer's and

1237
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,063
You know if you have a hardware device

1238
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:14,207
You also need electrical engineering industrial designers you know those things are pretty specific

1239
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:18,559
With startups because one of the things especially as we move into Industrial

1240
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,583
Is it

1241
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,935
A challenge for them or how should they think about selling to these mammoth

1242
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,471
Companies because if I am

1243
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,031
If my job is making turbines

1244
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,311
I want to work with the

1245
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
The company that I

1246
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,871
Entrust is supposed to

1247
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:32,895
A startup

1248
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,431
So how are they navigating

1249
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,991
Bad customer acquisition

1250
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,783
Yeah that is X

1251
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:45,183
Play great question it's when we thought about you know quite a bit so we're on our first iot program

1252
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:48,767
We only ran them with one corporate partner what we realized is that

1253
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:54,399
Iot is very specific and has a lot of challenges especially if you're developing Hardware firmware

1254
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,423
Software all

1255
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,471
Solitaire elements and so

1256
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:03,359
We think that surrounding startups with corporate Partners who can provide guidance to the startups and also

1257
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:06,175
Partner with them early on give them a sense of

1258
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,991
Legitimacy in the market can be super helpful

1259
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:12,575
We think that partnering with corporates

1260
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:18,975
One way to do it and you see a lot of the accelerators whether it's xlerator has partnered with BMW Mini

1261
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,815
For their program or you know there's there's so many other one

1262
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:25,119
And it's very complimentary

1263
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:29,983
In our program one of our startups did a white paper and with PWC

1264
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,263
Answer that brought down

1265
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:35,103
Kind of a sense of credibility that then they were able to go out

1266
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,919
An approaching very large construction companies

1267
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,455
And during the program

1268
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:43,807
This company called pillar was able to get a signed pilot

1269
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,623
Done a lot of that

1270
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:49,439
Do with the credibility that PWC was able to bring them

1271
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
Nice

1272
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:54,303
And I do like in this could be just strong

1273
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,631
I feel like there's a lot more strategic investing

1274
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,959
Kind of Enterprise in industrial iot

1275
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,007
I think that's exactly right

1276
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:03,775
Again

1277
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:08,639
Very hard Industries need a lot of capital to scale

1278
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:13,759
And I'm just make sense so one of our portfolio company is still a man

1279
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:19,647
They had a proper venture-capital lead for their last round but they also had Verizon

1280
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,415
Samsung

1281
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,439
Participate

1282
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:27,839
Because those Partners can really help give them the scale and the distribution so we are seeing you know a lot

1283
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,607
A lot of that

1284
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:32,447
If you look at Siemens and their Venture group next47

1285
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,751
Bashas Venture group GE

1286
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,823
These are very large large organizations

1287
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,687
And it just makes a lot of sense for them to be partnering with earlier stage companies

1288
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,503
And what about exits so

1289
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,783
Who is buying these

1290
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,551
Companies

1291
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:53,439
And are they going public is it again int such a huge space so it could differ unlike consumers I look

1292
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,463
Look at Fitbit and GoPro

1293
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,023
I'm just curious your thoughts

1294
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:04,703
Yeah well I mean we saw it last year was one of the best years for m&a iot in fact

1295
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:09,311
IRT was help driving all of m&a activity across stack

1296
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
That's really

1297
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,103
Interesting but

1298
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:17,503
You know Verizon was super busy spending billions of dollars on very Solutions everything from Smart cities

1299
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,527
Mobility

1300
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,551
Wifi

1301
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,575
Hugo Boss

1302
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,879
NGE were equally as busy

1303
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:29,023
With purchases so I think that there is real opportunity on that side you know these large company is

1304
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:35,679
They can't move fast enough they really need startups and then I'll take a position is the top-of-the-line for all of them

1305
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:42,079
I feel like 2017 is going to be kind of maybe.

1306
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,127
Although I like the sound of that in a headline

1307
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,711
I think there's going to be a lot of companies that are kind of going to go by the wayside

1308
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:54,623
And I think there's going to be a lot of m&a especially on the consumer side cuz we're seeing the end of a cycle that started probably in Twin

1309
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,159
2013 and 2012

1310
00:55:56,671 --> 00:56:01,791
So I'm just curious what you think we'll see in 2017 for kind of m&a

1311
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:04,607
Even maybe the end of some businesses

1312
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:08,703
Yeah Minnesota it's a great point I think investors rushed in

1313
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:14,847
About three years ago into Hardware people that had no experience investing in Hardware iot

1314
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:21,247
But you know got excited by Kickstarter got excited by you know a lot of the consumer companies that were coming

1315
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,807
And then had a little bit of a

1316
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:26,367
A shock when they realized how hard

1317
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,391
How hard it is

1318
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,951
Hardware company how much capital

1319
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:33,791
How difficult it can be coming up with new products

1320
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,351
Betty facturing in places like China

1321
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:39,679
All the difficulties in so I think we've seen a real retraction

1322
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:46,079
Which is actually good like the Venture capitalists who are really focused on it and know the market will double down and

1323
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:49,919
And everyone else will it will kind of go away so unfortunately for us

1324
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,199
Nars there has been

1325
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:55,295
You know somewhat less Capital especially in the seed stage

1326
00:56:55,807 --> 00:57:00,671
Or those early-stage hardware and iot companies as compared to a few years ago

1327
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:07,071
But I think that's okay I think that we don't need tons of me-too products and useless gadgets

1328
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:10,399
I'm really want to be funding on spinners that are

1329
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:14,751
Breaking barriers innovating and really thinking about what snack so

1330
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:19,871
In 2017 I think we're all very excited about you no autonomy and how that will impact

1331
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,407
Things like cars

1332
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:26,527
Airplanes I'm personally very excited about Healthcare I think there's still a lot to be done

1333
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,807
In Elder Care

1334
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:32,671
Excetera and I think that coyote you have a a big place to play with in that

1335
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:39,071
And again you know I hope we see some more Securities company is popping up that are working with an iot because

1336
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,607
I think there's a huge opportunity there

1337
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,167
Which is

1338
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:46,239
For your application process which again

1339
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,031
You should remind us of the day

1340
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,055

1341
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,335
What are you looking for

1342
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:57,247
Yeah I mean as I said earlier we really look across vertical so we'll look at everything from Healthcare to robot

1343
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:59,551
RX AR & VR

1344
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,111
Home automation construction tok

1345
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,951
Industry 4.0 the really crossword of goals

1346
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:08,767
We're really looking for passionate entrepreneurs

1347
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:13,631
If we look back at the Sphero example not everyone knows but they started

1348
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:17,471
Their Journey at techstars as a garage door opener

1349
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,775
So we know that products

1350
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:25,919
Come and go and change but the entrepreneurs and the passion is what stays the same so we're just looking for awesome entrepreneurs

1351
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,735
The deadline for techstars iot
