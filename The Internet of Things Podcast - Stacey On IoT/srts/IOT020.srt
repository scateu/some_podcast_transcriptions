00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,264
Hey everyone this is the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,544
Stand this is your

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,080
Stacey Higginbotham

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,616
And your other host

5
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
Kevin tofel

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,224
And we have got a lot of really good stuff for you this week

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,784
So far we've got Google's new router

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,808
Intel

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,088
IDF which is a

10
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,112
It's developers forum

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,928
We got some new findings from some iot startups

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,744
And we have an awesome guest talking about

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
How

14
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,536
Enterprises

15
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,632
We'll be able to like take advantage of the Internet of Things

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,168
So with that

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,216
Let's get it started

18
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:48,128
Let's Get It Started actually Google got it started and we talked about this possibility in the past and now it is real

19
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,712
Google has a brand new wifi router

20
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,064
Which of course everybody has a Wi-Fi router or two or three Vanessa pose in their home

21
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,368
So this is the onhub and what

22
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,648
Makes this different

23
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,672
Couple things actually

24
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,464
This is actually supposed to be

25
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,072
Put out there not hidden away in a closet or data center

26
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
Don't room or whatever

27
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,168
This actually looks like a nice router make

28
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:11,936
Do you have a date

29
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
Bats entering your house

30
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,288
I can neither confirm nor deny a Datacenter Nore safer

31
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,056
Excellent

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,384
Will you know what I mean some people

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,224
Crazy little mediacenter closets and such were they have all the servers for

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,992
Stuff

35
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,784
That's where the router is and also

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,856
Well that's no good because you don't want these Wireless signals to be

37
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,208
In the corner of a house in closed room with walls for the signals to pass through

38
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,512
This actually looks like a nice little

39
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,584
Gadget or Appliance and I know there's a difference between the two

40
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,656
It's a nice-looking router doesn't look like a router I guess it's

41
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
Probably the best way to say it

42
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
The onhub

43
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,568
The other thing is supposed to do is not to look pretty but also its

44
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,104
Should be simple to use

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,224
It's a bad end Google has a little application course there's an app for everything

46
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,552
And the app is good for Android and iOS

47
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,856
So that way you can configure your router or you can

48
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,672
Check the status of it and so on

49
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:09,792
There's I think like a dozen or maybe even 13 and 10 is in there and

50
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,840
One of them is constantly checking

51
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,144
For your network quality and what the

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
The ratchet does the onhub

53
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,472
Lashley

54
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
Several other routers on the market but

55
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,336
What it will do it will change the channels and provide

56
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,128
You look like a quality of service

57
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,968
Certain types of traffic so maybe you're watching video and you want to make sure

58
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
That you're

59
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,576
2160p stream from Netflix is working good

60
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,368
You know the onhub can help with that

61
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,208
That's the tie level but at a lower level

62
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,256
What is this have to do with iot and

63
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,280
Stacy I think

64
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,072
You might have said this in the past

65
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
Maybe there's going to be a router that

66
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,728
Will support natively like brillo and weave and all that stuff for IRT from Google

67
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
Will gas so

68
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
Back in the day

69
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
There's actually two reason

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
One is religious

71
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
The most obvious

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
Which is that there's a lot more devices

73
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
What's with the internet

74
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
And when you have more devices

75
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
Your network is just inherently more

76
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,112
And

77
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:11,744
When you're sticking something that stationary on your wall or on your door that's going to rely on Wi-Fi

78
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,280
You're actually going to

79
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,352
Since you can't move it to find like the best quarter in your house

80
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
To get Wi-Fi reception for that thing

81
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,704
You need the best wifi all over your house

82
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,264
So having a really good

83
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
Browder

84
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,616
Impossible even more access points is really cool

85
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
The other thing is

86
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
Being able to prioritize is just

87
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,040
I don't know I just think it's so essential

88
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,088
Especially like if your

89
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,184
I just think the more devices you have the more you need Tennessee's enterprise-class

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
But

91
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
Sexy stuff

92
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,560
We did talk about Brillo

93
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
Specifically

94
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
As kind of a

95
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,936
A real time operating system for The Internet of Things

96
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
The Google was talking about

97
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
Putting inside

98
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
Routers

99
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
In

100
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,688
We still don't understand how this is actually going to work but the idea was that

101
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
It would have some sort of Hub device

102
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
That would kind of talk to other devices on the Note

103
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
And how to control them in

104
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,440
Onhub could be that device

105
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,815
Right now the Amazon Echo actually is the brains of my smart home

106
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
In many ways

107
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,167
So it is not crazy to think

108
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
That a router could also be the brand

109
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Smart Home

110
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
Especially

111
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
If it did more than

112
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,151
Well this actually does because it supports Bluetooth as well

113
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,223
Once you start supporting Bluetooth

114
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Then

115
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,343
This could act as kind of those Bridge devices for things like

116
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,463
The August door lock that doesn't have Wi-Fi built in but you want to give it that keep

117
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Ability

118
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,839
And you don't kiss again a lot of these devices that are Bluetooth only

119
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,167
That you want to add that remote connectivity that Wi-Fi get you

120
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
They sell these

121
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,727
Extra

122
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,799
Plugin WiFi Bridges is kind of what they're called

123
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
In

124
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
I think I've seen about

125
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,919
Four or five of these marketed

126
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,503
Ford locks there's some for sensors

127
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
In the problem with them is

128
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,623
I don't have that many outlets free

129
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
In my house

130
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
And they're very ugly

131
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,047
I'm pretty but you know you only want so many white boxes

132
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
Stick it out of here

133
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,631
So if you can cram all that door router

134
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
My God

135
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
Please do it because

136
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,263
Hey it's one less you know $50 Bridge you have to buy

137
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
One more Outlet to free up

138
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
I'm excited about that

139
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,991
It looks a lot like there is a startup actually doing something sort of sim

140
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
Call the Eero

141
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
It is e e r o

142
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,671
And they're trying to make a beautiful router with awesome kind of

143
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Features

144
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,023
Much like this it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in the router

145
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,351
In doing a lot with software so people do not have to

146
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Become like

147
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
Years in order

148
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
What there

149
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Yay

150
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
So I think this is

151
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,359
Awesome this looks kind of like a reference design or may not

152
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
Quite the out in the market

153
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Dad is fat

154
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
No it's actually available now for 199 99

155
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,319
You can get it now from a couple places

156
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
Direct

157
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,903
From the Google Store from Amazon

158
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
Walmart.com That's only in the US

159
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
Starting today

160
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,583
And it will be on sale in retail stores in the US and Canada in the next few weeks

161
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
So it's

162
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
It's actually available as of

163
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
The show literally today

164
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,519
And there's a follow-up is going to be another one made by a sus

165
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,079
That will also cost 199 so this is

166
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,895
I guess that's kind of where you going with this is a reference design

167
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,967
It seems like there may be a anyways Fleet of these types of

168
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,295
On hubs are not calling and routers are calling at the onhub

169
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
But you'll be able to purchase

170
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,903
Got it okay so yes that's what I'm thinking about 9

171
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,439
I think I was reading about the AC

172
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Made devices

173
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,535
Right later this year they didn't specify when that would be

174
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
That's great cuz you know I forgot tp-link access

175
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
Set my home and I've played with the tp-link cloud management software

176
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
Adidas no bueno

177
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:10,847
You know I talked to Chet Pipkin he was on the show and I talked to him in a brainstorm Tech event

178
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:16,223
And I was asking him I was actually begging him I was like you know you guys bought the Linksys name

179
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
You know what

180
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,783
Bringing back the iconic lie

181
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
Linksys router shaper

182
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,903
Is a cool idea but you know the best thing you could do for the Linksys brand to keep it relevant

183
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
Is introduced some awesome

184
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,815
But consumer-friendly software that does the things people want to do

185
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
Cuz his response was like

186
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,655
If you log into your router you can do a lot of that

187
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,239
Technically he is correct however

188
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,079
And I don't care what brand router you use I've tried most of the major ones

189
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,431
Yes he is correct if you just log into the router you can there's usually web interface

190
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
They're not

191
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,503
Not not

192
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,575
Friendly or easy to use or not intuitive

193
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
Most consumers I think would

194
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,695
Look at half for only be 3/4 the verbage on these

195
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Set up

196
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
Apps and say what

197
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
It does that even mean

198
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
So

199
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:08,191
Your chances are there's a lot of routers that do some similar things to the onhub now you can you can

200
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,311
Specify quality service for video streams and so on and so forth now but you have to know how to do it

201
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,407
So if they've created software that makes it simple it basically says

202
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
Would you like to prioritize your video

203
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,527
Streaming right now I'm going to say yes

204
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
They're not going to know what the other

205
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
Jargon is

206
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,439
No see what I'm looking at this article in wired all about

207
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
The onhub

208
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
Guess what it says

209
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,583
It supports Bluetooth Wi-Fi and Google's new weave language

210
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,935
Which which is designed to help appliances in Connected home devices talk to each other

211
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Yes

212
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,263
So there we go we've got brillo and weave

213
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,407
Presumably brella somewhere in there definitely we've we still aren't 100% sure what we've is but maybe forget a router in

214
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Start

215
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,967
Start playing around with it we'll figure it out

216
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
Maybe we can figure it out

217
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
All right

218
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Okay

219
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,415
There we go we just spent $200 each

220
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,207
Really one of us

221
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
LOL cancel my order

222
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,327
Cuz I'm currently

223
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
I'm always happy

224
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:16,031
Just out of curiosity how old is your router and what standard or standards does it support

225
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
Oh it's a doe isn't your tooth at 11

226
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
Alcatraz is mine

227
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
So it's

228
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Recent

229
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Enough

230
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,247
I can't tell you what version of mymo it is

231
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
And how

232
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Up-to-date data

233
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,135
That's okay I don't want Rider Envy of yours is better than mine

234
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,559
Cuz I was serious I'd actually I haven't streaming 4K Netflix throughout the house and that the router is in the second floor on

235
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
On one corner of the house

236
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,191
The TV is on the first floor in the far opposite corner of the house

237
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
Your TV should be hardwired

238
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
I don't have any hard wiring in this house of Fortune

239
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
If it's all its

240
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
Is Wi-Fi or nothing in my home so

241
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
And I have to say I have a masseuse it's older it's at ac66u is the model if I recall correctly

242
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
And it was one of the best investments I made

243
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,927
Two years ago whenever it was

244
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,511
Netflix stream 4K working rate and that's with other people

245
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
Using the network in the

246
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
Very

247
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
Perhaps one day we will do it

248
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,471
A total episode dedicated to router subnet

249
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,519
And really like lose every

250
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:27,711
Today is not that day people don't worry we're done go ahead

251
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,295
Is Intel in other big company news is Intel

252
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,111
Right now this week in San Francisco

253
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
Will say across the street from the

254
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Target open

255
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
At home store

256
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,327
Intel developer forum

257
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
Which is

258
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Big

259
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,399
Great show

260
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Today or Tuesday

261
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
Intel CEO

262
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
Did the keto

263
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Which was

264
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
Surprisingly

265
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
All about the internet

266
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:01,247
It's not surprising Because The Internet of Things is like the hottest thing since sliced bread but it was surprising because Intel didn't actually

267
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,831
Can't talk about any data centers he didn't talk about

268
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,927
Any of the new light chips for workstations or laptops or servers

269
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,231
I'm not surprised I mean that's

270
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
That's not sexy in 2015 you know I mean I know that's important those chips are very important Data Center

271
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
Obviously important

272
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
Considers is Fort

273
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
Billion dollars

274
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,567
Alright so it's important to the capital i

275
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,663
With but the point is what's up incoming and

276
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,223
Obviously we know because we talked about it every week

277
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,015
And Intel has

278
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,367
Been late to Market when terms of mobile for example

279
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,975
And they don't repeat that when it comes to IRT and that's why it's the S this year

280
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
That was a big part of their

281
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
They're keynote as well it wasn't

282
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,119
It wasn't those data center chips and graphic chips

283
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,191
And so on and so forth in the newest core chips for PCs

284
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
They were really showing off skin

285
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
Iot wearables and stuff like that so

286
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,847
Wasn't surprised that's what I mean

287
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Okay and

288
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,919
So from a chip perspective

289
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,991
Really what we saw it was something they introduced in

290
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,087
That's it yes but when they introduced NCS it was a concept

291
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
Yes

292
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
And

293
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
Inside it had a

294
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
Arm chip

295
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
I said it out loud

296
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:20,351
What was a concept I don't I don't fault them for what happened for folks who missed it they were showing off I don't recall

297
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
It was like a

298
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,519
Headphones that could measure your heart rate or something to that effect was something with their wearables division it was Prototype

299
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,919
And we later found out that even though they were talking about their own stuff all the time it had an arm chip in that particular probably because their chip

300
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,711
It wasn't quite ready for this

301
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,527
I don't fault them for that but it was a big brouhaha the time

302
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
So

303
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Now

304
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,135
Several months later they have

305
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
It's called the Curie module

306
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
And this is a module

307
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
It's a whole pack

308
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
Which has the

309
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,423
Work which is their kind of tiny low-power small

310
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
It's a 32-bit

311
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
Chip

312
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
So the courtship

313
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,567
It's got 384

314
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
Kill the Lights

315
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
A flash memory

316
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,895
And it has a

317
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
DSP sensor hub chip

318
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,807
Bluetooth low-energy radio a 6 axis accelerometer and gyroscope

319
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
And

320
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,391
Battery charging stuff

321
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,207
Like I'm Epi Macon it basically which is a battery charging

322
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,279
Capabilities so it can be plugged in if you can charge it

323
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,095
So this little module is about the size of

324
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
Thumbnail

325
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Little bit

326
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
It's hard to tell

327
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,751
So it's really tiny and they showed it

328
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
At the the

329
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
Keynote speech

330
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
Integrated into handlebars

331
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Cuda BMX bike

332
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
Language of course

333
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
Was on stage doing

334
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,247
Crazy tricks because you know

335
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,551
You can't have an event like this without welding

336
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,879
So that security platform

337
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,439
And it runs a lot of different

338
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
Soccer kits at Intel calls.the Intel IQ software kit

339
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
It's there's things about identity

340
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
There's things about time to do

341
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
Pills with scheduling

342
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
There's a bunch of them

343
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
There's Fitness ones like

344
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
It's kind of the answer to

345
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Healthkit

346
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
It's more like

347
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,359
We give you give us a bunch of data and

348
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,943
These IQ systems run algorithms on them and pop out like

349
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,503
Useful answers are useful information

350
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,599
I'm and they're designed to do it like in a very small kind of

351
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
Computer memory

352
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,975
That is what Intel's that's kind of the Practical platform

353
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
And

354
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
Keto at the actual event

355
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,863
They should have some cool stuff like

356
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,703
A little clip that you can stick on your baby's car seat that you know when you

357
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
Can you put them in the car seat

358
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,079
It won't allow you to walk away from the car seat without the baby

359
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,407
You know what's nice for not leaving your baby in the car seat

360
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,271
And you know people were I I was I was on the Engadget live blog for a moment they were

361
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
Who does that

362
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
So it happened sadist people

363
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,695
If you could pay that have that not happen to you

364
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
I guarantee you you would pay to not have

365
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
So silly

366
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,447
So there's there's cool things like that there's the date of you know for the bike handles or other athletic equipment from the tree platform

367
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,567
You know so with Intel idea of things lot of flashlights of in no devices

368
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
Lot of wearables lot of I

369
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,687
Coyote which parintele actually are two separate divisions

370
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,735
I still don't know why

371
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Maybe one day we'll

372
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,599
So that's what that was

373
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,695
At this point I mean the Kure even though they announced it was coming

374
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,095
When they discussed it back in January this is really I guess Carrie is coming out party so there's no actual products as of yet that use it

375
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
Don't

376
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
I don't I don't know how

377
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
I don't know of any it's

378
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
It hasn't know it hasn't been a

379
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
Approved by the FDA

380
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
Absolute Radio

381
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
You can't have it in a product

382
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
And Intel.

383
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Seem to me

384
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
I don't think so

385
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
That's about their Style

386
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,695
So yeah so we should be looking for until

387
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,279
To really kind of get into the consumer iot a little bit more which is

388
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
Well

389
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,143
That's kind of leads to an interesting question you know

390
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,239
What Intel needs now that has a chip and a software platform for it

391
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
Who's going to partner with Intel

392
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
So that they showed off Google

393
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
They should have some

394
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,223
Some real time audio kind of stuff with Google

395
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
The Shootist

396
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,551
Project Tango which is Google's 3D

397
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,855
3D imaging

398
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:31,487
Yeah I said it's a developer kit right now it's a tablet with them a bunch of sensors so that way you can literally

399
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,303
Get a 3D map of a room or object

400
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,703
Using his tablet and Intel has their own software called realsense which uses depth sensors of the Dell

401
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,263
Android tablet if it which one exactly it is

402
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,823
Uses Intel's depth-sensing I'd heard that those two

403
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
Supercuts

404
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
Working together now.

405
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
Realsense and Tango

406
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,967
Yes and they showed that off at the Keynote

407
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,527
And they use the word sense of occasionally

408
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,319
Which meaning

409
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Shutters

410
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Shutters

411
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
No no no

412
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,231
So that's that's not Curie that's their the real Sin

413
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Monster

414
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Yassi

415
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
I'm just thinking

416
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,375
Again having seen until get

417
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,679
Essentially demolishing the mobile market by

418
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,959
Arm processors

419
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,031
People have so much people I should say that

420
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,335
Company's product companies have so much

421
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,663
Time and money and effort invested in the arm

422
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Platform

423
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:29,343
That I wonder if they're still going to be a struggle for until to get a foothold in the wearable Market

424
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,647
Now intel did show off

425
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,207
What they said was an Intel powered

426
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
Android Wear smart

427
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Watch

428
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
That was made by father

429
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:44,191
Interesting Yokai fossils of the late to the game on Android Wear but that's okay

430
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,727
And so

431
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
All we know about it

432
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Is that it's going to run an inn

433
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
And that is all

434
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:56,735
I'm going to suspect that's probably not curious while I'm going to say that's a small Adam but we will see

435
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
It is a small

436
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,879
Yeah that makes more sense cuz it that I know what kind of phones they need in the Android Wear watches

437
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,487
Good luck in telxon minutes

438
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
What you know

439
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,559
Again I never bet

440
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,631
I don't know until because they have marketing they have

441
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,679
They can buy stuff if they were

442
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:22,079
Taking subsidized stuff I mean that's what happens with the low-cost Windows laptops you know that that's why they're cheaper than Chrome

443
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
Looks with your running arm chips

444
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,919
You know Intel is putting their atoms in

445
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
Tablets

446
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,271
Laptops and paying the the hardware vendors to do so

447
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
So I

448
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,879
I don't know and you know they bought basis which is one of the best

449
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,183
Hardcore Fitness Mark Hour Fitness

450
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
Activity trackers out there

451
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
A lot of people

452
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,791
I agree I wouldn't bet against a migraine

453
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
So we'll see

454
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
Little short bits of news

455
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,423
I'll send a big companies on the startup front

456
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,775
Filament which is a company that I have loved forever because it

457
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,847
Combines two crazy things which is the Internet of Things

458
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
End

459
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,639
Blockchain

460
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,199
Transaction database behind

461
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
Bitcoin

462
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
So

463
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,319
This company has raised $5000000

464
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,367
And has come out with its

465
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
Core product which is a

466
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Ruggedized

467
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Sensor

468
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
And in Bacolod

469
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
Tap

470
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
In the network

471
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,631
Kind of architecture the taplerun on

472
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,471
And the network architecture is basically a technology stack

473
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
Around blockchain

474
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,567
So it's going to have blockchain for

475
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
They kind of distributed database

476
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
It has

477
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:32,223
BitTorrent for distributed file sharing among all the sensors in the network

478
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
It has a

479
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
Mesh radio technology called

480
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
T mesh

481
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:42,719
Which is really cool it can go 9 miles and has incredibly low data rate

482
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
It's like

483
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,279
300 kg

484
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,119
Minutes like might be the first dial-up modem my head

485
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
In the 90s

486
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
Actually sorry

487
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
It's really slow but

488
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,615
But it would be for

489
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
Small amounts of data

490
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
Diverging from devices

491
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,271
Is this sensor on is this soil

492
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Fred dry

493
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,367
Yes basically Boolean type on off

494
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Pets

495
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,463
So is Elsa runs Tallahassee

496
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,535
Which is a private messaging service so that's

497
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
How these things are going to

498
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
Communicate

499
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
And

500
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,423
I feel like there's one more thing that I'm forgetting in here

501
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,495
The authentication software

502
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
Oh say can you see

503
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,175
Which is apparently that's the contract kind of

504
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
Authentication software

505
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:40,575
And it is used it's an ietf standard and it is used in a watt

506
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:45,951
You may be familiar with a lot because anytime you sign into something using Facebook or Twitter IDs

507
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
On the web

508
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,767
That is a lot basically

509
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
So

510
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
That is

511
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,631
That's the network stack that they've built

512
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,703
It's a really compelling idea because

513
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,239
Tidy is compelling because it's

514
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
A decentralized kind of

515
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Coyote

516
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Internet

517
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,151
The reason that school is because if you're somewhere in the middle of nowhere

518
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,711
And you don't have like the internet connectivity

519
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:14,111
This allows your devices to actually you give them a piece of information or a contract and they can just keep

520
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,159
Running off of that until you update it

521
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,440
So until like

522
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
If your

523
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,488
Your farmer in a field

524
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
Until you drive out the next time with you

525
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
Your phone

526
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Or a satellite phone if

527
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
If you're going out

528
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
Middle of truly nowhere

529
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
You know you can

530
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:34,080
Update with that connectivity like on a one-time basis every week or every month or every year

531
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
You know when and then

532
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
Pick up the information

533
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
Distributed

534
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,992
Price of it so the data will actually be stored

535
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,808
In devices until there's a connection available

536
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
Texted get it and or

537
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
Send receive

538
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
Yes

539
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
So it's good for

540
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,024
Crazy remote places it's also good for

541
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,608
Security because there are places where you want to have

542
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,400
Troll you don't want things always on the air

543
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
So this

544
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,984
Highly secure device

545
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
Gather data from it

546
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
Again same concept

547
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
And it's

548
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
Cheaper

549
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,968
Then having like a centralized Cloud Server that you know

550
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:17,600
Maybe you don't want to pay for that for 15 years or 20 years or however long you

551
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,416
Plan to have a mining operation in the middle of the Australian Outback

552
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,976
And maybe that's Overkill anyway

553
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
So that kind of Deeds

554
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,048
That's the market they're going out

555
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,328
After so it's not the same

556
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,424
Normal Market that we talked about a lot but it's a really interesting idea

557
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
They are not crazy

558
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,008
In the sense that they're not alone

559
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,848
IBM and Samsung are also testing the concept of

560
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,384
Using the blockchain

561
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,968
They're actually using ethereums network I believe

562
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,296
Where is these guys are using bitcoin's blockchain

563
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
Technology

564
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,624
For those of you guys who are like

565
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
What the what

566
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
It's basically a difference

567
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,512
It's a difference in how they

568
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Cryptocurrency

569
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,912
But yeah so I'm really excited about them I

570
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
Wish them luck and

571
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,472
$5000000 is

572
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,288
It's good for them and I can't wait to start hearing from customers

573
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,104
The Beatrice NYC

574
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,152
These things get implemented and see how well they work

575
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
It will be

576
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
It will be

577
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
Crazy interesting

578
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,528
Because I love having multiple models of thing

579
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,112
A b testing in the real world Network architectures

580
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,928
Alright final thing

581
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
Ring

582
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,536
We talked about it before they make a connected video doorbell weave

583
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Tried it out

584
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:35,680
They also received funding they receive 28 million in a round that was led by

585
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,216
Sir Richard Branson

586
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,264
You may have heard of him

587
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
I have

588
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,080
They're not changing their name to the

589
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
Nigel

590
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
I would expect them to

591
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,968
It's a shame

592
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,040
So that's just if you have a ring or yours

593
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,320
Sitting on the fence going

594
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
Which doorbell should I buy

595
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,160
I don't know which company will go out of business first

596
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,000
Maybe you're not as cynical as I am

597
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,816
I know

598
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:07,424
But they make a good price I think there I feel safe buying something from them

599
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
Aunt

600
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
Their CEO was

601
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,288
It's really smart in that earlier on they made

602
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,080
Product that wasn't a good product

603
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:20,992
You know I asked him about it he's like you know we realize that we really needed to focus because we compete against

604
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,576
We don't compete against other video doorbell

605
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,696
Today's when you hit the mainstream consumer market for your product you're competing against Apple and Samsung

606
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,304
And if you're asking the consumer to pay $200 for device

607
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,352
That's who they're going to compare you again

608
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:41,984
Yeah it's interesting how certain brands have set up a price expectation

609
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,312
When you are at lesser no name and then

610
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,872
Nothing is wrong but I don't think most people would

611
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,432
Recognize their name or the product just yet

612
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:54,016
Yeah you're going to be compared to the apples the same songs and so on so

613
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,088
It's almost unfair but unfortunately the reality of it

614
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
So

615
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,184
I think that's probably all we have time for

616
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
For today

617
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488

00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,896

I'm doing so well I am really excited to have you on the show

637
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
People around the world

638
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,904
On what other companies are doing in the internet.

639
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
Space

640
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,256
Delta flight 795 of them

641
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,096
Completed the survey in Seoul right today between the answers

642
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,680
All the questions and that is what we took for analysis

643
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:18,240
And definitely

644
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
Seesaw

645
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:25,408
And yeah I was actually kind of stunned so what you guys found was that

646
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,736
80% of companies were already

647
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,808
Deploying internet of things kind of projects

648
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
And something

649
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,648
They're spending a lot of money

650
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,232
It's ugly and infect the quite a surprise

651
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,072
The fact that in a photo flight companies that actually

652
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
Do we sing something on the Internet of Things

653
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Mainstays

654
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,704
And also the impact.

655
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,824
Example about the companies

656
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,920
Family departs another company

657
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,944
Project

658
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,784
Increase by 16%

659
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,344
In the areas where they are using

660
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,136
Which is really big

661
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,952
I'm sorry their revenue increased by

662
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,256
16% so16

663
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
On average

664
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:20,192
And then grows about a small group of companies about other companies

665
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,520
Increase of 30%

666
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
WWE

667
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
Initiative

668
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:32,224
Did you think about the revenue increases one of the biggest challenges that companies face

669
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,272
Because of intense competition

670
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Flea markets

671
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,832
I'm at the same time

672
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856
The cost

673
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,416
Prediction Cassidy's tomorrow

674
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,464
Maximum potential

675
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,864
So Cal Gas Company Springfield Avenue

676
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,192
Biggest caught up in what we call the volleyball

677
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:59,104
And I want this seems to be an important tool that is helping these companies break through that Valley boundary body

678
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,176
So the concept of the value boundary

679
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
Is what

680
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
It is that

681
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,552
Increase your Revenue substantially

682
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,856
And you cannot also reduce your costs

683
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Density

684
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,976
Because most of the costly was I've been up late in the last 10 to 15 years

685
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,256
Then you're not

686
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,328
Distance to be able to increase the value of 40

687
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:23,680
Companies are really looking at

688
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,544
And what you're seeing on the ground is that

689
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,080
Help them accomplish

690
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
Brasier report

691
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
I was really struck

692
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,456
I was trapped by the numbers

693
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,784
Because they are actually really significant and

694
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
I'm not hearing

695
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,136
A lot of the companies that I talk to

696
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
They are looking at

697
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
The industrial internet

698
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,072
Looking at this is a way to do kind of

699
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,400
Our return-on-investment so a lot of the times

700
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,472
They're kind of doing sandbox trial projects

701
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
The kind of

702
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,544
Become a little bit more efficient

703
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,640
They aren't looking at it is a kind of severely innovative

704
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,432
Play right off the bat

705
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:09,504
And despite what HE tells me in their press release

706
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
So

707
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,368
This next part of the report I really loved and

708
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,464
You had a whole section that the entire back chunk of your report

709
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
Talked about like

710
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,072
Highly successful iot leaders

711
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
And

712
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,168
You know I was I would love for you to tell me like

713
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
First off

714
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,544
What are some of the companies that you classified as some of these iot leader

715
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
Report

716
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
Damn.

717
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,736
30% or more of Revenue in

718
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
So

719
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,624
These are companies that are actually seeing

720
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
Substantial

721
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,792
And this is not just related to the amount of spending that they do

722
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
But really

723
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,680
David shining as the leader

724
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,008
And the thing to find out what exactly are they doing

725
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,800
Differently or what is common

726
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
Among all these companies

727
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
Thanks

728
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,760
What are the key observations that we have is that what the last

729
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,296
7 or 8 years

730
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:20,928
Did audible the five important digital technologies that are coming into play

731
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,000
Angry call about the digital 5 forces

732
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,072
The first one is about mobility and pervasive computing

733
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,864
Second one to support Big Data

734
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,168
Good things about social media

735
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
Fortis stock

736
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,496
Insist on this machine learning

737
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520
Intelligent

738
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
And this

739
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:42,176
Flight technology so it won't go any faster

740
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,016
And internet of things happens to be what we call of the composite

741
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,832
Because the class combinations of all these things

742
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,928
And in fact one of the only composite Falls that has all different elements

743
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,952
Yeah but it didn't work

744
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,328
And the net result of this composite for The Internet of Things is doing the companies

745
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,912
Is giving them an opportunity to completely re-imagined

746
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
Themselves

747
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,008
And I'll be calling cuz digital remaster Nation

748
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,104
And it's interesting seems to be important.

749
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,152
Angelina's

750
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
Before

751
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,200
We're actually going

752
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,992
Computer

753
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,344
First one is about creating and telling your business model

754
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,160
Second it's about creating and telling you products

755
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,952
Conservative that never existed before

756
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,328
And third one was about creeping customer segments in babies that was never done before

757
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,192
And the fourth one is about creating entirely new channels of distribution of their products

758
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,288
And the first one is about creating and telling your business processes

759
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,080
Complete remodeling

760
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,360
What they had before

761
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,992
And what you found that as a common theme

762
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,040
Accomplish

763
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:54,112
The 30% increase in Revenue Andre Ward initiative

764
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,440
Was that did not looking at a tactical rail

765
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,512
Port Canaveral transfer meteor imaginative

766
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,096
Ended up going and impacting all the six areas that I talked about

767
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,888
And that was one important thing

768
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,776
Okay wow you just gave us a whole lot you gave us

769
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,312
5 kind of

770
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,920
Big trends you gave a six ways that you should be looking it was six ways right that

771
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
They're changing their business

772
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,016
So let's unpack that a little bit

773
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:22,784
Because

774
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
Again

775
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
A lot of stuff there

776
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
Let's take

777
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
Applying Big Data

778
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
Across all of these things

779
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,976
And then let's take how

780
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:34,048
A company might view its Workforce its

781
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,840
Change Iris are changing

782
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,680
Using all of these things to reimagine its Workforce how it interacts

783
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
His customers howitt

784
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,032
How it can be imagined it's business

785
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,360
And let's let's talk about how one of your leaders is doing

786
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
Short so

787
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
Take the kids of

788
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,480
A leader and

789
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,808
Let's talk about the six areas from business model

790
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,600
Products and services

791
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,880
Customer segments

792
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,512
The business part of the business model

793
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
Engine types of business model

794
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,888
Changing a business model is extremely clogged

795
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,216
But if you can make the change happen.

796
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,544
And if someone took advantage of Auto industry that is competing in

797
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
Coyotes

798
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,384
Helping them do that important

799
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,224
Inductive by creating watercolors data transparency

800
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,088
So the ability of a manufacturer to Caribou Sublimity into

801
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,440
Hold the product of the creator

802
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,000
What does a jet engine used to being

803
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,792
Is performing at is being used

804
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,888
That's created the opportunity to intelligence the business model from

805
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:46,240
Capital expense business model tomorrow for an operating expense

806
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,592
People in industrial talking about the hole

807
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
Jefferson Industries

808
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:52,896
It's moving from

809
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,224
Selling engines for millions of dollars

810
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
Who actually selling Plus

811
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
Customer service

812
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:03,648
Soda dungeon

813
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,464
Or take the case of insurance companies

814
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
Insurance companies

815
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,328
Google play classic edition

816
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Red Sox

817
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,144
You could have done then

818
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,448
They have a fuel classifications of drivers

819
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
Discipline

820
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,264
Characteristics

821
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,848
And then they determine the premium based upon which segment.

822
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,384
I know you are not sending it

823
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,456
But that is not the optimal

824
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,784
Because for example some segments like a team segment

825
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,832
Are considered as bad drivers

826
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
From the get-go

827
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:37,184
And even if somebody is a good driver he does not get rewarded for

828
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,256
Winston August

829
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,840
Transparency for example vehicle to one of the

830
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,400
Insurance companies in North America theater system

831
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,472
Where do you use the sensors on the mobile phone

832
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,264
Telematic device

833
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,848
And that system intern talks to the Big Data System

834
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,200
And this data last message. Driving the cell phone tracks

835
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:03,040
Though you're driving too fast.

836
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
Song

837
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:08,416
Or are you driving at the weather conditions Changed by combining data from

838
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,256
The telematics device the mobile phone with the data from

839
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,304
But that sources for example

840
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
Anthony

841
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,888
Creative or I could just profile of the individual

842
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,984
So that no the premium can be determined at the individual level

843
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,056
So that's a fundamental difference.

844
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,080
It makes sometimes

845
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,104
Business model

846
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:32,736
Got it makes a lot of sense now I talked to some companies that are trying to introduce these swords

847
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
What's a business model

848
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,576
What they've run into though

849
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,368
Is it the middle men

850
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,160
Or their distribution Network

851
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,720
Makes that sort of change

852
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
A challenge

853
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
They

854
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,840
Don't want to be cut out or maybe they don't want to

855
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,376
Sell that new model

856
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,192
I think what's

857
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,776
Most interesting about this shift is company C

858
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:00,384
That the business model needs to change they try to make it happen

859
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
And then what

860
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,480
Define inertia in their distribution chain

861
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:07,808
And maybe they're like a home and now I have to remake Midas

862
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,832
Houston chain

863
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,112
Or they're like I have to

864
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
Condense

865
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,416
In a whole new layer of

866
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,488
People that I've never had to work with before to work with me

867
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:20,864
It really is an ecosystem play and it seems like the whole ecosystem is it quite

868
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
There yet

869
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,960
I completely agree with you.

870
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,520
Iot using ecosystem play 1G

871
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
From the

872
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:35,200
There's no one single player who is going to dominate

873
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,528
I'd like plants when we actually go in 30 employment

874
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,552
Play one

875
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:44,928
Fieldpointe dual-channel tens on his credit card and the companies do need to

876
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,000
CVS of taking the channel along with them

877
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,840
Seventeen.com

878
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,984
We brought about lot of difficulty Santos Tunisia

879
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,848
But if there is substantial value that is being delivered

880
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,152
The customer will come through the change

881
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,456
Rachel Noble

882
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,272
Doesn't listen W have from the internet Revolution

883
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:14,368
And I would say that the Internet of Things Revolution

884
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,648
Fuel Moto

885
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,720
Because the Internet Revolution was all about

886
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,280
The digital replacing II

887
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:25,120
But Internet of Things is all about the digitally enhancing.

888
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888
Right

889
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,168
So in many ways

890
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,360
I'm very important question example one of the most inspiring example

891
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:39,712
I think about is the HP instant ink program

892
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,296
Ink by themselves

893
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,904
So you think about it the whole.com Revolution was

894
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,464
Basilic got replaced by a machine

895
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,512
But now the budget is a mission

896
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
Right so

897
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,352
There's no intention of a human being from a buying site

898
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,168
That's a really astute observation

899
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,216
And kind of scary

900
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
The fire is a machine

901
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,080
The seller is a machine so where do people fit in

902
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,296
It has created so much of value.

903
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,624
Even if I get replaced by a buyer let's take that example

904
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,768
The printer Arlington ink in creating value for me or not

905
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,656
I'm not emotionally attached to the fact that you know I could go on and Order

906
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,264
Oregon and order return online on my webpage

907
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,872
But the fact that the printer is detecting it is running low on

908
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,176
And automatically ordering it

909
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
Everything gets delivered to my doorstep

910
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,528
And I don't get into

911
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,648
Ganges Restaurant

912
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:55,232
What time of day it is

913
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,536
So

914
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
What is that

915
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,352
Does cryptic summative value

916
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:05,216
For all people in the value chain that people will go along with the change

917
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,752
In a positive frame of mind

918
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
And I

919
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
Physical exam

920
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,336
Okay I agree with you

921
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:15,712
Probably even the people who are responsible for ordering ink it companies would rather spend their time ordering

922
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,272
I don't know anything but ink

923
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,600
So let's dig into a couple things so we talked

924
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,880
Some about kind of

925
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
You would offered these seven

926
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,720
Tenant 7 things that the

927
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,000
The leaders did

928
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,280
I'm in

929
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,304
We we talked

930
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,888
I hear you're a big guy for numbers and lists I'm sensing

931
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,216
You know you're at your five big shifts your six

932
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,544
You're six things companies can realize

933
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
So

934
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,848
The first thing went

935
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:46,944
Was literally iot leaders are more likely to reimagine their businesses in

936
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:52,064
Produce substantial values for customers not just values for themselves

937
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,600
And we kind of talked about

938
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:58,464
Second they deliver that value through new business models products and service offering

939
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
We talked about that

940
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:06,656
Third they appear more likely to see the Breakthrough potential of iot getting the ultimate truth on how their products and services

941
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:10,240
They're performing for customers as well as the actual usage patterns

942
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,312
I think we actually probably should dig into that

943
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,128
Actually one of the

944
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,688
Great benefits of iot and I think

945
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,552
I want to hear some sleep anxiety to product development

946
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,880
So the traditional software product development

947
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,464
I want a big change because now you can actually

948
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
So you can

949
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,424
And you can use that $2

950
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,960
The next version of the Torah

951
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
And make

952
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,776
Lord of incremental

953
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,056
Industry

954
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
Talk to the digital

955
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,664
So that was a big thing that happened with the last

956
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,504
YouTube videos of analytics on software products

957
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,344
But now I want is actually golden Abel.

958
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:01,440
And then to something is sometimes what you hear back

959
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,744
Something machines may not exactly be what

960
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
You want

961
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,840
Company is coming

962
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,936
Many times to hear things that are not exactly what

963
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
Catolica

964
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
So how do you react to that

965
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
Got it

966
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:21,408
And so that that covers those kind of stories cover your fourth and fifth points which are the

967
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,688
Iot leaders

968
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:27,552
They organized themselves to act rapidly based on this performance and customer usage data

969
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,600
And they're just stay

970
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,184
Get better at dealing with internal resistance to hearing the truth about their toy

971
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,464
So

972
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,536
People ask for this button they must love it and then no one ever

973
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,304
Press that button

974
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,608
That's a hard truth

975
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,680
Or people really hate your product

976
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
That's a really hard

977
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,984
R-Truth

978
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:50,592
They make six I thought was great they may coyote reliable in the field

979
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,384
Especially reducing risks

980
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,919
Cyber security breaches

981
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:57,247
I think a lot of companies right now are still falling down

982
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,783
About that I'll be honest

983
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,855
I've noticed a lot of blaming the customer

984
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
About that

985
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,183
Or just outright ignoring it

986
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:10,303
And 7th they make small test investments before making broader and bigger one

987
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
I think

988
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
That last one is

989
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
Explain

990
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,983
You know if we want to end this with a sense of kind of

991
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,543
Security what is your advice to customer

992
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,335
As they're considering

993
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,615
Either

994
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,687
Connecting their own manufacturing or their own

995
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,783
Internal operations or if they're planning on making a

996
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Product

997
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,087
Where do you think

998
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,671
They are when it comes to security what are the conversations they're having

999
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:41,279
2 IU is this point of security

1000
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,071
Primarily because

1001
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,607
Implications of the phone

1002
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,911
And the computer

1003
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:52,031
So the text

1004
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,871
But good internet of things you're going to impact something in the physical world

1005
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:01,503
So think about the impact of something happening to a jet engine burn this life is my dad

1006
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:05,087
Or you are going full speed in the expressway and something happened

1007
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,671
To the car because security please

1008
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:14,047
AllMusic tonight what is system in your home and you talked everything was Secure

1009
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:18,911
And then someone please play security and now they can actually deactivate

1010
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:22,751
The Simpsons

1011
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,079
So the implications of security office

1012
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:26,847
Full

1013
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,383
Performance

1014
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,407
And I

1015
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:33,759
I do think that it does not fully appreciated yet in its full magnitude

1016
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,855
But the lot of the good Solutions providers that the worker

1017
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,135
You know what

1018
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:44,511
Are taking notice and solutions.

1019
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:48,351
And the systems that you put together has security as one of the foremost

1020
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,143
Things that about

1021
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
Simply because

1022
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,215
What are the implications of a beach

1023
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:57,567
On what system that is operating in the physical world is just simply too big

1024
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,639
Got it all right

1025
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:05,759
Such a thank you so much for coming on the podcast today I really appreciate having

1026
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,551
This kind of in-depth conversation

1027
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
About

1028
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
How

1029
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,391
Companies can be successful

1030
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:17,023
In the playing kind of iot in both their products and hopefully in their own operations

1031
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,447
A Blog and I think so too great to talk to you in person

1032
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,263
Awesome thank you

1033
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,567
And that concludes our show

1034
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:34,943
Thanks for listening this week will be back next week with more iot goodness
