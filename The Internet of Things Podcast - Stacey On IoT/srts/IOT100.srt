Apus

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,856
You know we did some digging and

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
We've been doing this a long time

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,160
We have we've

11
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,464
In fact

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,256
We'll insert right here

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,816
An example of our Show from

14
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,096
2 years ago

15
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:40,192
It's one of the last shows when we were the gigaom Internet of Things

16
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
Podcast

17
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,240
Take a moment

18
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,176
Hey everybody is Stacey Higginbotham

19
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,904
Good afternoon we should probably start by just getting it out of the way

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,208
No I haven't installed to resole the insteon system

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,256
So it's like you knew I was going to ask

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,912
It's true I like the worst most horrendous bag

23
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,520
Kitchen makeover going on

24
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
Are some kinds of

25
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
Craziness

26
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
All right

27
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,896
But now back to the present

28
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,040
We've got an arm report

29
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,576
We've got LTE

30
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,856
For The Internet of Things

31
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,416
We got things to see at mwc

32
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,024
We're going to talk about the problem with all female personal assistant

33
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,096
Maybe some Google home shopping

34
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,168
Connected lines with something

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,288
I also going to talk to you about my experience with orbi router because people

36
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,224
After all this we've got a message from our sponsor spin dance talking about voice interface

37
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
And

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,552
After that we have our guest

39
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,624
Who is the CEO of a company called venteon

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
Talking about the internet of moving

41
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
But wait

42
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,816
There's more here's a message from one of our sponsors

43
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,656
The Network's is an Enterprise internet-of-things platform that is empowering the world

That's a y l a

52
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
Well he excited

53
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
You said

54
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,296
It's something kind of music

55
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,856
It's not really on her show notes

56
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
But I have to say that

57
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
Celebration of our hundred episode

58
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
I bought my wife a gift

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
Actions for Valentine's Day but it works either way

60
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
And it arrives

61
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
Just yesterday actually

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,728
And she said it up this morning while I was still asleep

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
And

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
Something kind of

65
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,128
So I went downstairs this morning for the show before the show

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,688
I put two Toaster Strudels in there

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,248
Oh so bad but oh so good at the same time

68
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,832
And of course the June oven recognize their Toaster Strudels and

69
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
Coping with your professor

70
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
Better than a toaster does because

71
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,488
Custard never gets the Frozen middle part without burning outside

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Anyway

73
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Point has

74
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
I just

75
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,632
Took them out of the oven and I get a message for my wife

76
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,680
Just like your food is done

77
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
Menchie's

78
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
She's at work right now and this message

79
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,640
Came out of the blue I completely forgot that it's connected to her phone she set the whole thing up

80
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:06,016
But it freaked me out of my is she going to know every time I like cook stuff that I should be eating

81
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Yes

82
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,112
Oh no where's the privacy

83
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,512
If I should mention that June has sponsored the show

84
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
In the past

85
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
What I purchased

86
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,935
I think you could probably turn some of that off

87
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
Vacations

88
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031
But yes Whoever has the app on their phone

89
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
Made it so you can actually

90
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Pair to differ

91
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
To the Jew

92
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,831
We just happen to have a couple of songs in

93
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
12

94
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
Yes Amber Alerts must be

95
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,399
But anyway I just thought it was hysterical.

96
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
Using it for the very first time

97
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,775
Amazon I got a message from my wife right before I take the very first bite

98
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
Am I substitute oh my west side

99
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
Basically I know what you're doing

100
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,175
Eating the forbidden fruit

101
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
Yea High

102
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,599
I asked my husband

103
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Hey

104
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
How's a baked potato

105
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
Kinkos how did he

106
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:26,143
Ice cream so we'll be playing with that obviously for the next

107
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
Couple weeks

108
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
I think we're going to keep it

109
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
Alright so I have

110
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
Moving from the smartphone to the

111
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
Industrial internet

112
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
I have

113
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
An excellent survey that came out

114
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Actually Tuesday

115
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
It's from The Economist and arm

116
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,159
And it's basically an index tracking how businesses are adopting

117
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
As

118
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Little worried about indexes they can

119
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
Compare a time frame now to time frame

120
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,119
At some point in the past

121
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
You're measuring not based on like percentage gains but you're

122
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
Measuring based on

123
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
Games in the App

124
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
Dex from

125
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,567
The time before previous run the Baseline

126
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,359
Yes for the base that's the word

127
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
That's the word

128
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
And

129
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
What they found is

130
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
Companies adopting

131
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,063
The industrial internet-of-things are actually adopted

132
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
Fairly slowly

133
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,135
I'm slower than

134
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
So

135
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
Monastic orders

136
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,559
Surveyed said they strongly agree that their progress has not happened as quickly as expected

137
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,887
And another 33% said they some Whitaker

138
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,471
So only 10% said they disagreed

139
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
That their progress has been

140
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,543
As quickly as expect

141
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
So

142
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
That's one kind of sense

143
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,247
And the survey and it's 825 senior Business Leaders including

144
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
About 400 c-level executives are for

145
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,855
And there around the country

146
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
30% Europe 30%

147
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
America

148
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
30% nature pack

149
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
And the rest

150
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
Everywhere else

151
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,119
It's kind of like a smart home to me

152
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,167
It's going to take time for

153
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,751
All these different possible iot solutions

154
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
Spore Enterprises businesses small businesses Etc

155
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
Chevrolet China

156
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
Consolidate

157
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
A little bit

158
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,223
Has to figure out the business cases

159
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,087
What kind of struck me is they talked about where people were in the process like

160
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,927
Nonexistent in research and planning early implementation

161
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,743
No it was an extensive

162
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
Fermentation occur

163
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Around the world

164
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
Companies went

165
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
From being in research to being

166
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Planning

167
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,799
But in North America that actually went

168
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Down

169
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,431
And that was kind of an odd mix and it could be that people have gone from

170
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,271
There was a lot of companies doing research and then some of them abandoned it

171
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,111
I did think that was an interesting finding

172
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
So

173
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,511
Yeah there's one other aspect all this said that

174
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
I don't think this

175
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,839
Survey really talks about and that is

176
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,191
Instrument things you Bring iot into your business

177
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,031
Are gathering data so that way you can make data-driven Solutions

178
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
Rap that's a lot of data

179
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,151
And I wonder if a lot of these companies are prepared for that that's

180
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,223
An integral part of the research in the planning

181
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,783
What are they going to make a slice and dice

182
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
You know there's so much

183
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,647
Beyond the actual physical iot stuff

184
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
All the data

185
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,255
That what are they doing with that and I think that's a big chunk of their

186
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Time investment

187
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
Why Kevin

188
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
You are right

189
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Because in

190
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,423
Questioning about which parts of their business have seen the greatest positive change

191
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
The iot

192
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
Where is percent said their data

193
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
Analysis

194
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
Pikachu

195
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,807
The other thing to note is the chief obstacles currently

196
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,111
Preventing an organization from using the

197
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,439
30% said it was the high cost of

198
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Investment in

199
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Infrastructure

200
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,279
The next largest

201
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,119
Group was concerned about security and privacy 26%

202
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
Of the respondents

203
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Wer

204
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Worried about

205
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
The next was the lack of Senior Management

206
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Acknowledging

207
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,895
Which shows that this really in in this is true we said this before

208
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
It really does need to

209
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Okay

210
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,551
So this is also a little bit industrial but still very cool

211
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,623
The Internet of Things is getting LTE coverage thanks to

212
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Google and Qualcomm

213
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
And then also

214
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
New chips from Intel

215
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,815
So what happened this week is Intel lodged

216
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,607
It's called its liquid

217
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
Or it's but it's liqd

218
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
Because we're out

219
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
We're running out of owls

220
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
In The Internet of Things

221
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:53,151
And what they done is the cat carrier proof boards which means that you no longer have to if you

222
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
Use one of their boards

223
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,503
You don't have to go to get certification through

224
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
Carrier which is a login

225
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,671
It is probably less for startups

226
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
You could use it but

227
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
It's

228
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,279
It's any company that really just doesn't want to

229
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,839
Get that expertise or learn to deal with all that

230
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
Is it it's a

231
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Process

232
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
The other cool piece of news

233
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
And we should say that

234
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,263
Kevin works for Google right now

235
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:25,407
Right this very second but I do not work on anything I would she related or smart home or anything like that

236
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
Specifically Android phones

237
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
Qualcomm Snapdragon

238
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,599
210 chip will add support for Android things

239
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,159
Later this year which brings it along with the raspberry

240
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,999
Tnxp Pico and the Intel Edison board

241
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,119
This is cool because this is a board that has LTE on it

242
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
Yay

243
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
So Android things now has LTE

244
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:59,199
Yeah I'm curious to see what happens with Android thinks it's a relatively new Initiative for Google Pinkalicious

245
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
A few months ago there was

246
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,039
Rebranded renamed relaunched

247
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,879
But yeah you're right it wants to compete against the Raspberry Pi and other

248
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,927
IRT type boards and all that but

249
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Is Android things

250
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Is actually an

251
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
Olestra

252
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Metastatic

253
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
Gosh what does it mean

254
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
These are boards but they also have

255
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,455
Basically

256
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
Actually would be a

257
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
But but anyways

258
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
I digress

259
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,183
Leadership support for LTE and really help you

260
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,231
Connectivity challenges witch

261
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,279
Obviously is key for iot so

262
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,607
I'm very interested to see what people do with

263
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,471
This chip and his platform later on this year when they can do something with it

264
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
Obviously

265
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Probably

266
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,335
Ideal for things that are not in the home or in

267
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
Things are on the Move Realty

268
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Having a

269
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
Connection anywhere

270
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
Expensive things

271
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Cameras that's a good one

272
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,295
I don't think you'll see it in cars

273
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
There for that but

274
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,279
Bring some little like smartconnect and scooters and such

275
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Dutch oven

276
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
Sweater Segways

277
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
Well what would be really interesting

278
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
Actually is

279
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
Not LTE

280
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
Which gay

281
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,591
But getting something like LTE cat 1M

282
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
Or

283
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
Nb-iot Witcher

284
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,711
Versions of cellular radio

285
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
Cellular standards

286
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
Design for small data

287
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,367
Those chips are just now coming out where to see a bunch of

288
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Congress

289
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
When that happen

290
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
A mad rush to

291
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
Cellular it all kinds of

292
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,423
World Congress

293
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
We got some cool news actually

294
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
Next week

295
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
Is Mobile World Congress

296
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
Congress Kevin is not going

297
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,615
I am not doing

298
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
So so

299
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,015
I found a couple things to look for we've already talked about some of the new network

300
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
The new Chips

301
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
But

302
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,415
There is a blockchain platform

303
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
I'm actually talk to these guys

304
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
A long time ago

305
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
But it's called iota

306
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
And basically

307
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
It is a

308
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,471
It's not a cryptocurrency but it's it's a distributed Ledger

309
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,543
Is going to allow you to

310
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,591
Track stuff that happens at a low

311
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,383
Low power low data rate

312
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:42,527
Kind of slow as soon as a result stand in terms of processing how many transactions per second

313
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
It's interesting that they

314
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,415
Do 7 / 2nd where they say Visa does mm

315
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,767
Some scalability that's got any work out there if it's going to

316
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,303
Really take off I think but

317
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
It's interesting

318
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,887
Yeah so this is things like if I were at mobile world

319
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
Check this out

320
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
And they also the developer

321
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
With nautical

322
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,103
Is canonical has iot core

323
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
OS kind of platform

324
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
So maybe

325
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,039
This is for microvilli

326
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,879
Doing kind of automated contractor charging for things

327
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
Crazy small scale

328
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Tails so

329
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,767
Yeah maybe you're by your washing machine can buy

330
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Detergent

331
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Those kind of things

332
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
Amazing

333
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
That would be nice

334
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,615
Will find a use desperately

335
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,223
And we also saw coming out at

336
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
Mobile World Congress

337
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
A new

338
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,831
Everything

339
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:56,511
But I guess I can understand why they need a new hub for this because this is something called

340
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Tabs

341
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:03,679
That's kind of like a play on keeping tabs on people it's a solution for busy families

342
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,031
And they're using that's the real Laura and that

343
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,383
Wi-Fi and Laura and therefore I can understand why in this instance

344
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
Stay With Me

345
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,759
So they're washing are they

346
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Off

347
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
Bubble Rock on

348
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,879
Okay okay

349
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
And they're doing

350
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
And for those of you guys who

351
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,767
Do not regularly follow the show

352
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
Laura is a low-power

353
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,375
Wide area network so you can send

354
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Small amounts of data

355
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,215
Fairly cheaply over really long distances

356
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
And it's

357
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543
Predator 2 things like nb-iot

358
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
And

359
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
LTE Cat 1

360
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
That's that

361
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
So look for a new house in your life

362
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:54,367
It's not just a hug cuz they have a bunch of devices that you can actually wear for kids could wear that

363
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,183
Attracting someone so poor that I didn't want to just focus on the

364
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,327
Smart home devices kid trackers

365
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
So if you haven't

366
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
Already started outfitting your

367
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
Or if you're just crazy like me and

368
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,287
Hey I don't have a lawyer Network in my home yet

369
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,871
I have a dog that runs away

370
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
Keep tabs on the dog

371
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
Can I get the name I do

372
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,463
I just need for The Hobbit

373
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
All right now it's time for a

374
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Debate

375
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,143
Joanna Stern at the Wall Street Journal

376
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Read an article

377
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Explaining that she has a problem

378
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
With all female personal assistants

379
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,591
She thinks going forward we should be maybe a little bit less

380
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,919
Research shows that

381
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
Prefer

382
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,759
I guess dictating & Hearing responses from a female

383
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,807
Voice so I'm curious Kevin

384
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
Do you think I Robot should be both

385
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
I think

386
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,439
Choices good in all things

387
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,047
I realize I don't have I don't see your customized

388
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:10,655
The Voice the way you would like to know you can already do that with different accents or language packs and such

389
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,959
So why can't you pick male or female you

390
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,567
That's a good question like why isn't there a Sean Connery skills

391
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
I'm guessing because it

392
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Mutation that just

393
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
There are some like voice

394
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,551
You can get voices of specific people for certain apps and things I have seen that

395
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
The password can have you know

396
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
Batman read you your to-do list whatever

397
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:36,255
Personal Computing is it's personal and this is all part of personal Computing so

398
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
I should have that choice

399
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
You're dodging the sex

400
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
Question

401
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Thank you

402
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,007
What what's your thought I really thought about this a lot

403
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
Because

404
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,103
I'm a woman who has strong feelings about this

405
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,407
Strong feelings about you know feminism

406
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
ViaSat

407
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
In our culture

408
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
This doesn't bother me

409
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,063
As much and I really was trying to let it bother me

410
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,671
It didn't bother me well you know I really gave it a lot of thought

411
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Yeah it is kind of

412
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
I feel kind of

413
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
Ordering a female voice to do something

414
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
This is not a battle I feel like

415
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Really strong

416
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,823
Yeah I don't I don't see it look at a phone or a

417
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,663
Echo or NC gender I just don't know and I guess that's why I don't really

418
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
It does not bother

419
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,223
I want the choice

420
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
It doesn't bother me

421
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,111
So many rescued baby towards female voices at beginning

422
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,695
So there we are we are

423
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
For now I'd love to hear from you

424
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
If you're like

425
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Speaking

426
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
Personal assistants

427
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
Google

428
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
Home shopping

429
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
But it feels pretty Limited

430
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
I would say

431
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Rite Aid

432
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Which is why

433
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,991
What you can buy stuff online

434
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:07,903
Allows users to order stuff through Google Express and more than 50 retail

435
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
Partners

436
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,487
Doubt I have never use Google

437
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,767
Express I don't know if I even

438
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
Access to it

439
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,631
I have not used it I would imagine that you do I mean

440
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,447
You asked that's was going to say

441
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
How is the bulk of

442
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
States song

443
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,079
I'm sure that you could use it but

444
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,687
I don't use it I don't use any of the Amazon fresh or any other those types of

445
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,759
Express-Times shopping services so I couldn't speak to it

446
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,063
We use the CPU something

447
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
What do we use

448
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
We use Amazon pantry

449
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,207
But not express have used Amazon now

450
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Buy stuff

451
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,583
Order from Google Express

452
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,655
I've never done that so you can order from Bed Bath & Beyond

453
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
Buybuybaby

454
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
Nine West

455
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
Pier 1 Imports PetSmart

456
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
The Vitamin Shoppe

457
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
The shop

458
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Nevermind

459
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,015
My dad

460
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
To shopping list

461
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
At Whole Foods

462
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
Insolent

463
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Stack

464
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:22,655
It would be fun you know it is only through Google home I guess that's your Google Assistant because I could do this on my pixel

465
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
I don't have a Google home

466
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
I'll try it on

467
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,543
Okay I was going to say try it soon because I'm on the

468
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,127
Google Express web page it says through April 30th

469
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,431
This year when you shop via Google home

470
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,735
You don't have to worry about additional fees like ship

471
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
Woo

472
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
So now is a good time to try it

473
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Okay

474
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,159
If you follow me on Twitter

475
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,231
You probably have heard about my trauma with the Logitech

476
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
Harmony Home

477
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
I'm going to talk about that next week

478
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
Because

479
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
I think some of my drama maybe like

480
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
User error

481
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,983
So I have to spend some time with Logitech 2

482
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
Work that out so

483
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
We're going to talk about it

484
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
Anytime

485
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,783
Oh and I don't have any connection blinds but I can talk about them and I'll tell you why

486
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
Because

487
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,879
One of the folks I work with that Google actually I report to him

488
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,416
He's been getting into the smartphone

489
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,768
Has been asking me for suggestions how to smarten up his home

490
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
Heaven

491
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
On call

492
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
I mean really that bad

493
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
That's just great

494
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,264
Yeah I could be like the kind like a Geek Squad, come to your house

495
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,568
What do you want to do all right let's make it happen

496
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,344
Let's go to eBay you can rent me

497
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
So anyway he

498
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,208
He's got a hug now and they did not listen and do not

499
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,488
Github recommended

500
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:56,608
Instead he got something else

501
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,168
He's got some light switches going to be like you know

502
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,008
I just got her how to do my blinds I got these the song FeFe radio

503
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,080
Frequency controller on my God will probably not her megahertz

504
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:10,176
Hey did you know that sound P makes

505
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,272
Interface Walmart that basically takes the

506
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,600
Radio frequencies and converts them to Z-Wave

507
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
Just kind of

508
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,672
It's an interface except I guess you call it a bridge

509
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,488
Yeah it handle 16 channels and

510
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:28,352
Since I do not have some people lines that you do Stacy you educated me before the show

511
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,144
Explain how the channels work

512
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:34,240
My kind of phone is like what one channel promoter but not necessarily to most like

513
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
You could do scenes of

514
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
3 blinds

515
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,664
Let's do a quick breakdown of motorized shade

516
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,968
Because some of this is generic

517
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
If you're using like the automated Hunter

518
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
Neutron star

519
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
Arena

520
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
Motors and Shay

521
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
So

522
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,952
What you'll do is every individual

523
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Has

524
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,512
A motor that's going to go up

525
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,304
Down in it you know it depends on the size of your

526
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,120
Windows and all that somewhat like I have really large windows

527
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
So I have

528
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
Boaters kin

529
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
So it's not necessarily,

530
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,800
And you might

531
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,616
Want something where oh I'll my windows

532
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,408
Go up all at the same time

533
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
As opposed to Lake

534
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
Having two commands

535
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
And each individual one

536
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
So

537
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,040
Every time

538
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
You're going to group

539
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,112
Downloader

540
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,976
So depending on how many windows you have that's how many channels you should

541
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
So that's generic

542
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
With the salty stuff

543
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
I mentioned to Kevin

544
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,888
I have the sea wave

545
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
Module

546
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,472
Have an older version of it that has a literal click wheel on it

547
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,776
It's kind of a pain to setup

548
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
So

549
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:45,408
If you're working with any sort of Z-Wave thing that's going to control multiple

550
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,456
Channels are multiple devices

551
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,248
You're going to have to set up

552
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,040
With your hug you're going to set it up as a

553
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Brain

554
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,368
So you put it on your Winker you're smart

555
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
As like

556
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
I am a brain

557
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
And then

558
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,792
You have to use the other channels for

559
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
You know all the individual

560
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
So it's

561
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,632
It's not into it

562
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,240
But the pros

563
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Right

564
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
That's handy

565
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
Yes that's what my husband

566
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
But he's fast

567
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
For Christmas

568
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,600
Will you you got this module a couple years back the one that you can get the older one

569
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,160
And it was a couple hundred bucks

570
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
At the time

571
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
Dealer beeg

572
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,536
Because they didn't sell it on the in

573
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,888
Right right but now they sell the stuff on the internet

574
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,448
So I'm looking at Amazon right now and

575
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:44,288
For 289 the newer song 16 channel

576
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
Walmart juul is

577
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Sounds like a pretty good deal

578
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
I'm going to recommend it to

579
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,992
The person that I'm talking to and trying to help out so

580
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:58,112
I don't know how many blinds he hasn't haven't even details at Sitel know if he'll need more than one of these

581
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,928
Because 16 channels may go quickly if he's got a lot of motor

582
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
Yes now I would say

583
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
If you don't have a lot of

584
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,328
There is an easier solution

585
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Which is something now makes

586
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,400
It's out it's a

587
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,264
I think is Wi-Fi it's a salty radio protocol which is like art

588
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
Yes

589
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Is what they call it

590
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
To WiFi

591
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,616
And they call that the Milan

592
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:26,272
This is expensive this is like $175 on Amazon

593
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Instead of buying

594
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
I have like a remote

595
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,928
Blinds instead of doing that

596
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
My closet

597
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
But it was me

598
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,536
It actually integrates with Echo I believe

599
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,584
It also talks to iPhones

600
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
And Android phones

601
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,448
And is kind of actually if I had seen this

602
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
I probably

603
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
Cuz I would need two of them

604
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
I probably would have done that

605
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,104
Honest

606
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,384
If you have

607
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,224
It starts adding up at that

608
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
EXO

609
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,576
Because you did three of those replace all the channels this one

610
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,600
Unit cell

611
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
Well I'll give him both options and see what he does

612
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,000
Okay now it's time to talk about Wi-Fi routers

613
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,560
We love

614
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,888
So I have been trying the orbi router from that

615
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,752
This is in contrast to my house router which is the Eero mesh

616
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,056
Your some pots

617
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
The orbit

618
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
Is

619
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
Not a mesh Network

620
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,176
Is traditional

621
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
Traditional bassinet

622
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
It is

623
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,552
Network extender that just happens to have the same name

624
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,744
I basically put the main orbi router

625
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,072
In the middle of my house and I put the extender

626
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,400
Light socket to satellite in my office

627
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
At this end of the house

628
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,984
And I tried it in a couple places

629
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,032
My results were not

630
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,592
Is this is actually really great WiFi

631
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
It is a very powerful

632
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,432
But I think I would need another

633
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,504
Down at the other end

634
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
My house is my house in Spanish

635
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
Skinny

636
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,648
I can't stress this enough when you are picking a Wi-Fi network

637
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
Router basically

638
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,232
You are going to

639
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,280
Your house is going your mileage will vary

640
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,144
Without a doubt because the materials because of the the design

641
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:24,544
There's a lot of factors there's there's no way

642
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,384
Exactly so the orbi routers they cost

643
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,456
$400 my Eros cost 500

644
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
And so

645
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
You know

646
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
Is that for one base station on satellite

647
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,904
Churros cost

648
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,744
In my bedroom for example at the other end

649
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,024
My office

650
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,352
The network would slow it was slower at that Inn

651
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:52,960
It wasn't I still have 150 megabit per second connection so it wasn't me

652
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
Killing me

653
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
But I could definitely

654
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
Now

655
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,640
This did push out an amazing signal to my outdoor Wi-Fi

656
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
Camera

657
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,432
Which I have

658
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
The canary Flex running

659
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,736
Which

660
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,784
Hey doesn't actually play nicely with

661
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
Mesh networks right

662
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
Even though they're working on

663
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,160
So the orbi definitely made that cake

664
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
A lot better

665
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,024
When the satellite was in the middle of my house it did not work as well

666
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
Pretend camera

667
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,608
So that's why I kind of pushed it closer to the edge

668
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,680
And the other things to know about the

669
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
B router are

670
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,496
There is no app

671
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,288
You're going to have to go to the web

672
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
Login

673
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,872
And some people feel that this is a security

674
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,432
Issue is actually something that the FCC is got

675
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
Madelene

676
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
Jesus

677
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,296
How many spark is there

678
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,112
Hey you shouldn't have that open

679
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,392
Web-based login

680
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Not secure

681
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,488
Did you make you change your password

682
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,768
So that's nice

683
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:52,096
And the features are okay but again you have to go

684
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
Login

685
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
Log into the router

686
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
Where to change

687
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Switch

688
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,056
But you do ever you can do a guest Network I presume

689
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
Crucial

690
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
And

691
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,992
What supports lots of ports on it which I like in my

692
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,808
I have the Google onhub that I bought

693
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,856
And I also Google Wi-Fi unit

694
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,648
Check on a mission together

695
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,416
And

696
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,488
Kind of skimpy on the porch I think you have four on these guys

697
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Baidu

698
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
Brothers Subs

699
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,608
Are all my husband

700
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,144
I know I know

701
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,704
And he has good ratings

702
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
Cena and

703
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:35,360
Actually it's the favorite of The Wirecutter it's the favorite quote-unquote mesh Network for them

704
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
Even that's not technically

705
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,736
I've seen it give it 4 stars PC

706
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
It does have

707
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,040
Three ethernet ports

708
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,576
Kevin was saying so that is a

709
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,112
And that's

710
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,160
Router and on the Hub itself

711
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,464
It's super easy to set up even though

712
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
Do you have to use the weather

713
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
But you know

714
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
I think

715
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,072
For my house set up

716
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
Eros going to

717
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,120
A little bit better

718
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
Literal end-to-end

719
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,728
Bridgeprep went into my house

720
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,080
Right if you added a third unit

721
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,616
Second satellite in your case

722
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,456
Match what you have with the Eros is your three year old

723
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:17,344
Then maybe

724
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,904
Actually I think they just shoot me

725
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,696
More patlak more consistent

726
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,976
Signal strength

727
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,256
Throughout the whole house

728
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,584
$50

729
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,120
Yasso

730
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
Yeah

731
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,240
This is why I downsizing living townhouse now

732
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
Delete all those

733
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,568
My house is actually

734
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
Because of

735
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
What I do

736
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
My roof

737
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Yep

738
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,904
So that is all the news for this week so

739
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,000
Until next week so

740
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,816
The hundred episode

Happy

742
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
What if

743
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
I need like a little party

744
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,592
Aspire to get a noisemaker

745
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
If we were a

746
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
All right

747
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,784
Message from our sponsors

Who is the CEO of

751
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
Videon

752
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,024
To talk about how we're going to build an even more distributed internet

753
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,424
Hey everyone we're taking a break for the podcast for a few moments

754
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,544
To bring you a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is spending

755
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,824
And we have Brian

756
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
Toll from spin dance

757
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,432
Good how are you Stacy

758
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
I am great

759
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
So okay let's

760
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
Reminder audience

761
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,064
Who is Ben dance and what are you guys do

762
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,904
Sundance is a consultancy that helps organizations design

763
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,184
Develop and manage

764
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,512
The software for their iot products we work with Fortune 500 company

765
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,536
He's like whirlpool

766
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,376
Ford Motor Company along with smaller manufacturers and startups

767
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,960
Within that space we help with it strategy and we also

768
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,264
Do embedded cloud and mobile programming

769
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,544
Increasingly were asked

770
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,848
To develop voice application

771
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,128
Inspire customers to

772
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
Voice is indeed hot

773
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,968
So what are you guys see

774
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,528
Spin dance has actually been developing voice

775
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,576
Integration for the automobile industry

776
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
4 years

777
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,392
Amazon Echo and Google home

778
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,744
Are making that sort of Technology much more accessible for a typical iot product

779
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,024
Yes I've heard that

780
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,096
You can't even develop a consumer product now without some sort of voice

781
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,888
By our company's interests

782
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,824
Yes they are we're seeing more and more industrial and consumer customers looking at voice to improve the experience in places like

783
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
What kitchens are warehouses

784
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
Or even the fact

785
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,200
Before what should I be thinking about when

786
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
When I'm designing

787
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:58,880
First of all don't be afraid of it it's much easier to prototype a voice application that it is a mobile app

788
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
For example

789
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,696
Instead of a GUI with a G

790
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,488
You're really developing in Bowie

791
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,536
With a V and it's much easier to get in

792
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,096
You can build a prototype in just a day or two

793
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,656
It's also easier to do user research for voice

794
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:14,496
The flipside though is that testing and fine-tuning the voice app

795
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,288
Can be much more time consuming

796
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:22,688
Bennett mobile application so you definitely want to leave time for that at the end and in our experience the gooey part of

797
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,968
The application

798
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,528
Is the easy part. To your back and

799
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,064
Can be very difficult

800
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,440
It's not designed for voice integration

801
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,744
What should I be thinking about as I building

802
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,048
There's two things you want to keep in mind

803
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,072
What is

804
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,656
What is your back and look like and is it prepared to integrate with

805
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,936
A voice interface

806
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:50,592
Secondly if you're serious about it you're better off engaging Amazon and Google in developing the Africa

807
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,128
Patient getting their feedback

808
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,664
Sooner rather than later

809
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,224
And you worked with a couple customers already

810
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
What if they giving you is their feet

811
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,832
I think most people are aware of the skills

812
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
But you can write

813
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
For voice

814
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,160
Integration systems

815
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,464
And skills are similar to apps free

816
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,000
For mobile phones

817
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,608
But what they aren't aware of as you can actually embed the Alexa service directly into

818
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,632
Your own Hardware

819
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:17,984
Which is pretty cool people learn more about spin dance

820
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
Including voice

821
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:25,920
People can visit spin dance.com IRT to download a free whitepaper I'm building end-to-end iot products

822
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:31,040
And if they're interested in boys they can drop us an email at hello at spin dance.com

823
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:37,440
Let me be more than happy to talk to them about integrating voice into their iot products

824
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,840
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house

825
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
Stacey Higginbotham

826
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
And today's guest is

827
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,936
Jumperoo

828
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,984
Who is the founder and CEO of

829
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,568
Evenium who says he is building the internet of moving thing

830
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,384
Well basically you know we look at

831
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,784
Cars trucks and buses you know not just as machines that carry people and goods from one point to the other but as

832
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,088
Active nodes of the internet

833
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:09,440
And also as critical elements for smart cities

834
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:15,840
So once you look at these machines or no as mobile Wi-Fi hotspot says access points and network routers on Wii

835
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:20,960
I've been a lot of changes and that's basically what the name is doing is delivering a platform

836
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:25,568
Is he able to deliver this internet of moving things

837
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,592
Because all I can think of

838
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,128
How does this actually work

839
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,664
Is there going to be a software on my

840
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,992
Car for the users it's completely transparent

841
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,272
So you will use this

842
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,808
As any Wi-Fi hotspot

843
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:40,928
At home in in the office or in the cafe but essentially you know the network

844
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:47,328
Manages itself let me give you an example veniam the company I found it in the end manager

845
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,352
Actually

846
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
I deployed the largest

847
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,680
Vehicle mesh Network in the world

848
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,240
So we did this in Porto Portugal where we have

849
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:58,080
All the buses and some taxis garbage collection trucks

850
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:02,944
Serving as Wi-Fi hotspots and connecting to each other information to the internet

851
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,296
And today we actually serve free Wi-Fi to about 400 thousand users

852
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:13,696
Alberta hind the scenes are veiny arms Hardware software and call Solutions art you know making sure

853
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:20,096
That all of these devices are connected to each other and basically are not only providing free Wi-Fi but actually

854
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:23,424
Gathering all sorts of data for different types of applications

855
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,264
So how does this work from a technical perspective what is actually

856
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,944
The Venom is actually a full-stack company in that we owned the hardware the software in the cloud components that make

857
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,504
Networks of moving things possible and also

858
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,576
But allow us to offer no managed services

859
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,976
And so typically our customers are companies that own and operate large fleets and they come to us and say for exam

860
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,560
You know I have 400 bus has 200,000 passengers a year

861
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:56,960
I want them to have an excellent internet experience I want branding and advertising but I don't want to worry about

862
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,264
Hardware software SIM card cell data plans

863
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,568
How much does it cost me per month for a vehicle

864
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,200
To be able to offer a service like that to my customers and so we take care of

865
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,272
All of that in that hassle-free way

866
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,856
And then we are able to add other things like

867
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,696
Footage from surveillance cameras on board diagnostics Aldi's

868
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:23,840
High-bandwidth applications and ultimately you know the big advantages that are able to move

869
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:28,448
Massive amounts of data between the vehicles in the cloud at a very affordable cost

870
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
What is your back

871
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,800
For something like this cuz I can see the Wi-Fi on the buses I can see the

872
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,336
The management challenge

873
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
How is it actually can

874
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:42,528
It's a multi Network approach very much in the spirit of 5G in that we have youngboy devices

875
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:47,392
Is with wireless interfaces ranging from Wi-Fi to 4G LTE

876
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:53,792
Dsrc which is the standard for vehicle to vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication which actually use this

877
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,352
A frequency band The 5.9 gigahertz

878
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:03,008
That's in the US than in Europe has been reserved for intelligent transportation systems and it's so far underutilize

879
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,824
Until we're actually able to grab 75 megahertz

880
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,664
Spectrum that nobody else is using

881
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,808
Experience and so basically the device is choosing between these different networks and is also doing all the handovers

882
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,600
Between all these different Networks

883
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:24,000
So that you can jump on any bus start a Skype call or a YouTube video and even though the bus is switching but

884
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:29,632
Now I connect to this guy a call now I connect to this access point now I go back to Cellular

885
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,936
Your Skype call and YouTube video never break down

886
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:35,264
So we could actually be doing this interview in a moving bus

887
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,848
In Puerto or in Singapore or in a shuttle in downtown New York

888
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
I would like I live in Austin

889
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,688
I have no clue

890
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,272
This is really hard when

891
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,064
When Comcast in

892
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,392
It used to be Time Warner Cable within Cox they created this

893
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,672
Wi-Fi network for

894
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:56,512
The Northeast Corridor for trains and that sort of thing that took a lot of

895
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,096
Technical brain power to do handoffs over Wi-Fi

896
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,144
The cellular guys have done this for

897
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
A while

898
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,984
So is your kind of magic software the ability to

899
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,264
To manage all of this

900
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,288
Precisely

901
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,848
So the salad carriers I have done this for

902
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:15,200
Long time but this is in from South Station to seven

903
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,736
Shell station in the network.

904
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,040
Decentralised in which they control entirely

905
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:24,416
We're able to do that across different networks using different Technologies managed by different people

906
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,952
It is actually

907
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,512
Sadly most people will just be like

908
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,560
Dang it my Wi-Fi on my buses

909
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:37,472
But you know that that's because they don't have to build a network themselves

910
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:41,056
Let's break down the idea of now I've got Wi-Fi

911
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
On city buses

912
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,920
What does that enable and you know maybe I've got Wi-Fi enough

913
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,456
Let's just stick with the city stuff

914
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,504
Also.

915
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,296
On my city Vehicles MyCiTi bus

916
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,064
What can I do

917
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,648
Well most of all yours now transformed these vehicles

918
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,952
Into active nodes in the network

919
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:04,608
That is constantly moving and constantly evolving and so now everything else that you can do is actually software

920
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:11,264
Beyond providing fully-managed mobile Wi-Fi you can get tons of data from the vehicle to the cloud

921
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:17,920
At what do we want this for well for one we want to be able to know exactly how the vehicle is doing predict

922
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,224
If it's going to break down before it breaks down

923
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,856
Know the fuel consumption driver behaviour safety profile you want to get footage

924
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,160
Security cameras

925
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:34,048
Are high-bandwidth applications that are only possible you know where the network that is able to scale to provide that

926
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:40,448
And in the future you know with autonomous vehicles coming much much faster than anyone imagined and where mobile

927
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:46,848
Melody services are going to be provided you know on demand in the in a network like this you are going to have to move you

928
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:50,432
Many more terabytes of data between the vehicles in the clouds

929
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:55,296
And so ultimately you know the Wi-Fi applications just the first one that justifies

930
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,856
Placing an on-board unit in a vehicle

931
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:04,512
But once you do that you have a new network infrastructure that can allow you to do a lot more

932
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
Things on top of that

933
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,840
So you're providing basically

934
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,376
Cool mesh pipe

935
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
Cobble together

936
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,448
Is it

937
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,776
Are you guys also going to provide things like the data

938
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:20,384
Analysis for vehicular maintenance or does that actually go to some other

939
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:27,040
Once you have this Wireless interfit infrastructure Vehicles do you still need to bridge the gap to the cloud and make sure

940
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:33,440
Sure that you have very low latency mechanisms that allow you to actually capture the day to process the data locally decide what do I say

941
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:39,328
Immediately what do I send later so that then applications can actually do something about that those data streams

942
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,400
And so what we provide is that these data API

943
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,448
Some of the applications we do ourselves

944
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:50,848
Like mobile Wi-Fi doesn't mention but also mobile advertising so the ability to place contents in digital

945
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,384
Walgreens inside of buses

946
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,783
But then other applications like sleep management or telematics and be built on top of our platform by

947
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,879
Other players who have done this already for for fleets worldwide

948
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903
Awesome so

949
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,695
What kind of

950
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,279
City services can you provide once you have this network

951
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:15,679
So let's kind of dig into the idea of you know being able to provide bandwidth for cameras surveillance cameras

952
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
Sore

953
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,519
Maybe I'm trying to think if there's better wi-fi at bus stop

954
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
I don't know

955
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,823
So beyond having

956
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,223
Better connectivity and internet access for lots and lots of people in and also as a means to

957
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,527
Bridge the digital divide in in our cities

958
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:36,927
We can actually leverage all of the data that the vehicles are picking up not just to maintain the Via

959
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,975
Michaels or manage The Fleets more efficiently

960
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:45,375
But also to learn about the infrastructure about the city climate and and the

961
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:51,007
Any other things that are relevant to make our cities smarter safer and and nicer to live

962
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:56,895
At one example is that Porto already gets a date Avaya Venom's data's API

963
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:03,295
Two-time the traffic lights to

964
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
Smarter way

965
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,463
And that's just a few of the examples of how a city can become much better provider

966
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,255
Quality of life

967
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,791
If its uses

968
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,607
All these vehicles and we're talking essentially about

969
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,887
Fleet vehicles

970
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,423
As mobile sensors

971
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,983
Capturing Urban data at large scale

972
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
So where else

973
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
Provided the

974
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:33,247
So we have it at commercial level already in Puerto Singapore and New York

975
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:39,135
And we have a number of other cities right now that will be rolling out throughout this year

976
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,951
We like to partner with Telecom operators big

977
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,255
For three main reasons one is

978
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:50,143
The fiber in the cellular network we enable them to do more with their infrastructure and we obviously need the back hall

979
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:56,543
The second aspect is that they have access to a large number of customers that own and operate large fleets

980
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,103
Send so they can also help us distribute the solution

981
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,431
A number three Telecom operators are themselves

982
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,479
Owners of very large fleas

983
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:10,623
That we can use again for as as mobile but also as mobile sensors for urban data

984
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:17,023
So right now our strategy is to partner with with Telecom operators and and leverage these three

985
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
She makes a lot of sense

986
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:23,167
I'm it also gives you great Network effects cuz if you were going after individuals

987
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,191
I'm like

988
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,983
I think it was cool

989
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,775
Having my one car roaming around

990
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:28,799
Does nothing

991
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,567
Are very low

992
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:35,967
If you think about it there are 1.2 billion vehicles in the world and only 5% of them are connected to the internet

993
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:42,367
Initially we did think about a consumer approach and adding it to private vehicles but then we realized that

994
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:47,487
No private Vehicles go to work in the morning and they come back in the evening so they're limited network effects there

995
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:52,095
And on the other hand fleet vehicles are 26% of vehicles worldwide

996
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:58,495
And that percentage is growing every single day they traveled more than 50% of the deal

997
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,519
Miles

998
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:04,639
And so as you think of Norman's disruption in which the transportation sector is right now with

999
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:08,991
People taking Uber and Lyft and leaving their cars at home

1000
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:15,391
Then you're saying that the percentage of fleet vehicles is only increasing and once the autonomous vehicles come in

1001
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,463
Which most people predict to be around 2020

1002
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,559
Then we are actually going to see that most of the vehicles are going to be pleased

1003
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
And so looking at that

1004
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,631
These fleets

1005
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,935
Mobility as a service providers

1006
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,543
As part of the infrastructure I believe this the right way to think about

1007
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,847
The future and how cities can become

1008
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:39,199
You know more efficient wave iron mentally sustainable and provide an even better quality of life

1009
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,503
Right because actually these people

1010
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:47,903
Living in dense urban areas where this makes the most sense are the ones most likely to give up their car

1011
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,975
Switch to an Uber and automated system

1012
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,511
Bringing in something like

1013
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:58,911
Drones in I just thinking crazy thoughts here because I love drones and I think it's kind of fun so I'm trying to imagine you know

1014
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,703
Could you much like

1015
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:04,031
Google and Facebook are trying to create connectivity with like

1016
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,079
Everything from balloons tula

1017
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,383
Find airplane solar powered airplanes

1018
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175
What about bringing something like

1019
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:17,599
So Google is looking at balloons Facebook is looking at drones so venom has its feet a little bit closer to the ground

1020
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:21,951
So please locate vehicle and we started with vehicles because they're everywhere

1021
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,231
They have batteries

1022
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,047
That keep recharging so we don't have to worry about energy

1023
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:32,447
And they even have their own Vehicles can use but it's just the beginning

1024
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,263
What we call the internet of moving things

1025
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,079
We have a market segment

1026
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,639
That shows us points as to what

1027
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:44,735
The future of cities going to look like which are industrial environments like

1028
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:50,623
Ports and airports in construction sites where actually the internet of things in my view is progressing the fastest

1029
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:54,463
Type of rhino industry 4.0 approach

1030
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,863
Actually connecting everything in the controlled space like that makes a lot of sense in and our first customer was actually a container term

1031
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,703
Why we have not only trucks but also cranes and boats

1032
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
And other

1033
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,263
Mobile assets

1034
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:13,663
That are providing connectivity but also Gathering real-time data to make the operations more efficient sober

1035
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:19,039
Bring ships faster in an asteroid loading and unloading them with with greater safety

1036
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,623
And so I think that there we can see that you know in the future

1037
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
You're going to have

1038
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,463
Yes not just beer in Connected vehicles that

1039
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,767
That build internet of moving things but also

1040
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:34,655
Robots drones all of these things need to be connected and that's where you know we have to

1041
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:39,007
Be real and accept the fact that the current Internet is actually

1042
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,287
Not ready

1043
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,079
For the massive

1044
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:48,479
Mobility and the type of machine-to-machine connectivity requirements that all of these mobile

1045
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,551
Acids are removing things are going to to need

1046
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,855
And so to be able to scale we need the network

1047
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:58,719
Effects of mesh technology we need the ability than to process all these data streams

1048
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,279
That they arrived at the cloud in a way that

1049
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,839
Ensure is the best operation mime on all of these

1050
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
Moving things

1051
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,399
That's why I do things

1052
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,959
Drones are a part of the equation but think robots

1053
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:14,847
The future of autonomous vehicle which is not going to look at all like the vehicle we have today

1054
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:20,479
What are some of the big challenges of building basically an autonomous Network that's going to be made up of

1055
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,527
Hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of thing

1056
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:29,183
Well the key is to move towards Distributing also the intelligence and decision and not

1057
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
Just the device

1058
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:32,511
In the sense that you know if you expect

1059
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:37,887
All of these devices to have the connection to one Central brain that is basically orchestrating the whole thing

1060
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:44,287
Then you run into problems of latency security single point of failure

1061
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:47,359
All sorts of obstacles to actually making

1062
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:51,711
Leveraging the network effects that you get from having more and more devices

1063
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:55,807
Essentially the technical challenges to the find the local rules

1064
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:02,207
I buy which these devices interact with each other and engage with each other that ultimately generate the kind of emergency

1065
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,231
Behavior for the network

1066
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:07,071
That is desirable in ensure is that it doesn't break down

1067
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:13,471
And so defining this local rules that's a lot of the work that we do as many again vehicles

1068
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:19,871
Good way to start special leaf lease because automatically the vehicles that the buses trust each other they belong to the same Fleet and survive

1069
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:23,455
All of them competing for the wireless access they can actually

1070
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,015
Coordinators wireless access among each other

1071
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,319
And share those network resources in the

1072
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,855
Smarter better way

1073
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,159
Until we work a lot on this notion that

1074
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,719
We have local clusters of nodes that

1075
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,255
Help each other

1076
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:42,655
I make the best use of the available network resources

1077
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
Private are for

1078
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:50,079
Running around at the same city do they share their connectivity yes only occur

1079
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,383
When you actually have those interactions

1080
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,783
And so you have to insure end-to-end security so there's no privacy breaches but at the same time at the network level

1081
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,367
These are nodes in the network that's basically cooperate with each other

1082
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:08,511
And also the access points are multi-tenancy in that you have the same infrastructure but they are used by

1083
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:13,375
Different operators in different Tennyson so that's also part of the platform

1084
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:19,775
What is the Temple of this is exactly how many key Global players are thinking today about 5G

1085
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:23,615
With 5G I'm seeing a completely different attitude it's more about

1086
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,967
Ensuring that you know all these different networks are able to work together

1087
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:34,367
To ensure that everyone has the connectivity there Nita and I welcome this approach because I do think that

1088
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:40,767
The future is going to be

1089
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,303
Using in different ways

1090
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,703
A big hurdle to overcome actually has nothing to do with technology that has to do with finding the right business models that also

1091
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,983
Autoscale

1092
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,263
How much is this going to

1093
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,871
Cost because right now Cellular's expensive Wi-Fi quote-unquote free so

1094
00:50:56,127 --> 00:51:00,479
How do you think about building a business model around all of these Technologies in

1095
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,015
For an ecosystem

1096
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:06,879
So today the revenue for mobile Wi-Fi comes from to Maine

1097
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:13,279
Sides one is the preservation companies themselves who want to increase ridership provide a better quality of experience and so

1098
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:19,679
So they are willing to pay for the the extra connectivity they're giving for free to people

1099
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,983
The second is through advertising

1100
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:28,383
So you have a captive audience that is ready to receive the content and not just on the splash screens but actually on

1101
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,967
Digital screen put inside and outside so that's one model

1102
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:36,831
But then there's also the monetization of the urban data picked up by the vehicles

1103
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:43,231
Which is interesting nachos for cities and municipalities is also interesting again for all sorts of

1104
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:47,839
Players in the private sector can pick up a lot of local data

1105
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:54,239
Set the saddle as I'm not able to pick up for example you know the pictures of the the windows of certain shops

1106
00:51:54,495 --> 00:52:00,639
Start counting the people in different parts of the city all of this is anonymized so that you don't break the user privacy but you're actually able

1107
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,199
Call them tomorrow. Very valuable data

1108
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:09,599
That many players say for example foot traffic in different parts of the city in different parts of the days valuable

1109
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:15,999
For the huge number of Industries high and so that's the kind of thing that will enable us to fund the connected

1110
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:22,399
Give it to you later on once we get to critical mass of connected vehicles and and the critical mass of users

1111
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,679
Okay

1112
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,959
I can't wait to see this everywhere

1113
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,727
So hopefully

1114
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,031
Feel like I can't wait either

1115
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,615
I think it's a necessity for future life

1116
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:36,479
All right I shall enjoy thinking about what can happen when my car is both a sensor and a hotspot

1117
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,759
So thank you Joe

1118
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:44,671
Perfect thank you so much space it's been a pleasure
