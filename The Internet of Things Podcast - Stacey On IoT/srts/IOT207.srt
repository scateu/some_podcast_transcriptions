Efforts

10
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,952
We got a little bit of a discussion about facial recognition

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:35,584
Going to talk about the latest airline crash and what it means for connected devices and software in more places

12
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,888
We got a bunch of news bits

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,912
Trump Google

14
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
And

15
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,728
We're going to be talking about

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,288
More connected appliances coming on the market

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,104
Amazon finished its Arrow acquisition

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
Are your data

19
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
Plus

20
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,968
We're going to here

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,016
From our sponsor of pharaoh

22
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,040
On why you need an

23
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,320
Iot platform

24
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
And

25
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,136
I am going to bring you

26
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,976
To South by Southwest because I hosted a panel

27
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,792
So I guess this week is actually lots of people

28
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,560
It is

29
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,120
Participants from that panel on the Smart Home

30
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:12,192
That was sponsored by you know me and we're going to hear from

31
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,728
Folks from Dallas

32
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
Tendril

33
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
Charter

34
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,824
LexisNexis and iRobot

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,896
Voice recorded live so you're getting here a little bit of like

36
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,944
Fart noises in the background because he

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
It South by Southwest but

38
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,272
It's a really awesome

39
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
Panel and

40
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
So

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
Before we get started

42
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
Let's hear from this week sponsor this week sponsor is Western Digital Western did

43
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:41,632
Digital builds Data Solutions that enable the world to solve its biggest challenges

44
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:48,032
Beat its newest nvme ssds the essence 6:30 and the essence

45
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
720

46
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,384
Performance endurance scalability

47
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,968
For next-generation workloads in the cloud and at the edge

48
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:02,368
So Step Up 2 nvme performance at westerndigital.com

49
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
For those of you who are like

50
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,464
What the heck is an nvme

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
SSD

52
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
Kevin can you tell us

53
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,560
I can only because I built

54
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,864
Gaming PC with my son last weekend and

55
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,704
Aside from traditional SSD which is already fast

56
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,776
We installed an nvme SSD

57
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
Which is super fast like

58
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,176
The biggest insane transfer speeds with this so this is the way of the Future 4

59
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
Fast

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
Data transfer on computers

61
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
Awesome so

62
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
Way of the future

63
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
You heard it here first

64
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,904
Let's kick this show off with

65
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,488
Conversation about Charter this is news I'm actually

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,792
Well originally I was excited about then

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Bummed because

68
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
Charter CEO

69
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
Tom run

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,704
Rutledge said that the ISP

71
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
Cable companies

72
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
Isb

73
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,848
Was going to roll out a smart home management

74
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Platform

75
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
In Austin Texas

76
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,944
That's where you are

77
00:02:59,456 --> 00:02:59,968
Yeah

78
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
Today but they're going to roll it out in the

79
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
Fall

80
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
So

81
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,672
I was a little bummed about this but the story is interesting basically

82
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,232
Rutledge was speaking of the Deutsche Bank Media

83
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,768
Internet until c** comp

84
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,304
Big deal

85
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:19,424
And he said that Charter is developing a quote-unquote control plane to help

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
Customers manage the devices that connect to their

87
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,824
Particularly from a privacy and security stamp

88
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
This news is not surprising

89
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
We have seen

90
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,248
Comcast actually Focus very deeply on this both for me

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
Wi-Fi just making it better

92
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
Through an arrangement with

93
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
Peacock plume

94
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:42,976
And also through an arrangement with a company called Cujo it is implemented security Serv

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
So I think

96
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,328
What isps are basically doing is saying

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
Oh man

98
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
We have got to get up

99
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,216
And be responsible for Wi-Fi at home security

100
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
In customers homes

101
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
Comcast actually charges you

102
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,592
For this privilege

103
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:04,224
And I am very curious if Charter will see this as a new business opportunity as well

104
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,552
Like you said this is not surprising and I personally am not a

105
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,904
Cable subscriber anymore I haven't been for three years nor my big unlikes

106
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Subscriptions

107
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
However

108
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,047
No Comcast XVI and now this new Charter platform and others

109
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,887
I probably wouldn't have a problem paying for the platform

110
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
If

111
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
It closes the security loopholes and gaps that are in a lot of beatitude products today like I would pay for that piece of mind

112
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,127
Tiffany if the device makers and such are not going to

113
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
Truly provide it

114
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,943
Then I'm okay with that

115
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,783
Yeah I don't think you could control all the security looks like there's a lot of

116
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
Insecure things such as

117
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
Hey

118
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,183
Once your password is in the cloud is it stored correctly or

119
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
My gosh

120
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,863
I got a weakness in some of my radio Technologies and again those hats do require physical access to the.

121
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
Zorbing near the device in most cases

122
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
It won't solve everything

123
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
Realself something

124
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
It makes it better I'm off work

125
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Excellent

126
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Next up

127
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,407
Are two stories on facial recognition that

128
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
Scare the pants off

129
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,991
The first is from BuzzFeed

130
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,807
Which published documents from the e f f

131
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
The basically showed that

132
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,439
The government is basically going to use facial recognition in airports

133
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
2

134
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
Track

135
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,303
American citizens as they enter the country

136
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
And use that to

137
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
Basically with four people who are

138
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
Not supposed to be

139
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
Entering the country

140
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,495
What they didn't do

141
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
As part of this is

142
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
They didn't set any limits on how

143
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,639
Airlines could use that facial recognition data

144
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Which feels like

145
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
And they also

146
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
Didn't have any public

147
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Comment about

148
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,367
Hey everybody we're going to be using facial recognition to track you when you come into the country

149
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,439
And didn't ask how we all felt about that as Citizens

150
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
That was not awesome

151
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Write the next news item

152
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
On facial recognition

153
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
Was an NBC news story

154
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:03,007
It showed that many of the facial recognition algorithms that are being built right now are being built using photos

155
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,567
Scrape from websites without users

156
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Consent

157
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
So IBM put out a big database

158
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
Got a year ago at

159
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
I think it was

160
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
And it was

161
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:18,111
Lauded is awesome because it had truly diverse people in it so a big problem with facial recognition is

162
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
When do you collect images from

163
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
People computer scientist had been using

164
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,767
A lot of images of white people so it was really

165
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,095
Not awesome when it came to any people of color

166
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
Or even women in some case

167
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,703
So IBM was like how we will fix that

168
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
And they annotated

169
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
A lot of photos what

170
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,335
We didn't realize they pulled those photos from

171
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Flickr

172
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,663
An annotated them and then provided the database to pee

173
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,015
Write this is all to train the algorithm switch okay then

174
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,087
Makes sense to me and facial recognition is actually

175
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
Little more tricky than

176
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
Object recognition because

177
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
People

178
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
Change over time

179
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,303
So I get why they want to use these photos but just going out

180
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,631
On the web mean I don't know how many photos of Muir on the where the heck of a lot

181
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:07,007
There's more my dog that's irrelevant without my consent like that to train the models I'm not sure I'm thrilled with that

182
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
We are entering

183
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Scary

184
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Fairy

185
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
Deep water

186
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:17,247
Is here is an unknown area where we should be having conversation

187
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
It's not just about

188
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,623
How we get these images to train the data and also how we're training things have

189
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,719
But we're optimizing for in facial recognition is basically optimizing for accuracy

190
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
And the person

191
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
So

192
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,583
It's good that we recognize that these weren't accurate

193
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
Four huge swaths of the population

194
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
And try to fix that

195
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
But

196
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
It's scary to think

197
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,775
Your photographs might be

198
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Used

199
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
I guess help improve this

200
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,919
Yay and then see it being used for something

201
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
Without people's consent like

202
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
Border control

203
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,343
It comes back to something you said many times and it really stuck with me

204
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,183
Once you give up the date at once you lose the data control

205
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
You don't know what's going to be done with it

206
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Yeah

207
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
It might be good if I be bad

208
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
But you know we should probably talk

209
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
Absolutely

210
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,447
Now will move into our next big story of the week

211
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Witches

212
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Which is another air crash

213
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
Is 1 in

214
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:18,175
Ethiopia which was also a Boeing 737 Max this was the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight

215
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
302

216
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,503
5 months prior we saw the crash of

217
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
Lion Air

218
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,855
And we have talked about this on the show but basically the issue

219
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,951
The we highlighted was The Lion Air crash was a result of

220
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
A sensor reporting inaccurate info

221
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Information

222
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,095
And the pilots of the plane

223
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,399
Fighting to keep the nose of the airplane

224
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,191
Up when the sensor

225
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
Which was inaccurate

226
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
Information was telling it

227
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
To go down

228
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,871
It was actually making the plane Point down

229
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,223
What town in the second part of this that we found out later

230
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
Was the Des Plaines

231
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
And this

232
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,647
Problem was actually a result of Boeing updating the 737 with

233
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
With a software update

234
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
That changed some of the way that

235
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
Spleen function

236
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
And in the pilots

237
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
We're not perhaps

238
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
Made completely aware

239
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,679
So when that malfunction happened

240
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,751
The pilots reacted as they have been trained to do

241
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
On the non updated version

242
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,871
And that helped lead to the crash

243
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
And thus

244
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,943
We got into a conversation about

245
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Hey

246
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
Software updates

247
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Need training

248
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
And

249
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
How all of that

250
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
That plays out

251
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
This week in the wake of the

252
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
Latest crash

253
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
Of this jet

254
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Many

255
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,535
Many countries have grounded these

256
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Particular Airlines

257
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
The US has yet

258
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
Two grounded as of Wednesday morning

259
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,191
But we're also seeing a lot of

260
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,799
Hot takes on this where they like you don't want to drive in a self-driving car

261
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
After this and

262
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639
A lot of stories that are not helpful

263
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,967
They're freaking out and they don't talk about the things that we need to do

264
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,039
When we trust more of our infrastructure

265
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,343
Just software and automation

266
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
We need to think about

267
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
How we instill safeguard

268
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,535
The hot takes are making a very high-level logical leap

269
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,375
Details

270
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,679
That comes down to management software updates

271
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
Communication of those updates

272
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,823
At least in the case about when are playing me for self-driving cars self-driving you wouldn't have to

273
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
Train the person so to speak

274
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
After software update

275
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Testing

276
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,735
Are there so many factors no different than

277
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
Then

278
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Any kind of

279
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
Suffer

280
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:36,159
Has to be properly tested has to be documented has to be communicated

281
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
And

282
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,255
VDS inherent dangers in relying upon

283
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,351
Sensors that could be program faulty or could fail I suppose but

284
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,191
To make that logical leap like hey this is a problem at all self

285
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,519
Driving or whatever Vehicles is just not smart

286
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,847
And it brings home to me the fact that

287
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
Even if we have self-driving vehicles

288
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,455
We're still going to have to have

289
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
People responsible

290
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
For them

291
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
Somewhere

292
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
Are in the chain so

293
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
I actually wrote about this for IEEE

294
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
After interviewing a bunch of

295
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,231
Connect to car makers and this was actually a big topic

296
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
This winter is CES

297
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:19,167
Is everyone acknowledging that yes there will still be people in the chain and the reason is

298
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,239
Sometimes software can fail sometimes computers will

299
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Have

300
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
Weird situations that they're like

301
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
I don't know what to do here

302
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
And that's what a human operator

303
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Take over

304
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
There always has to be in my opinion a

305
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,039
I take over mode that is very quickly and easily excessive

306
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,855
So I think the big thing to think about is

307
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Hey

308
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,207
If you're updating software on something and that's actually what happened

309
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,023
Boeing updated the software and said

310
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,119
Did it was similar enough to Prior generations of the plane

311
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,167
The pilots didn't need to be retrained

312
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
Because that was something that would

313
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
Cost a lot of money and time

314
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
It would lead

315
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,591
Customers Airline customers to say yeah we're going to pass on this pretty

316
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
Eurasian boy wants to sell planes

317
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
Suicide no

318
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
You don't need

319
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,247
Extra training for your Pilots

320
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
And the FAA said

321
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
Alright sure

322
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
And then

323
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Didn't get the training

324
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
And this is what happen

325
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,975
Fence and so there's a lot of layers here

326
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
Quick-take of

327
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Connected devices that are

328
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,631
Controlled by computers are bad is not the right time

329
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,191
We're going there we have to go there

330
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
There are things that are too complex for

331
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
People

332
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
To handle

333
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,663
And I do believe self-driving cars will ultimately be safer

334
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,967
And as we add software

335
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
To these devices

336
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,343
We're going to have to establish new regulatory procedures

337
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,391
Recognize how much software

338
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Change

339
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
The operational experience

340
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
And then enforce basic rules like

341
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
Yeah

342
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
Rules around testing software

343
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
Rules around training The Operators

344
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Etcetera

345
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
Okay that was like

346
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Hohhot

347
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
Haha take on the hot take

348
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
Which was a cooler take

349
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
So

350
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,895
Let's talk about smart displays because Google

351
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Has just gone

352
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Got nuts

353
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,223
Google is God nuts

354
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,015
Continued conversation

355
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,855
Are smart displays is now out for Google devices

356
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
This means what

357
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:21,791
What this means just like your smart speakers either you or Echo devices or your Google home devices

358
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,095
You can start a conversation with a

359
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
Google smart display and then continue it

360
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
Up until now

361
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
You would ask question like

362
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
What is the weather

363
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,591
But you couldn't follow up with what is the weather for tomorrow how about

364
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Next week

365
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:40,991
Cancel. Now you can do that we tested it right before the show on my Google home hub here in the office in it

366
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,807
Work pretty well there's even a little in Decatur now

367
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,111
At the top left to show you visually that

368
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,695
The display is still listening for a continued conversation

369
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Yes

370
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Next Google story

371
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
This isn't

372
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
White

373
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
Coyote story but

374
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
It may be soon

375
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,703
So Google has moved its machine learning for speech recognition down to the phone

376
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
I got this this morning it was like hey

377
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
Do you watch faster speech recognition on your keyboard

378
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
Download this

379
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
It was small was actually very small

380
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
What and it's not yours

381
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Faster

382
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,367
Because up until now everything would go out to the cloud Google would do its natural language processing and and send it back to you

383
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
It works offline

384
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
Yes

385
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
And that's what

386
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
Exciting so guess right now it's on the phone

387
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,815
Yay phones have a lot of processing power

388
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
They have a lot of storage

389
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
But

390
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
Imagine this on your smart display

391
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:35,007
Suddenly local control of things or things when there is no internet access

392
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,311
As long as it's not a cloud to Cloud integration

393
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,359
We could start seeing local control

394
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
So that would be awesome

395
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
I'm a fan

396
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Google pixel phone

397
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:49,855
Google pixel phones there was a feature announced that last year's Google IO called Lookout

398
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,695
That is now available to pixel phones I have not used it on my pixel

399
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
But what Lookout is

400
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,303
It is a way for the phone

401
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
To provide

402
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,447
Information about someone's surroundings meaning somebody who is a visually impaired

403
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,055
So the phone could be your set of eyes R example with Lookout

404
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
And

405
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,687
If you're visually impaired you can hold your phone around the room and it could tell you what objects are in there dog

406
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
Speaker table

407
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Chair

408
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
So very cool

409
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Also

410
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
Are the accessibility friend

411
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
We've got an update

412
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
From Microsoft

413
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:27,231
Right now Microsoft has a similar product called seeing AI

414
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,303
And they are pushing forward with some new features

415
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
With their custom vision service

416
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:36,191
To explore photos by touch which is a really interesting so

417
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
You can

418
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:41,055
Can I have a spoken description of something on a screen if you touch the screen

419
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,639
They brought this to the iPad as well now so it's not just on

420
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:49,503
They've also brought this seeing AI to iPads what you did not have before so

421
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,551
They are pushing forward with

422
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
Accessibility things

423
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
2

424
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
You don't make life better

425
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,927
But using the cloud and sensors

426
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
That's awesome yes I actually

427
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,047
After I did another talk at South by Southwest

428
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Yesterday

429
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:07,679
And afterwards somebody who worked on Google Assistant doing accessibility stuff came up and talked

430
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,543
And I was really excited to see the enthusiasm with which she

431
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,103
She didn't tell me anything that was like particularly

432
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
She obviously didn't share the

433
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Product roadmap

434
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:23,807
But we talked very badly about the need for accessibility and it felt very much like this was an important initiative

435
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,367
Obviously for her personally because it's her job

436
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
But even at goo

437
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,231
I'm encouraged as we bring voice

438
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
And

439
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,815
Speakers more broadly into our home

440
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
We're also

441
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
Bringing technology to people who

442
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,447
May have historically had a difficult time

443
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
Yeah I think this is a

444
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,055
I want saying overlooked Market but I think

445
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:51,455
A lot of developers and product makers out there don't dismiss it but don't give it the attention it deserves I see a lot of opportunity

446
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,599
Be there I just mentioned to you Stacey before the show that my comp sci Professor reached out to me this morning saying

447
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,951
Hey we've got a blind student in the music program year college and

448
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,511
They can't use the music Boards

449
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,607
Programming music Boards because the button so we can see them they light up and

450
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,935
Green might be in a certain instrument red light mean another instrument and

451
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:17,311
So we're going to try and buy some either interface or a braille silicone keyboard overlay for this person

452
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
I never would have thought to do that

453
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383
I mean there's just so many

454
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,735
So many opportunities in this area for four Good Hits just a bit mazes

455
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
And

456
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,831
In a lot of ways and this is actually philosophy at Amazon

457
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
Designing things that are accessible

458
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,695
Make it easier and better for

459
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,231
Any number of other people

460
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,559
So when you're doing things for the visually impaired

461
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,911
You're actually also helping people who are maybe older and unable to

462
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
C as well

463
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,727
Okay moving

464
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
Rachel all we have

465
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
An appliance store

466
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,127
GE Appliances has signed up

467
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,919
To add Wi-Fi

468
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,967
Capability via serrant

469
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
And

470
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
If you guys are like what is happening

471
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
Basically sierant is a company

472
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,879
Was actually bought by Cypress recent

473
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,975
Is a company that makes it easier to get devices online

474
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
What happens is

475
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,095
It uses what is essentially a public Wi-Fi network

476
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
Created by

477
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,959
Most Wi-Fi routers from isps today

478
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
Have a public setting and a

479
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
A private setting

480
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,311
You use the private setting

481
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
But the public setting

482
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,431
It can actually be used for like a cable providers Wi-Fi network

483
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,479
Or a company like Siri

484
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,039
Associate has these deals in place to use that

485
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,623
What it does is the connected Appliance gets on that public net

486
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
Work in the moment

487
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,975
You plug it in it Finds Its token in the cloud

488
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
K'Nex

489
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,839
And then you can connect it as a consumer if you want to

490
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,423
And then once you connect it you're going to do a hand over from

491
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Public network

492
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
Your personal net

493
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,287
So Electrolux is done this

494
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,079
They were one of the first big customers

495
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Hours for Sears

496
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Bose has another

497
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,943
And now geappliances Society

498
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,039
The reason I'm interested in this and the reason I'm telling you about this

499
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
Is because

500
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,927
That public network makes it possible for your appliances to be online without you bringing

501
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,791
Which could worrisome people I actually think it's

502
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,863
Mostly a positive and the reason I say that

503
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
Is because if

504
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,471
GE has this always connected device in your

505
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
You can actually

506
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
When you call in and say hey

507
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,383
My water filter doesn't seem to be working

508
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,431
They can say something along the lines of

509
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:35,551
Well would you mind if I looked up Diagnostics on that device and if you opt-in

510
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,343
They can say okay

511
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:43,487
Look up the Diagnostics and then suddenly tell you from afar what's wrong and then send the repair person out with

512
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
With the right

513
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Heart

514
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
Time Saver

515
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,447
Yeah overall I think this is a positive but I do think it's something consumers should know so you might be bringing in

516
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
Appliance that

517
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,799
Is connected to the internet even though you haven't connected it

518
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,127
I would hope that Appliance companies are not

519
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,919
Using data from this without

520
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Your permission

521
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
But it is something

522
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,015
And I do think ultimately

523
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,343
It is a good feature having had devices in my home

524
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
Home appliances breakdown

525
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,719
I regret actually every time one of my appliances breaks down because I'm like

526
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
Smart

527
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
I could just be like

528
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,351
I'm sending someone out with this part to fix

529
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
Yeah even some of the

530
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
I'll call them

531
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:29,567
Little glitches in cooking with the June oven for example from time to time something has happened in the past 2 years

532
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,663
Going to customer support or like do you mind if we get the logs off of your machine and

533
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,711
You know they ask him in advance

534
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,503
And you either concentric or don't

535
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,575
But having that data has solved the problem every single time

536
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:45,951
Yeah so as long as there's transparency around the connectivity and transparency around

537
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,743
Opting into sharing the data

538
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
All

539
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Or it

540
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:53,119
So I thought I'd share that with you guys cuz it's probably not something

541
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
You're thinking about

542
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
And finally

543
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
The Amazon

544
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,031
Deal for Eero the Wi-Fi mesh Wi-Fi company

545
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,311
Has been completed

546
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
And both companies

547
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:08,735
Promise promise promise pinky pinky pinky swear that they are not going to share your data

548
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,855
Yeah there's a really good blog post on that Euro site just reiterating

549
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
That

550
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,696
Amazon chairs that Euro philosophy about

551
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,256
Captain customer data at having customer Trust

552
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,864
And they say with every new product and feature reveals this is very promising to me

553
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,472
We will adhere to our guiding principles they do explain the three principles which are

554
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,264
You know you have the right to privacy

555
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,824
They need to be transparent with potatoes are collecting

556
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,664
They only collect Network diagnostic information improve performance at such

557
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:41,504
And they try to actively minimizing outdated a access

558
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,088
M&a to access your data they treated with the utmost security so

559
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
I mean that's a very positive thing of it

560
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,928
High-level high mean

561
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,512
But it's it should be a good people on Pacific

562
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
We can link back to it

563
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
Two years without

564
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,376
So that's just my cynical

565
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm so sorry

566
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,448
But we can take this full circle

567
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Because

568
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:07,360
Cheetah habitat about Charter and their device management Security Services Amazon's actually building this to

569
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,920

571
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
Kevin definitely sees it

572
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
We're going to have

573
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
Amazon devices that

574
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,392
Double is Wi-Fi routers and then hero also has

575
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
A security service

576
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,744
Basically the industry believes that we will need

577
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
Awesome WiFi

578
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
They're working on that and

579
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,584

Along with a very easy way to set it all up

582
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
And I agree with you

583
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776

The eye

626
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:10,240
Put outside for my patio and I install outdoor outlet just for it I'd like to be able to switch it on and off

627
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,264
Can I get you a smart

628
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,080
Switch to my SmartThings Hub so I can hard reset

629
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
Stopping to get a lighter

630
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
We'll have a hard time finding

631
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,224
A Z-Wave plug that will stay inside like a waterfall

632
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,296
Does Outlet out there and I'm trying to figure out what my best solution is

633
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,856
Or maybe something that since its usb-powered

634
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,672
Outlets like a Z-Wave USB

635
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,720
Thank you guys okay Kyle

636
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,744
I have really

637
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
One product

638
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
For you

639
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,144
That makes it easy it does make it easier to quit voicemail

640
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
So

641
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:45,312
I have these fabulous Z-Wave Outlet plugs and I've had them for years all around my house that using for my Halloween Christmas and any other random

642
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
Outdoor decorations

643
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
Want to use it for

644
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,664
They are made by Jasco

645
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:56,320
There's actually a version of this on Amazon it's got the Chasco 45 704 and it's about

646
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
$28

647
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
Which is an awesome deal

648
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,672
Jessica was the company that makes

649
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,512
The same product for both Honeywell and GE

650
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,304
But GE

651
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,864
He has their product which is the GE and Brighton

652
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,424
Z-Wave plus outdoor smart plug switch

653
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,984
That sells for 40 to 50

654
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
I Amazon

655
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,848
And then Honeywell also has a Honeywell Z-Wave plus outdoor on off

656
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,152
Like an appliance switch for $40

657
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
So

658
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
You have the same product

659
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,528
Couple different prices

660
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,344
The downside of this product is

661
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,136
It is not IP

662
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
Faded

663
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,720
It is rated for a UL standard

664
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
Because it's pul

665
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,280
To get that standard I have

666
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
How to pay the UL to see the whole

667
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,608
It is water resistant

668
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
Basically

669
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
It is not water

670
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
So

671
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,984
I would not plug this in

672
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
A place that

673
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
You know it's going to be

674
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,336
Sitting in a puddle

675
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
Immersed in rain

676
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,224
But I have had it outside during the winter holiday season

677
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,784
And every now and then I do have to reset

678
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
I have to admit my GF eyes

679
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,904
Click on and I have to reset those but

680
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,184
It's pretty good

681
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,256
I wonder if using that plug will

682
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:13,376
Get your over most of the hump here for a from a water-resistant standpoint but maybe some kind of

683
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,680
External cover over it

684
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,472
Derek help do the trick

685
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,288
I mean I keep mine on my balcony so it's covered

686
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Anyway

687
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,104
I have another one outside

688
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,896
I'm on the wall in

689
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,688
Don't think that's covered

690
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,224
And I have it

691
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,552
I mean also be smart like I plug it in and it's facing down

692
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,088
It is very rugged

693
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
It is not a wimpy plug

694
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,928
So basically if water doesn't get into the outlet

695
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
You're fine

696
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,744
Sometimes I wrap it with Saran Wrap

697
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
Can help

698
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
They may not look

699
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,632
The prettiest in this is not at this is a big chunky plug

700
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,680
But that is really

701
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,984
Option we found for you and then

702
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,544
The only other thing we could think of

703
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
Is someone left

704
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,152
Voicemail a couple months back where they use an

705
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,432
Outdoor rated

706
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,712
USB charger for

707
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
Your phone

708
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
What is a skull cap

709
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,320
I got power pack

710
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
The power pack

711
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
Why am I blinking other name

712
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:12,768
What's basically a portable battery that you would use to charge your phone on the go but they repurposed at 4

713
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,912
Charging a webcams article correctly

714
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
Get up there it's similar situation

715
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
So they just

716
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
Charge that in

717
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,080
Brought a cord down and they just plug it right into that

718
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,104
Recharge it

719
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Golang

720
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,664
Recharge the power pack in the

721
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,736
Do it as needed so that's another option for you

722
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
That might work

723
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
Good luck with your wyzecam

724
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
And

725
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
Good luck with

726
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
This particular project

727
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
Okay

728
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
I feel

729
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,976
Like it is time

730
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,560
For us to go and visit the magical bars of

731
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328

It is South by Southwest

737
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,104
We are having a really in-depth conversation

738
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
About data

Privacy and what's going right and what's going wrong

740
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456

00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,424
Last week we talked about the work if arrow is doing with Mitsubishi

747
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,984
And the Pharaohs effort to create a horizontal payment

748
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,592
So Jo do you mind reminding our listeners what it is

749
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:34,176
As you mentioned a pharaoh provides an iot platform that

750
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,480
Simplifies how you connect really anything

751
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:42,880
To the internet we can help you build a business case and take you all the way through roll out and ongoing management as well as data analyst

752
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,416
Customers tell us that

753
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
Pharaoh is the best choice

754
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,024
Experience and developer productivity

755
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,048
A beautiful design

756
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
Easy to use

757
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
Very fast

758
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
Very very

759
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
Secure

760
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,192
So a lot of customers decide that

761
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:01,056
Instead of going to an outside platform they want to build their own hardware and software to connect your devices

762
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,384
But why should customers use a platform instead

763
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,200
Let me answer that from two different perspective

764
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,808
Well every customer and every device is different there's a lot that's in common

765
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
In iot

766
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,368
Overtime that commonality

767
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,160
Becomes better understood

768
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
Better automated

769
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,464
Better integrated

770
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,048
It's what you end up with is actually a platform

771
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,840
And it becomes its own product

772
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,120
What analogy

773
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,448
Is the operating system on a computer and the apps that run on it

774
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
In the early days

775
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
We didn't have a break

776
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,568
Didn't have compilers libraries debugger

777
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
All the modern soft

778
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
Accelerate

779
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:40,224
Development in people had to either write applications to run on the hardware Direct

780
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
Go ahead to build their own topper

781
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,064
Application

782
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,856
The same sort of thing is happening

783
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
It's more complex

784
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
Because it's

785
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,000
It's a different environment that the software is running

786
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,280
That's much more varied

787
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,328
Even harder to build your own

788
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,680
And even if you do it's really hard to keep it portable hard to keep it reliable hard.

789
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,960
Maintain and enhance

790
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,776
And it's something that you have to do from one project

791
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,056
To another

792
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:09,920
We really think that the time has come for it to have its own proper platform layer

793
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
And of course

794
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,248
We on our customers think a pharaoh is

795
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
The best iot platform out there

796
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,344
All right and what is the second perspective

797
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
II

798
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Perspective

799
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,720
Is from going over all the questions that we need to ask

800
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,280
For an iot project actually starts

801
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:28,608
Let me hear the top three the first one and this is critical

802
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
Is onboarding

803
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:34,496
Can the users phone make a fast and reliable connection with the device they want to control

804
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520
With a pharaoh

805
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,312
Simple QR code scan is all at

806
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
Next point is

807
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
Scale

808
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,688
Can the system scale to meet The Man Without loss of quality

809
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,992
Today if there'll has hundreds of thousands of

810
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
The devices in

811
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,808
The field and the service is designed

812
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:54,208
Descale far beyond that I'd like to share is around security is the whole process secure

813
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,000
Immune to Fleet scale attack

814
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,840
Afero provides a VPN like tunnel for your devices

815
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
Regardless of how they connect

816
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,912
And the list goes on but

817
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,728
Most customers find it very costly and time-consuming

818
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,544
To assemble the teams and skills necessary

819
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,824
To build a system

820
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,872
They can successfully address all of

821
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,664
Excellent

822
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,504
Please remind us where we should go to get more information about a pharaoh

823
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,040
Apeiro. IO

824

825
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,112

847
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008

In places where they live

852

Awesome alright

865
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,488
So one of the challenges with the smart home I feel is

866
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:07,584
Everything's really expensive and a lot of us we

867
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Don't

868
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:12,704
The mainstream consumer many of us are probably tinkering nerds who love to play with stuff

869
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,496
But for the normal people

870
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,312
It can be really hard to understand why you might want something

871
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,616
Disconnected and talks back to the internet

872
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152
Lord only knows

873
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,456
So I would like to ask each of you

874
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,736
For a time that

875
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
Smart devices

876
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
Procedure life

877
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:27,808
Or just

878
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Made it better

879
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,952
So the first thing that came to mind for me was my smart thermostat

880
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:40,352
I have an ecobee and whenever we go on vacation my husband I like to travel at we'd totally forget to program

881
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,144
Thermostat into away mode

882
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:47,520
Turn off at the gate every time we're opening up the app and we're setting a thermostat on vacation mode

883
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,080
Which keeps are kitties happy at home

884
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,872
But we don't use too much power either

885
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,944
So I've been doing this for 25 years so

886
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
There's a lot of pain I have to get past

887
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,504
Come up with an answer

888
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,088
I think that

889
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
For me

890
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,928
The value that I can we actually helps me

891
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,744
Is when it brings information that

892
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
Affects me

893
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:13,120
And specifically I mean such as about turning the light on her off lips

894
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
Methadone

895
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,192
Just a minor thing it's about

896
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,752
Maybe knowing the pollutants that are in my house

897
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,336
I think that is something to me this importance of an air sensor

898
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,920
And in technology like that they can help me be more aware

899
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,736
The hidden things that are going on that I don't know about

900
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,320
So I could shamelessly self-promote but

901
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,368
Was told not to do that

902
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,392
You right now

903
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,696
So I'm not going to say my Roomba

904
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,464
But

905
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
Exactly you're onto me

906
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,008
My camera is so I have two little ones at home I have a 7 month old and a three-year-old and

907
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,592
Last night for example I put my three-year-old down and I

908
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,896
Went out and took the dog for a walk and I get a notice

909
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
Application on my phone

910
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,456
Of movement

911
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
And as far as I knew she was

912
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
Completely asleep

913
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,320
Open up the app

914
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,856
Can I look at the camera

915
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,416
And she is sitting on her potty in her room

916
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,488
With the book

917
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
Reading it like a newspaper

918
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,816
Until I

919
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,400
Set my my wife attacks and said you should probably go in and

920
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,680
Take take care of

921
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
So that's a learned behavior

922
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,288
Yes

923
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
That's right

924
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,896
So I have I have two teenage boys at home

925
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,432
16 + 13

926
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
And if you have teenage

927
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,296
Boys in your house then you know that they don't know how to close

928
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,856
They don't know how to close garage door

929
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,392
And they don't know how to lock

930
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
Front doors

931
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
And so

932
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,000
Things that I'm sure have saved my life are

933
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,072
Smart garage door openers and sensors and

934
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,864
Certainly a Smart Lock

935
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
On the front door

936
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:53,472
Don't have the 2 a.m. oh my God is the garage door

937
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
That's a good one

938
00:35:56,032 --> 00:36:00,128
First thing that comes to mind for me as my smart irrigation controller

939
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:04,736
Cuz I have an automation that says if anyone's walking around my backyard after Dark

940
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,040
Like 10 11 12 midnight

941
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,576
Turn on the water

942
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,880
Spray-on recorded send the video to me

943
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
So

944
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:17,536
I've yet to catch someone but I'm waiting for that day all uploaded to Twitter as soon as it happens

945
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,352
That's it that's the kind of automation you're like

946
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,400
Come on

947
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,752
I can't win it happens I want you to call and we'll

948
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
Will put it up on the web

949
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,312
Cuz I think we'd all like to

950
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,616
All right

951
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,896
What I'm noticing is

952
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,432
That a lot of these things

953
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
AR

954
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,736
They're not smart

955
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,808
Their automations there one off

956
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,856
Did they don't work together in

957
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
I think that's

958
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,720
Kind of been the issue that a lot of people have when we're trying to talk about this

959
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
And

960
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:52,096
Alexa Smart Home in the people who like okay yeah and then

961
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
PetSmart

962
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
I really wanted it to

963
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Two Lakes

964
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,216
Assist me somehow in my life

965
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,312
You know I'm I'm thinking about the devices that really make a difference in my life

966
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
Those that do are super smart

967
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,384
And they have a i

968
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
And they're using their data for

969
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
Mybatis

970
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,016
So then the question I have for you guys

971
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,808
Cuz of the consumer that's what I want

972
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,832
I want my life to be

973
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
Easier

974
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
For the most part

975
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
So

976
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,976
Why do businesses want to sell us

977
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
That's what is

978
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
What is your goal in

979
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,072
Getting us to buy bezoar

980
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,096
Building this

981
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,400
Am I can start for that one

982
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,704
You know in the case of tendrils

983
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,984
We work with utility come

984
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,520
And so

985
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:37,920
We've been figuring out how to fine-tune the messages for consumers we know for some folks it's about being a little bit more green

986
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,480
That doesn't resonate with everybody it could be about

987
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,296
Call protect me from a high bill

988
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:48,160
Help me from being surprised but I bill before it's too late or something similar

989
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
Are you at the club

990
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:57,120
That's what you want to think about energy that much that's one of the big takeaways is you know a lot of us in this room might be energy nerds or Gadget

991
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,424
Nerds but that's not the general population it's

992
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
How can we make it happen behind the

993
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:07,104
So the customer gets the best outcome they're comfortable and they're happy with

994
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,688
Do you know using green energy or spending my son their bill but they don't have to work any harder

995
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
The device.

996
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:13,760
So

997
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,296
I want to address the

998
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,320
The question directly

999
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,648
What's the motivation behind people that are building products

1000
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Putting me out there

1001
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,464
Motivation

1002
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,024
Is they want to make money becomes

1003
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,328
Successful in any other things

1004
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,888
I think that the peace that they miss

1005
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,472
And that only very few get is it really is

1006
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,032
About the experience and experience has to be

1007
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,312
Expression freeze pasta

1008
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,616
You mentioned earlier you said these

1009
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,432
The smart switches any smart lights these are these are expensive

1010
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,736
When will you think about expense

1011
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,272
Don't you stop at the Dollar

1012
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:50,112
Think about the time it takes for that to be put in think about the prostration

1013
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,440
When that pickle technology from company a doesn't work the way it's supposed to

1014
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,768
Especially when you find out the product from company a doesn't work

1015
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,792
Maybe

1016
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:01,120
There's a lot of the challenges there that when we talk about the cost

1017
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,400
A bad experience

1018
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
We really

1019
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,496
In general the industry doesn't really think about

1020
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,288
That full-on cost

1021
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,568
And if it's there

1022
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,384
And I think that we need to do a better job of doing that

1023
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:18,272
Sopra my motivation perspective I think the motivation should be to create relationship with customers or Everlasting

1024
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,040
And

1025
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,112
You got to do that by respecting the customers and their time

1026
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,928
I think they think we change that model

1027
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,696
Might get some

1028
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,280
Brighten Hans I want to tweak it just a little

1029
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,304
Are you guys

1030
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
Specifically

1031
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,632
IRobot wants to sell me

1032
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
Robotic vacuums

1033
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,704
Lawn mowers at whatever

1034
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
Karina Washington

1035
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
But

1036
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
Why

1037
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:40,800
Connect it

1038
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,824
What is the real

1039
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,872
2

1040
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,408
Russ and end

1041
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,456
The room has been around since 2002

1042
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,272
So in the world of the smart home that's it

1043
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,808
The pit of a dinosaur

1044
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:58,208
And it took us a while for us to connect our products because the devalue you meet the reason to

1045
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,000
To do so is not immediately clear

1046
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:06,912
What did viking finally convinced the company to do so was it came down to Mission completion so

1047
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,216
Having a connected product for us

1048
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,032
Especially one with that has a vision enabled

1049
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:15,360
Navigation system like the last few iterations of the Roomba

1050
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,896
Enabled us to have

1051
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,688
A higher Mission completion rate

1052
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
Right so

1053
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
Roomba is leaving the dock

1054
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:24,576
It's cleaning the room the area was supposed to and it's coming back

1055
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:27,392
And it's now sending a signal saying we're done

1056
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,696
We didn't have the ability to do that.

1057
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,232
Long time and end and it's

1058
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:37,632
Because it's connected it can get itself out of certain situations and so is a higher there's a higher Mission completion rate

1059
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,912
Great for us and that's

1060
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,472
The ultimate goal from our perspective is its

1061
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,496
Happiness in

1062
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,032
Convenience for the for the cost

1063
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
Yasso

1064
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,128
My company doesn't make devices

1065
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
And our customers

1066
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,712
Are insurance companies they don't make

1067
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,736
SmartThings

1068
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
Right but

1069
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,624
Overtime the bet in the insurance business

1070
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
This is that

1071
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,184
Your data

1072
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,744
Is going to help your insurance company

1073
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,048
Understand how you live in your home

1074
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:10,400
In the same way that an auto telematics insurance companies are learning

1075
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
How you drive in your car

1076
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
And

1077
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
That

1078
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,800
In an auto telematics that has led to

1079
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
Discounting

1080
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,640
Across-the-board there's not an insurance company that

1081
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
Surcharges

1082
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,200
For your telematics

1083
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
So the same thing

1084
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,040
Is going to be made in

1085
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,576
Home telematic

1086
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,880
If you will near-term though

1087
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,440
Insurance companies believe it or not

1088
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
Want to

1089
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,744
Engage

1090
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,280
With their customers

1091
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,096
In an interesting and different way than they ever had

1092
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,400
So they don't really want to lead with a

1093
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,960
The data strategy they want to lead with a

1094
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,776
I've got a consumer that's connected to me

1095
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,056
In a different way

1096
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:55,199
What can I tell them about their home that they don't already know or what can I tell them about how they're living in their home

1097
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,991
That might affect

1098
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,063
How they live how they maintain their home in overtime

1099
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
Are there in

1100
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:06,207
So as an internet service provider we don't make her cell connected devices

1101
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:11,071
But will you get the phone calls when those connected devices are hard to get on the network

1102
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:17,983
Or when they're installed in places that don't have good coverage like outside of your house or in your garage or

1103
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
By your circuit breaker

1104
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:24,639
So what we want to do is simplify that onboarding by working with different partners and two

1105
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:28,735
Different standards and make that really really easy and provide connectivity everywhere

1106
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
Just sew it

1107
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:34,623
What's a better consumer experience we're not going to monetize that are charged for it is just part of

1108
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,159
A great connectivity experience

1109
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,695
So that's really what we're

1110
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
We're looking to do

1111
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
All right

1112
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,815
In one of the topics that we

1113
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
Constantly here is

1114
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,911
Data so the insurance are like hay

1115
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,959
We can get data and then maybe

1116
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,727
We can

1117
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263
Lower your premium

1118
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
Yay

1119
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,567
In an energy

1120
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
Data. My energy use

1121
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
Yay

1122
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:01,247
And my robots example data about the layout of my home so you can avoid getting

1123
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,063
I'm stuck in the same spot every time

1124
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,879
So these all sound good

1125
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,671
But it feels like

1126
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,231
We are not there yet in for the last

1127
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:16,095
I would say four or five years we've been talking about how all of this data is going to come in and

1128
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:21,215
Be magical for me as a consumer but also do something amazing for your bottom line and

1129
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:25,311
I just saw a survey actually that within 5 years

1130
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,151
Certain percentage of corporate Executives and I was really high was like

1131
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,735
70-something percent believe that data is going to be as a line item on

1132
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,015
Their accounting sheet

1133
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
It's like

1134
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,087
Vodafone survey if you guys are looking

1135
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
So

1136
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,415
So what's holding us back from turning this

1137
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,975
Cold hard data into Cold Hard Cash

1138
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
I think

1139
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:48,095
That's so I'll I'll answer as a consumer of these things

1140
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,119
And as of

1141
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
An industry professional

1142
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,935
I think that we lack

1143
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
A

1144
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,007
Clear and compelling value proposition

1145
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,823
I'm across most of the things that we have

1146
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,663
The SmartThings in my house I have because they're cool

1147
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
Write in

1148
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:07,039
They give me something to talk to my 16 year old

1149
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,343
TT kit about right and

1150
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,903
I'm also I think they're going to help me at some point

1151
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:12,927
But

1152
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:16,511
Even still as you said we I have SmartThings but my house

1153
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
It's still pretty dumb

1154
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:22,399
So I think in the absence of a really clear really compelling

1155
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,983
Value proposition it's going to be hard to realize

1156
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,287
Of the true value of the data

1157
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
Commercial

1158
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,663
I would I would actually answer this a little differently

1159
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,735
I would think that it's not Nestle data they wanted contacts

1160
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
Xbone

1161
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,063
And I would say that what context is a picture

1162
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,903
And if you think about a picture any picture look at any picture you look at

1163
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,439
Text made by Sears a pixel

1164
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,511
And we don't have enough pixels degree pictures

1165
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,071
When we talk about the date of this coming

1166
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,375
Often it's a lot of repeated data over time

1167
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:58,495
And it data actually dies on the line it's 99% of that data is actually useless

1168
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:02,847
The moment we look at it and it and we're looking at Trend at so we may see 5 data points

1169
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
Not a lot of pixels

1170
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:07,711
That's just a little bit of motion of Noise Within an environment

1171
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,503
Not only do we have to have a pixel

1172
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,319
We're going to be able to rain some correctly to create the picture

1173
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,623
So we got a long way to go before

1174
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,647
The data

1175
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,183
Nnic Longway

1176
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
Enable

1177
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487
Way to think about

1178
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,767
How fast things are moving

1179
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
Stop that one

1180
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,815
But

1181
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,583
Because

1182
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,863
We don't

1183
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,935
Have those pixels because we don't have that context

1184
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,983
The day that doesn't have value yet

1185
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,263
But that's changing

1186
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,055
There's more more things coming online

1187
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:38,175
Yeah I mean I I generally agree with that but I would we do have the pixels mean a lot there's lots of

1188
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,711
Example of the cameras

1189
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,015
Is lots of cameras ISP cameras

1190
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,831
Rocky cameras I'm sorry are extremely popular

1191
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
They're everywhere

1192
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:51,487
But but what to do with them that the context dit-dit-dit is captured in that stream

1193
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,511
Is lost

1194
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:56,351
It's right and it's so it's in his lots of things you need to know it's what's in this picture

1195
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,655
What's going on what time of day is it

1196
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,727
What's all the things that you need to do that we do

1197
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,007
Naturally

1198
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,311
Right watching my daughter and my son

1199
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:09,407
Learn things right it's it's it's amazing to watch a child

1200
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:12,479
And how they learn and how complex that process is

1201
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:16,575
We're not there yet in terms of the technology in My Mind

1202
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,647
To do that I do think it's coming in

1203
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
Tappening

1204
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,695
In our case

1205
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:26,047
Being able to map the room yes the primary reason is to complete the mission

1206
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:30,143
But now it's we can understand at least the spatial understand spatial

1207
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,679
Context of that home

1208
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,471
The size of that home

1209
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,775
Even what particular rooms are

1210
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,335
That's a layer of information that does add up to that

1211
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,431
So I will uplift that back to you and say I agree with you

1212
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,711
At the local level

1213
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:48,063
You're solving a problem locally to the home and the humans are closest to that Kant

1214
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,367
So they can actually fill in some gaps

1215
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,903
That you wouldn't be able to

1216
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,439
You can mention the word

1217
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,279
We know when you're doing this and you're doing that and you're doing the other thing

1218
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,559
That to me is scary

1219
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,631
I like that Humanity's doing this we are doing this

1220
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,423
Not necessarily that individual data

1221
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,959
Cuz of that individual data

1222
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,543
Has its own challenges of how it's being used because

1223
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:12,895
In Europe gdpr the general data protection regulation has changed the relationship

1224
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,735
Between the data the people have and the people who are trying to take your data from them

1225
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,295
In California the California consumer protection act

1226
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:23,135
It's a trend that's making it so that I own the day that you can't take the dative

1227
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,695
And if you do there's some

1228
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
Sarcastic

1229
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
Work out well

1230
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,559
I would agree with you

1231
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,583
Debt from a local

1232
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,631
Perspective but when you talk about the industry

1233
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,191
And you guys haven't seen the bottom line at the Enterprise level

1234
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:41,567
No it's a much higher view that you got to get and you got to get a lot more generalized 804

1235
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,151
Personalization is

1236
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,431
What makes it useful to

1237
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
Consumers

1238
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:52,831
And so utilities have actually been struggling with this for a long time they've been upgrading their meters

1239
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,135
Two Smart Meters show instead of rolling the truck

1240
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:59,743
Once every 30 days and taking a read They're not reading it every 15 minutes and they struggled

1241
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,279
To prove value to the

1242
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,351
About why it's worthwhile to roll these

1243
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
Things out

1244
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,423
And so they start with just sharing the data with

1245
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,215
The customer says

1246
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,519
Great I used 5 kilowatt-hours last

1247
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,055
Tuesday between 2 and 3 p.m.

1248
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
What is that

1249
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,871
Is that good is that bad

1250
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,407
What should I do with this information

1251
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,759
Let the bass line but then what you have to do is personalizing

1252
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,527
Experience for

1253
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,575
To point out an abnormality

1254
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:30,975
You're using more than similar home there we noticed an unusual P class Tuesday there might be something going on

1255
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:34,047
With your air conditioning unit for example until you have to bring it that

1256
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:34,815
Personal level

1257
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,863
I'm in order to provide.

1258
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,935
There is a trend right now

1259
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:43,775
In the home space for local control in local understanding

1260
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:47,359
And also not sharing your data

1261
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,383
Beyond certain

1262
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
Parties

1263
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,455
So there's that's one trend

1264
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:58,367
But at the same time there's is completely different red where we're like looks like everything I took Google and Alexa

1265
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,391
Without

1266
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,951
People seeming to realize that

1267
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:07,071
When they do that they're actually sharing the data that they were worried about in the first

1268
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,143
I would love for you guys to talk about

1269
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,959
How to communicate with consumers

1270
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,239
What's actually happening

1271
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:21,407
Do we think it's even reasonable are possible or even valuable for consumers to actually own their data as it were

1272
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
I'm very curious

1273
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:30,111
So Stacy and I were talking about a little bit about this earlier I always come back to the example where 5 years ago

1274
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:36,767
Samsung put microphones in its TVs and it CNET did a pig piece on it and it was this big uproar

1275
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,839
Meanwhile Alexa had actually launched

1276
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,607
A couple months ago

1277
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,631
Before that happened

1278
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,423
No one knew what it was yet

1279
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,703
No one cares

1280
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,751
Six months to a year later

1281
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:51,103
They're selling while the time it will now millions of these things

1282
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:56,735
And no one seems to care at all and the reason for that is because people got a basic utility out of

1283
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
What's the device right

1284
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,807
People were worried about Samsung it was less

1285
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,623
I do think that it was over there's a microphone in my house now

1286
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:06,463
The clearly people got over that when they knew they could set a timer listen to music

1287
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,743
So

1288
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:13,631
I do think that there is a certain amount of this that comes back to just what is the utility that the consumed that the customer is getting

1289
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:17,215
But they're also now is it big transparency problem

1290
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:21,311
Where it it could be abused it is being abused we seen it

1291
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:25,663
And I think everyone has to be a little bit more transparent with the user

1292
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,687
About that

1293
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,991
That's a very Company by company

1294
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,295
Right very specific we're not going to sell

1295
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
Your data

1296
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,111
You at we have a map of your home

1297
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,647
It lives on that robot

1298
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
It's not going anywhere

1299
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
We met

1300
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,743
Tell someone

1301
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:44,351
There's something called the kitchen because you may want to be able to turn the lights on your kitchen with Alexa

1302
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
But that's all it would know

1303
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,655
Is that there is a kitchen

1304
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,751
Yeah I agree I think it's all about giving consumers

1305
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:58,175
And then letting them decide and if they choose that they don't want that data shared make it very easy for them to

1306
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,735
Delete that data everywhere that it's been stored

1307
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:05,855
And make it really clear is this date a live on the device or does it also live in some other system

1308
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:11,231
I think I don't know if that's the full prescription of had it like label what the date is but I think

1309
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,559
Is it local or is it cloud and then make it very easy to see it in

1310
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
Delete it

1311
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:20,703
So how are we doing it that today we're late scale of 1 to 10 1 being

1312
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:25,823
Facebook Cambridge analytica we are

1313
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:32,223
Tell Amazon or turning on your light in the following groups and

1314
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:37,343
And also the color scale

1315
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:41,951
I think that my answer to this is that we are very low in that scale

1316
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,767
And I wanted to interject because I needed that

1317
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,303
Follow up

1318
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:53,727
I think I have to agree with you that it's a cost versus value relationship that were trying to evaluate but I think that

1319
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,263
Human beings

1320
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,335
Are are very much driven by whatever

1321
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,871
Their needs are at the time

1322
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:00,895
And

1323
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,735
We'll see like said we we have very short memories with the guard

1324
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
The different things that have

1325
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,087
So you'll see this idea and then there's a there's a

1326
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,623
Concept that we have

1327
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
On the coast

1328
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,255
Dick in any technology that people care about the privacy of their data

1329
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:20,095
And sometimes I think that maybe that is something that we

1330
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,911
Archie holding ourselves because we know what's under the covers

1331
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,191
Other people are like

1332
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:28,287
So what they don't want McDonald's think they got my GPS on my phone that helps me get around

1333
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,567
Tell him make that

1334
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:32,127
Relationship of the value of the cost.

1335
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,711
I agree just to kind of blend the two

1336
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,991
The two topics

1337
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,039
I think you mentioned

1338
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,599
Some of the emerging standards gdpr

1339
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,391
We we need that

1340
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,439
Or we need some of those principles

1341
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,231
And we're a long ways

1342
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,767
From where we need to be

1343
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:49,791
I think

1344
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,863
Consistently reminding consumers that you shared your data

1345
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,887
For this reason

1346
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:58,495
Is is going to be something that has to happen in it and it doesn't happen today

1347
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,311
But I think we also have to harken back to

1348
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,895
2D value proposition

1349
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,431
If I share my

1350
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,479
Fitbit data with my

1351
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,039
Gym because they give me

1352
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,343
50% off of my monthly fee

1353
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,391
I don't have to be reminded of that

1354
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,159
I get it

1355
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:16,927
Right

1356
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,463
And so what's the story

1357
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,535
Answer your question we're not doing a good job today

1358
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
We

1359
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:23,839
The debate we

1360
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,655
But I am optimistic about

1361
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:31,519
I think we're technically checking the boxes just buried in terms and

1362
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,567
Mission but nobody read yes

1363
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,847
Yeah

1364
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,175
And so it's about how do you

1365
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,711
Either directly Tire

1366
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:45,343
Add to Value so customers understand or just say it in plain English or show them the same data that you have access

1367
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,623
Text you that you're sharing and

1368
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,903
How to draw the connection

1369
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
Here's what we have

1370
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,743
Here's what we're using it for here's where you can get a chain

1371
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,791
So there's a user experience

1372
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,607
Add another layer

1373
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
Honest

1374
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
And that is

1375
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:01,983
We're talking about Jada like my actual I turn this light bulb on

1376
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,055
But let's take it up a notch to inference so let's

1377
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,615
Now we're all talking about AI it's very exciting

1378
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,175
Now you might say oh

1379
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,967
When someone turns their light on

1380
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,247
At 3 a.m.

1381
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,527
Consistently

1382
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,599
They probably have insomnia which is associated with

1383
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,135
I'm going to make this up heart attack

1384
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,695
And us there a terrible risk for

1385
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,999
A health insurance company and then suddenly

1386
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,047
We're looking at

1387
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,839
In this is this is

1388
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,607
Morris

1389
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,727
People's fear when they start looking at me like I do not want the naked pictures of me

1390
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,799
Turn my video camera on the web which is totally understandable you

1391
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:40,127
But there's also potential for economic

1392
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:40,895
Harm

1393
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,943
Coming for this and I'm curious

1394
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:46,015
What your take is on that I don't think we're there yet but

1395
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,319
There's a real fear that we get going

1396
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,415
Hollywood Center really good job of scaring us on the sleeves top

1397
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:56,767
If you eat some of these movies I even for the last 20 years it's like

1398
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:02,143
Oldest person has this terrible diseases person has been diagnosed with AIDS for example back in the

1399
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,959
There's a movie it was one of the the

1400
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,495
It's like

1401
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,103
I think the movie was one of the Harrison Ford movies where he was

1402
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,639
And idea was

1403
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,663
That guy was being black

1404
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,967
And I think that's where it comes to

1405
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,759
It's not about your data

1406
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,039
Actually being used

1407
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,319
In the way that you intended to

1408
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,855
It's about as being lost

1409
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,623
Controller

1410
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,415
Gdpr trying to help

1411
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:27,743
Making sure that the people are responsible your good Steward with data

1412
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:31,071
The attendance of that are you have the right to be forgotten

1413
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,375
You can wipe anytime you want do you have the right to

1414
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,399
Opt-out you have

1415
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:37,471
You have more rights than you used to have in control of that data

1416
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:42,591
And the companies that actually on that dead and now there's there's teeth in that because they can be fine

1417
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,615
That's what was

1418
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,383
The missing piece

1419
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,455
Is as far as the energy goes it really does take

1420
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,783
For some degree some negative impact

1421
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,135
There's a lot less products out there if you've ever noticed now that you can bring up

1422
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,695
And they have password is a default password

1423
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,719
When you turn them on

1424
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,279
The reason is because the industry took a shot

1425
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,583
About two years ago from something called Mariah

1426
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,911
That biscuit was looking at all the photos you were out there

1427
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
End

1428
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:11,775
Everybody said we can't be bondable anymore so we got to ship a product that actually has

1429
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,335
Some level of security built into it so you're not

1430
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,639
A victim as soon as you plug the darn thing internet

1431
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,479
The clothes on that I think that the whole point of that is

1432
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,015
The data itself

1433
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,063
And the stewardship of that data

1434
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,343
From when the

1435
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,879
Either take it from you

1436
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,415
Or you share it with them

1437
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,463
And how that that is actually

1438
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,791
Managed in life cycle is extremely important we don't spend enough

1439
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,815
Time talking about that

1440
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,887
Yeah that's right I agree I think

1441
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
Take that

1442
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,215
When we think about who owns today that which is

1443
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,263
The recurring question that comes up

1444
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,055
The consumer has to own it

1445
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,615
And you know your analogy of the

1446
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,663
3 a.m. wake up

1447
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,247
Hits home with us because

1448
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,295
We support the life insurance pays

1449
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:58,367
And sleep is a really big indicator of

1450
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,391
Mortality

1451
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,183
Right and so

1452
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:05,535
We have to be super responsible are guiding principles have to begin with

1453
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,095
Value to the consumer and privacy

1454
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,655
And of course data ownership

1455
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,423
And

1456
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:16,287
They have to know what that's being used for and it has to be in their control to change it

1457
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:20,383
Do you foresee that happening where my smart home data

1458
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:24,479
Starts affecting and I know you said nobody gives you surcharge

1459
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,527
Associated with

1460
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,319
Your data but do you see that

1461
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:31,391
Helping establish new Actuarial tables

1462
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
Pause and

1463
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:38,047
Changing the way people pay for their life insurance based on or health insurance based on their active

1464
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,095
Yeah I think so

1465
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:44,191
So I don't support the health insurance pays that gets really itchy and

1466
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,727
There's a thing called Head Moen

1467
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,287
So that's it that's an independent business but

1468
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:52,383
Life I think so home I think so because

1469
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,967
You know we live in our homes in a very unique way

1470
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,735
And

1471
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,319
In a world where we all sort of

1472
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:03,647
Hunger for cheaper insurance rates Home Auto

1473
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,695
Life commercial what have you

1474
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:09,535
If there is a compelling story

1475
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,815
Actuarial

1476
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
Story

1477
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,399
Around how you live in your home and what that means

1478
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,679
To the

1479
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,959
The premium you pay

1480
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
Then

1481
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,263
I think it's going to matter

1482
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:24,127
I think it's going to take time this isn't next year this might not even be 5 years from now

1483
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,407
Right but

1484
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,991
There is a story to tell and I think it's even broader than

1485
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,527
Just your connected home

1486
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,063
Your connected car is

1487
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,855
Is actively interacting with

1488
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,623
With your home

1489
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,159
And with your Fitbit

1490
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,183
And

1491
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,231
Those are threaded together

1492
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,255
Paint

1493
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:44,095
A vivid three-dimensional picture of who you are as an insurance risk

1494
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:48,703
Right but that's how we have to be thinking about this as sort of

1495
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,495
Data and insurance vision

1496
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,543
You're scared to death

1497
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,359
This is it from Meijer to paper in my sink

1498
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,639
To test smoke alarm

1499
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,711
So I can tell you my insurer is going to be like oh no

1500
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,503
No

1501
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:06,367
I saw a compelling demonstration at CES of a company

1502
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,903
It did something very simple

1503
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,439
They put motion sensors

1504
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:13,535
In the major areas if it one of the better in the Twin the living room all the world in motion sense

1505
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,863
And over a period of two months

1506
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,143
They plotted the motion

1507
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,423
In the spaces overtime

1508
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,519
And there's for example a very clear indication when you have an ulcer

1509
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,799
Somebody approaching Alzheimer

1510
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,079
Because

1511
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,615
They're up in the middle of the night

1512
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:30,687
And because they're randomly going from room to room

1513
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,991
Something you wouldn't know without being a measure that

1514
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,551
But you take that back around 2

1515
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:38,879
The things that you're doing from from the insurance of the home because

1516
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,415
Now you have a

1517
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,463
A challenge to the safety of the home

1518
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,767
Now you have a challenge to the health of the individual

1519
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,303
It's a very real

1520
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:50,911
And you can do it without invading the Privacy you don't have to have cameras focus on everything is there

1521
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,703
You just have to intelligently

1522
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:55,007
Look at the the cause and effect

1523
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,567
Of different conditions that you want to

1524
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,383
Who do you tell that I have all time

1525
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,431
Haven't told anybody yet

1526
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,015
Alright let's talk about

1527
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:10,111
When we buy the stuff cuz you mentioned terms and conditions and how they're not awesome

1528
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,159
I thought those were not your exact

1529
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,695
What I'm saying

1530
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,511
So

1531
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:23,167
What are some ways we can do to communicate with people who are busy and who did not I mean we all know that no one's going to read this.

1532
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,495
How they've been talked about nutrition labels for data but

1533
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:33,151
What are some ideas that are percolating in your industry about how to talk to people in create these value prop

1534
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,431
Positions and how we talk

1535
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,199
And use about

1536
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:35,967
Use your data

1537
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:41,343
It could be as simple as if you have some sort of

1538
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,647
App for email that goes out to customers

1539
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,671
Use your smart

1540
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,439
Tobias

1541
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,743
You show them the data that they have

1542
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:52,095
And then you give them some useful information about it some sort of inside that they wouldn't have already

1543
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,423
That they wouldn't have gotten without this device in their home

1544
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,703
So for example

1545
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:01,567
Maybe how they use energy across the course of the day or what their average set point is and how it compares to

1546
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,847
Dissimilar homes

1547
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:09,247
And in just plain English say you know this is how we know this this is what we do with your data and here's where you can

1548
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,111
I agree with that I think it's still in the context

1549
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:14,879
Best of

1550
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,183
Or tying it the some way to

1551
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,463
Back to the value back to the

1552
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:22,047
Ikea is an example of the things that we're doing with this

1553
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,351
You mentioned I think you know repeating

1554
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,423
Repeating at some Cadence in a

1555
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
Relatively

1556
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:35,871
Friendly kind way that this might be something that you're doing with it and just and just that just just reminding them of that

1557
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:41,759
My remote might give me like an outline of my house or something

1558
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,295
A map of my house

1559
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:51,231
Yeah no absolutely right and end and I get the kitchen example that I that I mentioned right the newest Roomba

1560
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,255
Does do that

1561
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,279
For you and you can

1562
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,303
It will

1563
01:01:55,327 --> 01:02:00,191
In the app you will see a layout of whatever space that it was clean it will then

1564
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:03,519
Start a label those rooms you have the power to label those rooms

1565
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:06,079
It just simple things like that

1566
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:09,919
Right and we're getting there to the point where the context up well if it's

1567
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:14,271
The kitchen we know that we should probably clean that more often because that's where there's more messes

1568
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:19,135
Where the kids are in the kids room or the playroom or whatever it is and just those little nudges

1569
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,439
At the same time or just building credibility

1570
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:24,255
Right it's a it's really a credibility thing in the transparency

1571
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:31,679
I think in addition to showing what data is being collected I think it should be required in the technical

1572
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,703
Full specs the list

1573
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:38,847
All of the data collection abilities you have so if you build a microphone in your product you have to list there's a microphone

1574
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,431
Warren air quality sensor every sensor that collects data

1575
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,991
I've listened to and here's the type of data it collects

1576
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,551
Yeah we didn't we talk about this

1577
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,111
Sephora but I think it gets did to those sort of when your

1578
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,647
Actually making physical product

1579
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,207
Chrissy mention this on your pocket

1580
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
I'll plug your

1581
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,119
Italy it if you're creating physical devices in the home

1582
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:04,703
This has to start even if it's a software device that is software product

1583
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,983
This has to start

1584
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,055
It has to be a basic Foundation of basic building block

1585
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:12,127
Of the concept development process in the product development process

1586
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,407
Cuz if it's not

1587
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,943
That is never going to happen

1588
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,223
Regulation

1589
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,527
You could step in but we need to be better than

1590
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,623
As I mentioned we work with Wellness

1591
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:26,975
We work at Mayo Clinic the Cleveland Clinic with a lot of medical experts and weed

1592
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,023
Are in the commercial and unplugging

1593
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,071
Al commercial Hospitality in the resident

1594
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,119
Sector there's a lot of data to be gathered

1595
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,655
So I think that the

1596
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,983
Way to think about this is is to change the storage

1597
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,007
Just a little bit from us

1598
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,031
Mentality

1599
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,055
Imagine

1600
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,847
But I'm not just sharing my data

1601
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,895
Imagine that there's somebody

1602
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,967
That is an employee of mine in Henrietta off to them

1603
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,759
What would I expect of them

1604
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:54,111
Brexit to give the data and then run and go do stuff with it and then just tell me you're going to give it to me

1605
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:54,879
I'm gone

1606
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,927
Now we expect to have reports back

1607
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,487
How that data is actually doing good

1608
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,535
How the date is actually being used

1609
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:04,095
Soaked to the point of yeah this will do this

1610
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:04,863
No no

1611
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,399
This is also doing

1612
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,959
I think that's the big piece that's missing is

1613
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:11,775
How that data is actually transforming other people's lives

1614
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:16,639
There's a there's a big opportunity for that transparency to carry through the life cycle of a

1615
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,199
I want to ask you

1616
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,735
Again

1617
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,807
Where are we on the spectrum of actually

1618
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,343
Communicating this back to the

1619
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,111
Customer

1620
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:26,879
In

1621
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,927
Creating dispositive

1622
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:31,743
Feedback loop where would we have this

1623
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,023
You're getting this out of it

1624
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:36,095
I would say even in creating music.

1625
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:38,143
Everyone I talked to has this great

1626
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,191
Warm and fuzzy Vision but

1627
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:45,311
Really the only thing I hear about is like how Facebook's using my stuff to like sell ads delay

1628
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,079
Nazis are

1629
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,407
That's pretty scary

1630
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,015
I think that

1631
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:57,343
Turd for my company we struggle because

1632
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,647
People don't care that much about energy

1633
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,439
Great at the end of the day like

1634
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:04,511
If the lights turn on and my bills not too high

1635
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,815
It's it's really it's like not a type of

1636
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,375
And so

1637
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:16,031
I think we do a pretty good job communicating everything that's available it's just how do you engage customers on those

1638
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:20,639
As meaningful insights that we derive from the data so they understand why it matters and we're not just

1639
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,919
Chain for Dontae

1640
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
Exactly

1641
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:32,159
Exactly so we work with utilities who

1642
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,207
Have incentives to either reduce

1643
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:38,303
System and overall or pull it out of certain high peak times to pray

1644
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,839
Prevent blackouts herb

1645
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,375
Firing up at Peak planners

1646
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,423
Something like that so there is a massive

1647
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:49,055
Impact to the world for us doing this just had to get customers to care

1648
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:53,151
And make it a compelling value proposition

1649
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:53,919
Searching for them

1650
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:57,503
Individual a so much so that they'll opt into the program

1651
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:02,623
Because usually the the feel-good message that it's good for the world isn't enough for somebody to sign

1652
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:06,975
There's a sensitive data point that we all carry around with us today

1653
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:10,303
That existed long before smarthome that's our credit score

1654
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,327
And

1655
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,351
We all I think

1656
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,399
Hold our credit score near and dear to us

1657
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:17,471
And we guard it we want to know if and when and how it's used

1658
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:21,055
But we don't always know if and when and how it's used

1659
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,079
But

1660
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,383
It's governed in a

1661
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,431
Very rigorous way

1662
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,735
And I think a way that smart home data should be

1663
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:31,551
And anytime your credit score is used

1664
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,879
Bit to make a loan or an insurance transaction or

1665
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,415
In your utility

1666
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,719
Transaction I don't know if credit scores use

1667
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:44,351
And a decision is made using that using your credit score you have to know about

1668
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,143
The

1669
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:51,007
The business that used it has to tell you that they used it you have to give consent

1670
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,823
And then if an adverse decision was made

1671
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,847
In the use of that

1672
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,383
Then a letter has to go out

1673
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:58,943
And you had you have the ability to

1674
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
Respond to that

1675
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,271
So there may be some lessons to be learned

1676
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,295
From

1677
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,111
That one datapoint that none of us want to give up

1678
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,159
Right and

1679
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,183
And use

1680
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
Everyday

1681
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,231
Let's

1682
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,255
Take a trip

1683
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,279
Back in time

1684
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:18,655
And I am curious what you guys many of y'all have been in the industry for a really long time

1685
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:23,007
What would you change or would you change how we're developing

1686
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:24,543
Maybe it's

1687
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:28,639
What would you change your how would you like to see an idealized rollout

1688
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:31,455
At the smart home and like how we talk about the stuff at

1689
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,223
Communicated

1690
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,295
What's your I can jump in

1691
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,831
So I think

1692
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
Standard

1693
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,623
Protocol

1694
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:44,255
So that third-party apps who want to talk to all these devices have a standard integration

1695
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,023
Mission paw

1696
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,839
If I could go back in time that's what I would ask for

1697
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,143
Because we integrate with

1698
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,423
All the different thermostat

1699
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,959
And all of them have did

1700
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,983
Different apis

1701
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,031
But have different levels of control

1702
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,847
That change from time to time and it's

1703
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,175
You know a full-time job just to keep up with all that stuff

1704
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,711
Princess and standardization

1705
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,759
I know

1706
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,111
It's created opportunity

1707
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
Brothers 2

1708
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:18,815
Yeah I mean it and I guess the question I have is this how much of this is a wish list a true wish list right cuz I I completely agree but without

1709
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,839
Getting into the details of

1710
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,375
The prisoner's dilemma another

1711
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:25,215
Game Theory like there's a lot of reasons why that didn't happen and

1712
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:28,543
And why that also enabled us to get to where we are

1713
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,335
Right even though it is messy and

1714
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,871
Manassas technology

1715
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,407
Write it it it it

1716
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:36,991
It rarely ends up rolling out in a very clean

1717
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:40,319
Way initially and it takes longer than you expect

1718
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,623
But when it does arrive

1719
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,647
It usually

1720
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,671
Write the meaning

1721
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,951
Progress is progress

1722
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,279
I would say if we went back in time

1723
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,095
To all Implement security by Design

1724
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,631
So implement

1725
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:57,471
The online security from the very beginning so we don't have all these data

1726
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:01,311
I still worried that if we don't get her act together people

1727
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,615
Will just get turned off to the whole technology

1728
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,919
So we really need to address that

1729
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,455
So

1730
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:10,527
I think that it all starts in the education system

1731
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,343
I think personally we jump the shark

1732
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:19,999
When a company put a product in and labeled it programmable thermostat and put it in the shelves of the mass mark

1733
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,023
Stores

1734
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,327
That's not the value proposition of the

1735
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,095
Consumer

1736
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:27,679
So if we took the engineering guys and we force them

1737
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:31,007
To learn about consumer experience and N2 understand

1738
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:34,847
That's the most important thing and you need to go backwards from that

1739
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,199
If we gave them jobs 101c Jazz 101 Smule Theory there

1740
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,991
I think that might change

1741
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:44,063
That the relationship between people and Technology

1742
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:44,831
That

1743
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,855
Today

1744
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,135
Nanotechnology

1745
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
6 way down here

1746
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,439
Fundamentally and people

1747
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
Bose speaker

1748
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:54,047
We're Bridging the Gap a little bit never falling back and then I think that we just

1749
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,327
How to divide between the

1750
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,863
People that are making the technology

1751
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,143
And the people that are using the

1752
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:03,519
To be fair the guy that created the nest was a Steve Jobs disciple

1753
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,895
Toni wasn't quite a disciple

1754
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,991
Cannabis

1755
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,527
All right everybody

1756
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:21,183
Please big round of applause for us

1757
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:27,583
And a big thank you to our sponsors and hosts

1758
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:35,263
Thank you this is great discussion preciate everybody coming for the sand

1759
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,591
I am sure these payments are going to hang around for a while if you want to

1760
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,615
Interact with them

1761
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,151
Also in terms of the

1762
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,431
The co-host

1763
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,479
Just wanna make sure everybody knows that

1764
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:47,807
Their effects from Gentex here raise your hand if you're from Gentex

1765
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:52,927
Perhaps you saw their only connect them over here which is really amazing what's a good

1766
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,999
Example of something really useful to use

1767
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,535
4 home control

1768
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:01,375
Some of you may know resideo to the

1769
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,911
Residential alarm

1770
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,191
What was Honeywell

1771
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,519
Is moving headquarters in the process of moving their headquarters to Austin

1772
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,287
How much is awesome

1773
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,591
Also Schlage

1774
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,639
Is here Devin from Schlage

1775
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:15,199
He is here and all the

1776
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,503
Noemi says we call them from you know me

1777
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,039
Raise your hands

1778
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:19,807
Is a few of us here

1779
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:24,159
So if you want to interact with any of these people or any of the sponsors

1780
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,463
Bars going to be open for a while

1781
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,487
Make yourself at home
