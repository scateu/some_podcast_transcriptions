Shake It Off

56
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
What a Sad start to this week

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
I know

58
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
In

59
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Mandt

60
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,200
So stringify we got it we got an email all of the people who use string of

61
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,016
By which is a software-based program that allowed you

62
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040
2

63
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,600
Basically they called him flows

64
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
These really complicated recipe

65
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
PS4 iot

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Devices

67
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,256
I used it a lot to create things like

68
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
I had

69
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
The ability to tell Google or

70
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
My Amazon Echo

71
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
Yoga time

72
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
And what would happen if

73
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,424
Is my

74
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,216
Shades would come down

75
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
My lights went dim

76
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
Television would turn on Socastee

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
I do yoga

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,432
So all of this happened and my air conditioning would actually go.

79
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
Is hot yoga Is For Fools

80
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,320
So all of that would happen just with the words yoga time

81
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
Time it was

82
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Awesome

83
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
And now I can no longer have you

84
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,256
Will you can have yoga time but you won't have yoga time with stringify

85
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
When Comcast

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
Purchase

87
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
Stringify

88
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
And this was about 80

89
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
Yes

90
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
We said

91
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
Caprichos both of us that said

92
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
When do they shut it down

93
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
Play makes sense

94
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,848
Comcast what is stringify

95
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Because

96
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
I have complicated feelings about Comcast

97
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
But when it comes to the Smart Home

98
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
They're doing

99
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Bang up job

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
Creating

101
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,064
A really good interface

102
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
For people to use in

103
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
Stringify help them get that

104
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
This is what they're X1 platform right

105
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes there

106
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
Xfinity home

107
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
X1

108
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
They all have the same

109
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
Games

110
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,727
In Comcast is actually doing a three-front a job there approving Wi-Fi

111
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,519
And they're doing a good job without with

112
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,567
Improving security

113
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,383
Excited about your new security services for

114
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
Connect devices and their improving

115
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,223
Their voice interface with

116
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Set the X1 platform

117
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Yeah

118
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
It got all of that

119
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
Stringify means

120
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:50,047
It did and I know we have people that listen to this podcast we're very passionate about stringify and love it and I guess

121
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
It's it's great

122
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
I lean towards

123
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,167
If this then that personally but the same concept

124
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:00,799
And it provides a valuable service for you to connect things that are not otherwise natively connectable

125
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
My butt

126
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
To be fair

127
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:09,247
I don't think a massive amount of people are going to be affected by this CS again people here Elizabeth show probably

128
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Fairmount

129
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:15,647
But we looked at what was it the download numbers for the stringify app compared to the If This Then That app

130
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
And what do we find

131
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
We found

132
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Very sad

133
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,511
So the stringify app

134
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,815
By the way you guys the stringify app

135
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
Is no longer there

136
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
Did the cash version

137
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
For March 30th

138
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
We saw that it had

139
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
Over a hundred thousand

140
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Switch actually surprise me

141
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
But if

142
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
Has over 5 million

143
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Downloads

144
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
It is in the Google Play Store

145
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,551
Lot of people using this more people than I anticipated but not quite as many as you know a super star break

146
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
So it makes sense that Comcast would

147
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
Be like yeah we don't need to stop

148
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,463
And if you have your stringify flows

149
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,023
Those are going to be available to you until June

150
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
And then they're going to die

151
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
So I guess I have you a good time till

152
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,655
Which kind of leads into 2

153
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
Related topic

154
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
Extra questions

155
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,007
What do you do where do you go

156
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,311
Instead of stringify like we can tackle that first

157
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,359
Then the second question is

158
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,199
How do you get your stuff out of stringify and the easy answer is

159
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
You really don't

160
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,575
I hate to say it and there needs to be a new and I see we've been talking about this

161
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
For the past couple days

162
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
All of these

163
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
Routine type platforms

164
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,767
Are built on standards to a point because they're using

165
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,863
The available apis for all of these devices and hugs and such

166
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
2

167
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,679
And they put up a nice interface

168
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
Front of them and make them work together

169
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
So

170
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
Those are out there and available for anybody

171
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
But

172
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,919
The interphase part there's no import there's no export so it's not like you can

173
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,527
Get those routines out and moves away from stringify to an if this then that person

174
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
So yes you have to

175
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,415
You have to say to yourself I am prepared to spend another few hours

176
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,743
Taking all the things I did on stringify and moving it over to another

177
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,327
It is unfortunate I would love for the industry to come up

178
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
With

179
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,679
Because he's are all API calls are most of these are API calls it does

180
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
Make a challenging but I would love for them to come up with

181
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
Looks like a file format where

182
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,591
Pull these API calls and be like hey

183
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
I want the same thing to happen

184
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
In this new play

185
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,503
Some people might just shrug and be like that's what you get for being an early adopter

186
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,599
I think it also will help with things like vendor lock-in

187
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,927
So I've had people ask me there like God are you worried that you know

188
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,279
If you adopt Google then you can adopt Amazon later and I

189
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Like actually I have

190
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
But I see

191
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Super

192
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,191
Options if you're asking if I use Arduino

193
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
If this then that

194
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
Would you say node-red is another potential option

195
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,335
Yeah actually know red would be

196
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Interested now

197
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,919
You have to run node red on a

198
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
So you still

199
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
They put on a Raspberry Pi or something

200
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
Yes you have

201
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
You can't just like be like

202
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Go to the web

203
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
You can't just have your phone

204
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
There's no node red app for your phone

205
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
That's going to be a little bit of an issue

206
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
In there a lot of

207
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
Things like that out

208
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,423
They're so you can run that on a Raspberry Pi and that has

209
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
Very similar

210
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,775
Flow-based it's two ways you like run things around and

211
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
Oh no

212
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Bad

213
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,015
The Raspberry Pi is your typical device that you would run node red on cuz a pie in the most you can spend on your Raspberry Pi like $35

214
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,831
You can run it locally you can actually have a

215
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,903
Create a Docker container if you have a Linux machine you could do it there

216
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
You can

217
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
Do it with

218
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
An Arduino or a

219
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
Beaglebone black

220
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
Or if you use

221
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,119
And I know a lot about be familiar with us but I've used it before

222
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,191
The termux app in Android

223
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,519
Which is basically a terminal emulator you could run it there

224
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
Or

225
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
If you were like me and

226
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
Gravitating towards the crack cloud

227
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,687
You can put on IBM Cloud sent Technic

228
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Fred

229
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
Never heard of that

230
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,295
Amazon web services or Microsoft azure

231
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
What's right I got a check for that after the

232
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,927
So you had a lot of options but nobody like you said says no like

233
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,231
App to download to your phone and just get going

234
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
So

235
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,839
And in that same day there a lot of other platform

236
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
So you could use it or not

237
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
Read so you can use openhab

238
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,215
You could use home assistant

239
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
You could use

240
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Homebridge

241
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
And all of those are

242
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,407
Open source base programs that let you download their

243
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,223
Trolls basically to a Raspberry Pi

244
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Blink all that up

245
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,575
And like stringify these are actually incredibly

246
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,367
Create all sorts of

247
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
But

248
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Directions

249
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,767
I I find myself in some way

250
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
I'm Paralyzed by

251
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,607
You don't like all my God there's so many features

252
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
Like you can see sensors and your devices that

253
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
Even the manufacturer

254
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,079
Yeah it gets down to how a how technical you want to get like

255
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,663
If you want to get into building things with HTML and JavaScript

256
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
And you're comfortable with that

257
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
Yeah I know right can do that for you at work

258
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
Can offer that to you

259
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
But you can be tinkering a lot

260
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
How do you know if same width

261
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
The other is that you

262
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,159
You know you mentioned you're going to be tinkering

263
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,743
This is not none of these are like a cortical off-the-shelf solution

264
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
But those are the off the shelf

265
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Shirley software-based

266
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,607
The same way that stringify was

267
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,191
Would be something like you know me yonomi

268
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
They have a software platform

269
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:24,127
It doesn't have as much granularity but it is really easy to use and the cool thing about you know me is you can

270
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Actually

271
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
Run the app

272
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,735
It'll discover a lot of the devices at your house

273
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,807
And will actually automatically start suggesting

274
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
Recipezaar floser

275
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,903
Apps that lets whatever you want to call them

276
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
For you using the particular devices

277
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
Since you have which

278
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
I think is really used

279
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,583
I like that a lot that that starts getting this

280
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,447
Putting the smart in the smart home and it's only got mad amazed been doing with the the hunches

281
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
Yes although I haven't seen her

282
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,103
No and I'm home all the time I couldn't let me out so I'm shocked

283
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Do you know

284
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,455
I'm pretty I have a very repeatable process between

285
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:04,063
Coffee writing naptime Netflix and so on so I don't get it

286
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,391
Yeah and I haven't gotten guard either I signed up for the beta program

287
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:14,815
None of them have happened for me that's where the echo will listen for broken glass as a security feature

288
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,631
Yes okay if that was a little Segway Sino

289
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
That wasn't a Segway

290
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,823
A day in the life of Stacy and Kevin

291
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,175
Bats you so other than you know me there is everybody's favorite if

292
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Which

293
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
We actually talked about

294
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
Fairly recently there's some

295
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,343
Turmoil ifft leadership changes that sort of

296
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Think so

297
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
I still say they get bought

298
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Yeah yeah

299
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,999
I say they get bought by a Google or Amazon

300
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
We'll see

301
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
So if this

302
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,863
Still a good option it is

303
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
Not you can't do the multi-pronged

304
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Applets you

305
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
You have to do everything into

306
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
If it really so it's not as powerful

307
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
And then

308
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,847
If you're a SmartThings user you could actually build

309
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,895
Your own apps for some of the stuff

310
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
Ann Dunham Google

311
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
Oh you're groovies cuz

312
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
Groovy language

313
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,927
And if you're an Amazon Echo or a Google home user

314
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
Could actually build some routines

315
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
And

316
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
Uses for voice control the cool thing about

317
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
The

318
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
Stringify thing was they didn't actually

319
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
They have to be based on voice

320
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Json

321
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
Voice but they could have been based on

322
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Jamaica Center trick

323
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
We are any trigger event

324
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,383
You can't get if your home cat though you can use sensors as a

325
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
For certain

326
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
Because I believe the column automations in the home app

327
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Automation

328
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
So many so many

329
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
Okay

330
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439
So those are your alternatives

331
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,535
In just we wrote it I wrote a post about this on the site I said that

332
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
Stringify

333
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
And

334
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,399
The post earlier this week about

335
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,471
People being like we can't recommend the wink Hub anymore which

336
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
Kevin and I are also

337
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Little cautious about the

338
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,359
I said this was the end of the Wild West era

339
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
In

340
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,991
Just put that in perspective I thought I really did I really thought back in 2012

341
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
When we started this that

342
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
You were going to be able to pull Lake

343
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,671
Sensors and outlets and connected devices and in the create your own stuff with

344
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Kind of like Yahoo

345
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Pipes

346
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
Yes

347
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:25,375
But just just build your own experiences in a way that was pretty easy in

348
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
I'm pretty

349
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Reliable

350
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
That never happen

351
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,823
Yeah I mean because things are getting siloed unfortunately

352
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
To the different platforms

353
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:41,503
There is still the the open-source options that you mentioned and mainstream people are not going to likely

354
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,063
Get a Raspberry Pi install openhab or something like that

355
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,647
But your vision but you had in 2012

356
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,743
Is available to people if they want to put the time and effort into it

357
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Yeah I just thought I'd be more

358
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,143
It is available to everyone but not everybody wants

359
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,215
To invest the time and Technical knowledge and learning

360
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
To do it yeah I was hoping

361
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,591
I was hoping you'd be the kind of like creating a Wix or Squarespace

362
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
That's where we are

363
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
That's a lot of talk about that

364
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,855
Let's move on Google is having its

365
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
Cloud next event

366
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
This week which

367
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,951
Where it talks about all the cool stuff happening

368
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
Google Cloud universe

369
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,583
In the iot space Google is

370
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:33,983
Decidedly behind Amazon and Microsoft when it comes to hosting different Enterprises in

371
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
Building iot things

372
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
However

373
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,103
Google has taken that weakness and turn it into boom

374
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Strength

375
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Very jiu-jitsu

376
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
They announced anthos

377
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,319
Which is Google clouds new platform that let you run a nap anywhere

378
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,391
And it is using Open Standards

379
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
It lets you run your

380
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,767
Apps in Google Cloud Amazon Cloud Microsoft cloud and

381
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
It also pulls it down to the

382
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
The Edge and it does that

383
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
With that support for kubernetes which is

384
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
An open-source

385
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
Management platform

386
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
I don't really want to get too into the weeds here

387
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
But yeah

388
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,687
Liquid with a smart thing as you said they took a weakness and turn it into a strength

389
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
Basically anthers

390
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
Innocence becomes your Cloud management platform

391
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,855
Regardless of the cloud you use or

392
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Where it is

393
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
It doesn't even have to be in the cloud

394
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,279
Yes that's correct it could be hybrid Cloud yes absolutely so you could have

395
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,607
And it nap something last year the Google offered by play some Google

396
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,423
They brought kubernetes to on-prem or on-site

397
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
So you could actually have

398
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:42,335
Have your stuff in the cloud and you could have her stuff locally or have redundancy between local and

399
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
Cloud and saucer worth

400
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:48,735
But now they be silly put like I a cloud management layer on top of

401
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,807
Everybody's Cloud which is really smart

402
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,927
And what that does if you're a developer or you're an it a business decision maker

403
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,279
You can literally go to One dashboard one portal

404
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,095
And manage or subscribe to

405
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,655
Move from one Cloud to another

406
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
In one place yours

407
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
Support is there for all of your class you are

408
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:14,335
Billing is there for all of your closet doesn't matter if you use Google or not

409
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Cloud

410
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
And

411
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,943
That is really really smart my opinion of Google

412
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:25,087
Yeah you know I last year when I was at Microsoft build conference which actually build will be in a

413
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Weeks in May

414
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,671
But I thought Microsoft was going to

415
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,743
This I thought Microsoft was going to create this overarching

416
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,791
Multi-cloud management system

417
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,095
Both at the cloud and at the edge

418
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:41,983
Because of their support for kubernetes and some of the things they were doing with things called that cubelets

419
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
Which where

420
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,543
Kubernetes for managing container

421
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
Containerized software

422
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,407
So maybe we're going to see Microsoft launched something like this in a cup

423
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
And that would be

424
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
Yeah maybe

425
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,527
It would be interesting I think

426
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,415
Google certainly knows they're behind and they would love for people to come to Google Cloud for everything I get it

427
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,743
Microsoft's obviously one of the biggest players here

428
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
Repeating mostly against

429
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Amazon

430
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
So

431
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
I don't know if Microsoft needs

432
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
Do that's what Google is doing

433
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,959
They might just to say we can do that too

434
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
The reason the world is going to end

435
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Need this

436
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
Is

437
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
Cuz

438
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
In a business setting

439
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
You're not just going to have your cloud

440
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,503
How to manage like if you think of like a Supply Chain management thing

441
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,367
You're going to have other people you're going to want to see data and run applications

442
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,671
That tie back to your business

443
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
On other

444
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Peoples

445
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
It infrastructure

446
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Infrastructure

447
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
Yeah actually me

448
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:43,679
Maybe the movie infrastructure savings or something

449
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,983
I see this actually be really important

450
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
And it could

451
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,823
Zach Edwards tell me about containers which are

452
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
Are easily Deployable like

453
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,407
Basically applications using only

454
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,991
Imagine you can just throw an application on

455
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
One of your

456
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
Suppliers

457
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,879
Edge so you can monitor what you need to

458
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,207
Having that management layer becomes really essential

459
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,279
It might make sense just not just as Google turn in

460
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:15,167
Weakness into a strength but also because the world were going to live in to Manza in this actually would be better than like

461
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:15,935
Pulling like 8

462
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,959
Ati's and that's worth

463
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,007
Secure

464
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
Customization

465
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Control

466
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:28,479
A lot of flexibility yes struggle with like

467
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,783
Maintaining them making shirts

468
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
Like communicating with people about like

469
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
What's going to go down

470
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
I don't know

471
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,743
So I think this is a really big deal and it's a really big shift and

472
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
It'll be very important

473
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,815
For all these companies were like

474
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,911
I'm going to use iot to make my everything better

475
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,983
Yeah and just to mention a couple companies of

476
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
We're partners

477
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
Spanish for this

478
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
Platform anthes

479
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,711
Google has enlisted some of the usual suspects but now I'm something that surprised me as well VMware and Dell

480
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
They they are very often

481
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,063
Google Partners as well as partners with the other cloud services

482
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
Hpe

483
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
Intel and Lenovo

484
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
It's not like they have

485
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
Small no-name company set of

486
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,023
Glommed onto this so

487
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,607
Yeah that's what you're going to need if you're going to if you're going to succeed with us

488
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:17,887
That's a good start

489
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
Next up

490
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,287
We're going to be talking about a collaboration between Sonos and Ikea B

491
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
Furniture store

492
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,359
And the smart speaker

493
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Company

494
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,431
The connected Speaker Company have launched a

495
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,991
Well-to-do speakers one

496
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,783
Is a bookshelf speaker

497
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
That is about 99 bucks

498
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
Electrolux

499
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,439
It's pretty good. The other is $179 table lamp

500
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
That is also a smart speaker

501
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,767
And it

502
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
It's ugly

503
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,839
It yet

504
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:53,471
It's it's typical Ikea design one color I could live with the other color that's going to be available in August I could not

505
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
So but

506
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,055
It's $179 for the

507
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,895
Lamp that has the speaker built-in and it's 99 for the

508
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,223
Connected bookshelf speaker which definitely looks nice and

509
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
I don't know it sounds like that because

510
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
But

511
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:13,951
It probably sounds so it probably doesn't mean if they work with Sonos I'm sure there was some kind of specifications and tuning and so on

512
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
The strange thing is

513
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,791
They're kind of dumping he's a smart speaker

514
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,399
But there's no microphones built in so I thought originally like

515
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,191
Maybe I could replace one of the

516
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,031
You dozens of smart speakers I have in the house like a Google home

517
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
Mini

518
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,335
With this lamp

519
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
Because it's a smart speaker

520
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,431
But there's no microphones built into either one of these

521
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,527
Yeah and that's because Ikea was worried about

522
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
Turning off privacy phone

523
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:44,415
People and I think when they call it a smart speaker they're talking about it as a connected

524
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,999
Again we're getting connected and Sonos I mean

525
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,327
I have Sonos speakers since like 2007

526
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,143
They weren't smart they were just connected but basically

527
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,983
They're connected the internet so they can play your Spotify or Pandora

528
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Ever so that's what

529
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
They're talking about their

530
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,567
I'm not on board with this person

531
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,895
I'm about to go into a new house and it's

532
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,943
Could be rented so I can see picking up a

533
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
A couple I mean I loved so

534
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
Sonos speakers that sound great

535
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
Work really well

536
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
So

537
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,464
I've been making a big push to add like they added Amazon's voice Services last year and this year they're

538
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
The waiting on it

539
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
One day soon

540
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,888
We supposed to be last year they're supposed to add to Google Assistant support but they haven't done that yet that's in the works

541
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,216
So it's weird to me like they're making this big push and yet

542
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,264
Bucyrus Brandon

543
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,640
Speakers won't stream and Ikea you know they've done kind of their own path with

544
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,968
Stuff so it's possible that this is

545
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
What people want

546
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
And we're just crazy

547
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,064
I guess

548
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
Who knows

549
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:50,208
Okay let's talk about inference at the edge specifically with regards to smart

550
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Videoke

551
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,536
There is a conference happening right now this

552
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,608
This is ISC West this is an international

553
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,144
Security and control systems

554
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
And you can

555
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
Sensors

556
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
Can see all kinds of

557
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Cool stuff

558
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,032
Big trend

559
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
Apparently is

560
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,128
Video cameras with built-in surveillance

561
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,992
They have chips that are capable of running at the edge so running these models

562
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
To determine who people are

563
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Baby

564
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
Are they people

565
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
Are they doing something weird

566
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,160
Maybe even identifying people

567
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,696
Who are supposed to be there

568
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,000
So this is not brand new

569
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,792
But it is definitely

570
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,376
Going to be it's going to start being much more difficult to buy a video cam

571
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
It doesn't happen

572
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,752
So Western Digital announced their new storage system

573
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,776
4

574
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,056
These cameras

575
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
Set ability to process

576
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
Crap ton of data with

577
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
Best 4K video cameras

578
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,224
And it also allows for storage and in

579
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
The edge

580
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:51,648
Call, announce the new chips so they have the Qualcomm Vision intelligence 400 and 300 platforms they're using

581
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
Latest

582
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,792
Qcs 605 and qcs 603 soces

583
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
That was a lot of

584
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,608
Data and nobody really needs to know

585
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
Anything about them except

586
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
You can basically do

587
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Advanced

588
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,056
All of that for

589
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,080
That has computer

590
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:14,688
Back to mention a ton of partners that are planning to use these chips

591
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
It's like

592
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,992
Well over a dozen

593
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,784
That's kind of surprising

594
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,112
Yeah the bullets it's becoming very much a

595
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,952
It's just an integral part people want cameras they want surveillance cameras and

596
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,976
They want

597
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:31,328
If you add computer vision at the edge or some sort of modeling capability

598
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
You can do two things

599
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,912
S1 you reduce the amount of data that you send that to

600
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680
The cloud cuz you don't

601
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,704
How to send everything

602
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,264
To you can build a system for alerts

603
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,080
Like there are people in this area when there's not supposed to be people

604
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,408
Or these are unrecognized people in this area

605
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
You're being super rich

606
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,712
If you got a super amazing

607
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
Algorithm running

608
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,528
Cuz we've long had

609
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,624
Cameras right the challenge though is you got all this camera data and pee

610
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,904
People have to sort through it and

611
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
And it's time to

612
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Impossible

613
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,768
And uses a lot of bandwidth as you said so if you can

614
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,096
Keep all that locally and have it processed with a

615
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
Model that is already trained

616
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,960
You don't have to send that data to the cloud I would think

617
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,008
That might help some people

618
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,544
Because it's a little scary in

619
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,872
One side you want surveillance the other side you don't want to be surveilled right

620
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,200
You know if you want surveillance if you're home early

621
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,224
Wechat business

622
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,016
And you don't want the

623
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,064
Cloud provider to have the information

624
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,344
What the camera sees

625
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,136
This could resolve that problem

626
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:31,232
Yeah in and having all that locally process data means you can dump it

627
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
And then

628
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,536
It's a little bit more privacy

629
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
It may not be

630
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,888
I believe it's faster to interns the recognition because

631
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Yeah

632
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
Alright so

633
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
I think trans coming out of is

634
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
Next up

635
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,128
What's an update on the mysterious mr. Aldridge

636
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
So we talked about

637
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
Mistral on the last project

638
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
A quick recap is that

639
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
In Google

640
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:59,136
Chromium public codebase which I read for fun

641
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:02,464
I found a bunch of code for a new device called Mistral

642
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:07,840
And tied to that code was Gale and Gale is the current Google Wi-Fi device

643
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
Gail was the codename for that

644
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,704
So I get to speculation and some more digging running

645
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,984
Code and said huh

646
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:18,848
They're using the new Qualcomm QSC 404 and 405 chips

647
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
Which have

648
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,968
On-device voice recognition they have a zigbee chip

649
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,272
I5 cores

650
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
Have a smart speaker

651
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,856
Capabilities

652
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,648
Schedule sitting capabilities I should say

653
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,976
So my speculation was huh this could be

654
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:39,328
The next Google Wi-Fi product as either 2 in 1 or 3 in 1 device

655
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,376
So it'd be your Mesh networking

656
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
Product

657
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,936
Cluster Google

658
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
Assistance

659
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
Such as in a Google home

660
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,544
Plus potentially and actual

661
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
3 radio

662
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
Smart home hub

663
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:56,480
Well I still don't know about the last bit because I haven't seen any mention of the zigbee radio in any code yet

664
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,040
However this week as I was

665
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,368
Spending my fun time reading through code I noticed

666
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,184
That there are now numerous mentions of mesh

667
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,744
Wi-Fi capabilities

668
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
In this device

669
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,888
And for LED lights just like what device that you have right now Stacy

670
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
Google home

671
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
Google home

672
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:22,592
I don't know what to think of happy for you

673
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:27,456
He's probably true you probably do have lots of them but my specific in Frontier is

674
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480
Yeah this is

675
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,528
Definitely at least a two-in-one now

676
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,576
Azure mesh Wi-Fi

677
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,880
Access point and War

678
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
As well as a Google home device

679
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:40,256
So I'm still waiting to see if there's any zigbee code Adam and I will keep

680
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
Looking because I love to Rico

681
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
Yay

682
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
Alright other

683
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
Cool news bits

684
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
Eve

685
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,984
IT company that makes sensors just for Apple's homekit program

686
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,312
They have a new energy strip that is available

687
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
This is like

688
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
Protectors any

689
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,176
Individually control different Outlets

690
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,968
And that is what that is

691
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,040
What is it it's a smart

692
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,344
Power strip that work with tonkatsu

693
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
It has three

694
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
Regular

695
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
Electrical outlets in it

696
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
As well as it looks like

697
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
Possibly

698
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Q yuan

699
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
Babies

700
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,816
How to tell from the pictures

701
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
It does it does have a couple USBS

702
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,912
It is a surge protector as well

703
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,192
Drax actor

704
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,080
Yeah it has direct Wi-Fi connection so it should be very easy to set up so it's not like you're gonna have to

705
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,616
Mess around with an e

706
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,432
Your network settings to too much there

707
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,224
And then obviously you could use

708
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,528
Homekit automations to

709
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,576
Turn things on or off that are plugged into this

710
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
And it'll be a hoe

711
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
9995

712
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
All right

713
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,024
Another newspaper JD Powers

714
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
Where's the company that we

715
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,352
I associated with JD Power Ranking

716
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,680
Kingsbury sing so like how awesome a company is and turn

717
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,240
Consumer sentiment surveys

718
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,568
But they also do benchmarking and they are

719
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,128
They've signed a deal with company called uptake

720
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:00,896
That is based in

721
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
Chicago

722
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
And take

723
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,784
Basically pulls in tons of data and they suggest models to make

724
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
Prediction

725
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
Take whatever action you think

726
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
So

727
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,696
The two companies have gotten together to

728
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:20,096
Create new benchmarks based on the automotive industry in this is really interesting what they're doing is there pool

729
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,376
Pulling in data from

730
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,192
Connected factories from connected cars

731
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,984
And they're trying to

732
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Figure out

733
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,336
What kind of metrics might make sense for

734
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,152
Future vehicles in terms of

735
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
How long it takes for

736
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,992
Service how happy people are with them that sort of

737
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
So

738
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:44,672
It's really fascinating and I'm actually going to try to get JD Powers to come on the show to talk about what they're hoping to get out of this in

739
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:47,232
Workouts because are also going to apply this to the

740
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,768
The Telecommunications industry

741
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,584
And the utilities industry

742
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
So

743
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,448
Discount of a little teaser expect more to come on this because I'm

744
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,544
Really interested in how they're going to pull industry-wide data and make that

745
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
Useful for consume

746
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,224
Yeah I am related to this and it's not

747
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,576
A direct relation but I noticed that on the Amazon developer blog this week

748
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,136
They showed a JD Power survey

749
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
4

750
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,720
Consumer purchasing preferences of

751
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Cars

752
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,840
And its related because 76% of the respondents

753
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
Said they would

754
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,680
Want the same brand of resource they have at home

755
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,960
Triana next vehicle

756
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,776
Sure that makes total sense you don't want multiple

757
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,824
Assistance one for him and one for your car

758
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
But more importantly

759
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
59%

760
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,200
Said they were more likely to buy a certain

761
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,248
Car or from a certain car company

762
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,296
If the voice service is available in the

763
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,624
Car so almost 6 and 10 car buyers

764
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,928
Want voice services in a car

765
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:55,328
According to JD Power survey with Amazon Amazon send me my auto echo my echo Auto

766
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Please

767
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,656

This is a tinker stream this is not for a probably normal people I'm just going to

801
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,176
Right upfront

802
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
But it's really cool

803
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
So

804
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,016

Free to use this on the show

806
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Myquest

807
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,904
Is I have a

808
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Google home

809
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,536
My issue is whenever I have guests over if they like

810
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,072
To turn Z-Wave

811
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,888
I'd like to know how to stop my gas

812
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,656
From

813
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,216
Turning out the temperature for my Google Assistant

814
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
Thank you

815
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
All right

816
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
The first

817
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
I have bad news for

818
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,104
If these are your friends

819
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,992
That's how it's been how to stop this don't invite these people over anymore

820
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,808
Let's let's assume your friends are actually

821
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,112
Pretty decent human beings they just have to

822
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
Spunside

823
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,464
There's really one way to help

824
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,744
But it's going to be

825
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
It's it's a way that

826
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,536
I don't know if

827
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,816
You're going to want to

828
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
So

829
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,656
Google actually lets you do voice matching for this

830
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Car sound system

831
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
B

832
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
All you do is

833
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,544
You can turn this on in your settings in the

834
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,616
Google home and then you will train your Google Assistant

835
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,408
To recognize your voice it's like you

836
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,944
Repeat phrases 3 times

837
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,480
And then it recognizes you

838
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
And then

839
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
Walla

840
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,832
Only when you say some

841
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,904
You're the admin of your house witch

842
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Rate

843
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
Have all the power

844
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
Patella

845
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,840
If anyone else wants to use it back to train their voice

846
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,864
So if you live with

847
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400
More than just you

848
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,960
You're going to want to train their voice if you have children

849
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,520
You have to then implement this insane

850
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
So it takes forever

851
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,592
Where you have to create an account

852
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,616
Kids count

853
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,152
It it's not fun

854
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,432
It will take you time

855
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,480
And that's if they're under 13

856
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
That's if they're under 30

857
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,344
Is there over 13 they just have to have a Google account and

858
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,624
A Google Assistant

859
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,904
And then they Trade It

860
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
If they're going to trade it on your phone

861
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,768
Pro-tip they're not going to check your child age

862
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,864
But you still have to then they have to have a separate device to turn

863
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
Chapter

864
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,704
And then finally

865
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,008
As someone who is actually implemented voice

866
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,312
On voice matching on their Google device

867
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,336
It doesn't always work

868
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:22,432
So sometimes we even when I'm asking Google for something

869
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,456
It's like

870
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
I'm sorry

871
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,504
I can't help you with that

872
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,320
If you would like to train your voice go and do this

873
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:33,952
Google I can't speak to that because I did not turn on voice match because

874
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,256
Say I don't have any friends so nobody comes

875
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,840
And be my everything work my family they would be very upset

876
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,424
Yeah my family it basically my house is Haji turn on television

877
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,216
And then she says

878
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
I have permission to

879
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
And then you hear

880
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
Harem anime

881
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,824
Turn on television

882
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,104
Group the time

883
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,176
That's usually how that operation

884
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,736
That and that explains why you have both

885
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
Pussy system

886
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
There you go

887
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:01,856
And this is an underlying problem that is not being addressed

888
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
In these

889
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
Which is

890
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
Peaceably admin rights for individual

891
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,232
So

892
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,768
Not everybody in your house should be

893
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
Be able to turn the

894
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,560
Heating and

895
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,888
Maybe not everyone in your house should have access to

896
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,424
The water's edge

897
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,008
Maybe not maybe not everyone in your house should have

898
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,544
The ability to

899
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,104
Invite people to open your door locks

900
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,664
That's actually most relaxed do actually have those say

901
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,688
So you can let p

902
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
People in

903
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,224
As an admin

904
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
Where's a gas

905
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:34,880
But it seems like there should be another layer of security in here at some point in the future

906
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,416
To say

907
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,464
Yes I am the admin of the house

908
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,256
And only the admin

909
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,840
Can change the thermostat or only the admin and these people

910
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,168
So the kind that gets one more granular as opposed to

911
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:53,056
Voice match which is an all-or-none situation number one and number two we have other devices that can help

912
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,104
Determine who's actually

913
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,224
In the room for example I presume that this person is gas or doing it when he's not in the room

914
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
You know and

915
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
If you have a camera in the room

916
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,600
Maybe the voices can say it wait

917
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,904
Anybody can turn ya now

918
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,208
You're not here that doesn't make sense

919
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,792
I was going to say what we actually need us both

920
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,632
You need the ability to know you recognize who is asking for something

921
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,424
And then you need a layer of

922
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,240
Basically like active directory for your home

923
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,264
Oh my God

End

928
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Devastated

929
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
The awful

930
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,928
I don't want to spend more time in

931
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,464
Skinny to make it easier

932
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024

Really awesome and is going to talk about

938
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,056
How

939
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:02,432
We need to think about biomarkers for medical devices and how we're authenticating and actually doing some

940
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,968
Some reviewing of

941
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,504
Claims about certain

942
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,040
Digital medicine

943
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
And

944
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,880
She's also going to talk about how the FDA

945
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
Is

946
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Really

947
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:16,256
Becoming a model for other Regulatory Agencies who want to address

948
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,536
Digital transfer

949
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,096
All of this and more

950
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888
After a message

951
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:29,312
Dispenser is software AG hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast

952
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:35,200
I guess for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is software Ag and I have John MacTavish

953
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,760
Who's in the iot group as software AG

954
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,856
This week we're going to talk about how to succeed in the iot

955
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,392
But before we do that

956
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,928
Can you remind us what it is

957
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,208
Software AG does

958
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,232
India

959
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,304
We really provide great Solutions

960
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,888
Simplifying connect

961
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,192
Software applications devices

962
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,984
Richard can be your iot devices

963
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,824
Are people to really quickly abuse business value

964
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,872
Really get that data to work

965
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
So quickly

966
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
Jelly to make really great

967
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,576
Shania TNA

968
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,368
And we also have

969
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,392
Different Analytics

970
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,184
Solution second layer on top

971
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:22,304
We're here to talk about how we can Succeed In The Internet of Things

972
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,352
What are the first things we should think about

973
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
Taking this on

974
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,912
A couple things

975
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,680
1

976
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,240
Drive to project really map to keep it

977
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,312
It's really been driven down by a bee

978
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
Why I say that is

979
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,944
Make it successful you really have to have by in that

980
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,736
Iot can solve a critical Miss

981
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,040
That's really the basic tonight

982
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,064
Project going

983
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,416
Successful iot project understanding ecosystem

984
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,208
Ic3 critical parts

985
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
The hardware Park

986
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
Safari Park

987
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
And the application

988
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
Analytics Spark

989
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
Personally I'd like to talk about

990
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
Hardware

991
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,192
Understand that

992
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
Securing Hardware

993
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
Installing Hardware

994
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,056
It's a critical part and not every company has strength

995
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
In the space

996
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,104
That is one part of the

997
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,176
Ecosystem yet understand either to do that internally or Outsource

998
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,784
The second part Stacey is really getting the date of slowing and that's what team lost

999
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
What's the data

1000
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,368
Percentage outside

1001
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
Shenzhen Hardware

1002
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
Jimmy John's Pekin

1003
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,464
Manage that data

1004
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
To the application layer

1005
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,536
And the third part of the ecosystem

1006
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
Really see application

1007
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,400
Quinoa as a great application

1008
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,240
Quickly I design applications to get data

1009
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
To the business

1010
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
People that need them

1011
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,592
We also have three different Analytics

1012
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
Solutions II

1013
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,200
That has a greater layer of value

1014
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,040
Ways to make a really really great decision

1015
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,832
Change within you

1016
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,672
Okay and what are some of the common pitfalls when trying to implement

1017
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
Some sort of Iota

1018
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
T strategy

1019
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:00,864
Moving too fast too quickly it's one of the things I see these these projects can take a long long time diplomats

1020
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,912
And trying to bite off more than

1021
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,240
What is that really mean

1022
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,544
He's really to try to connect

1023
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,128
Quite different multiple products at once

1024
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,920
Let's just pick one product

1025
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,200
Through the volume

1026
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
Business case

1027
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,504
And then move on

1028
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
Prescribed

1029
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:24,160
In John where can I go to find out more about software Ag and the cumulus

1030
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,464
Please call this operation

Success during the trial

1035
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:48,736
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

1036
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
Andy Corbett

1037
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,344
Who is the CEO and co-founder of Elektra

1038
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,392
Hi Eddie how are you

1039
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,928
Hygrate

1040
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
Thanks for having me

1041
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:01,024
I am super excited because we are going to talk about

1042
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,560
Iot

1043
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,096
In healthcare

1044
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,656
That's my happy noise

1045
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,728
Alright so let's kick it off with telling everybody

1046
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,544
What it is that you were trying to do with Electra

1047
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:18,688
So we are working with connected devices that can remote monitor people in their own homes

1048
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:25,344
Where we really started was over time we realized that people are increasingly more honest with their phones and their with their

1049
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,904
And if you ask anyone

1050
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,672
Including myself

1051
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:34,048
How many times do you work out last week I would probably give you a number that's far higher than what my Fitbit says

1052
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,584
I mean if you think about

1053
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,472
A lot of people like we hate filling out surveys to get any sort of remote data and so a lot of these Technologies

1054
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:46,848
Finally got Joe point where they're collecting clinical-grade data they can do and pass away in your own home

1055
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,920
And they don't look terrible no more and more people wearing connected products

1056
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,480
And so what we're doing with Electra is helping

1057
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:57,856
Mostly today Pharma companies in overtime doctors and payers and providers use resource

1058
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
Connected jewels

1059
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,696
Remotely and have better relationships with their

1060
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
Okay

1061
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:07,840
That is awesome and exciting and really promising and also scary as all get-out

1062
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,376
So we're going to dig into

1063
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
All of

1064
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
But first

1065
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,752
Just the idea of being able to do this

1066
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,288
Is

1067
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,104
Confusing to me in some ways because I feel like

1068
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,456
I have a lot of these connected devices and that might range for my Fitbit 2

1069
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,736
I used to have this

1070
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,272
Crazy like anti-snoring

1071
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
Device Italy

1072
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,368
Attract my story made all sorts of

1073
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,648
Correlations about my health

1074
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
But

1075
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,952
All of these things

1076
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:34,976
They're not

1077
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:39,328
Really FDA-approved necessarily or peer-reviewed so I kind of called them digital snake

1078
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,400
So I'm really curious how you guys are

1079
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
Thinking about

1080
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,704
Making sure

1081
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
These devices are actually

1082
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
Trying to write

1083
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
Conclusions at your house

1084
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,312
Counts from the data

1085
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,104
The Wanted

1086
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
Things that off

1087
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,175
Healthcare is Eid around

1088
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
Digital health

1089
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
What happened with a lot of visual health is

1090
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,527
Really think about what not to do

1091
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,855
So anything that has stopped wearing Healthcare from

1092
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,391
Medical records

1093
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:09,791
And other connected devices to app seem to be in the surrounding digital house which sometimes feels a little bit more oily than having actual

1094
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,119
Find it there's been a movement because

1095
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,655
People don't realize that these

1096
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:19,775
Did Jules have a pretty meaningful way to really change how we deliver care and and you need

1097
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:24,639
To think about how do we actually build a regulatory strategy and instead of trust around

1098
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,663
Quality

1099
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,455
And so there's been a movement towards

1100
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,479
Call digital medicine

1101
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,783
Where did medicine is a subset of

1102
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,343
Is your house that has that level of Clue

1103
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:39,231
And many people split into about three different categories so stop wearing algorithms

1104
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,255
Take a measurement

1105
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,071
Stop that do some sort of diagnosis

1106
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,119
Measure and diagnose

1107
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:51,007
Treat and there's a whole realm of new product called digital Therapeutics that have that sort of treating capability

1108
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,567
Okay that is a lot

1109
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,383
And what is the goal of your company in this white

1110
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,919
Talked about

1111
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,199
Biomarkers in

1112
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Acting is Cisco

1113
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
Pharmacy

1114
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,807
For digital Health Products what is that actually

1115
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,367
Yes we focus on the measure

1116
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:09,183
JD around digital biomarkers

1117
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:13,791
And using software younger than that can measure some sort of Behavioral physiological

1118
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
Should I be something like

1119
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,375
Step count with picture

1120
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,399
Height weight age

1121
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,215
Gyroscope accelerometer and then predict whether or not you make

1122
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:25,823
So all of these artificial by markers are forms of types of algorithm that then

1123
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,871
Can be used to either inform

1124
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
Or drive

1125
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
Different parts of care

1126
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,711
Specifically we work with armor

1127
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
Companies that are

1128
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:37,855
Doing something called decentralized clinical trials which means they're collecting data outside of the clinic

1129
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,927
And are collecting things like vital signs are tremors

1130
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
Or any sort of product that

1131
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,767
Expecting some sort of digital biomarker

1132
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,327
Bedford assessment

1133
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,399
Are you certifying the algorithms or

1134
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,935
We have an atlas

1135
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,727
That has six hundred and

1136
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
40 different types

1137
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Chef products

1138
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,799
And so

1139
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:03,199
General Lee a Pharma company needs to think about which type of product they would want to use a cross for spectrum so wanted

1140
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:07,551
Kaiser on verification and validation verification being if I walk a hundred steps

1141
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,087
Is it measure on your stuff

1142
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:12,415
Invalidation is does 100 step mean something for

1143
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:16,255
I could just see you or for my Parkinson's or what my clinical population is

1144
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:21,631
Second is around usability what's the battery life not worth it in the shower

1145
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
It look like a prison bracelet

1146
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,679
I wear it

1147
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:28,799
Third is around the security principles for this don't like how do I actually manage the risk

1148
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:35,199
If I'm instrumenting someone with multiple sensors like how do I think about the attack servicenow the person that something from hasn't released

1149
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
Before

1150
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
And enforce

1151
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
Is around

1152
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,063
BK Racing Engine

1153
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:46,719
Accurate even if it's relatively usable even if it's relatively secure doesn't solve the Cambridge

1154
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,743
Issue

1155
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,511
Where

1156
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,303
Data were shared and not

1157
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,863
But we're here in a way that people did not enter

1158
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:57,471
And what we do is we have instead of objective measures across

1159
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
Insidious

1160
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,031
Four Concepts and then

1161
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:00,799
We

1162
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,591
Score that effectively like Nutrish

1163
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,943
Where you might say okay really need to make sure this has a peer-reviewed paper or it's been used

1164
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,503
In an FDA level study and

1165
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,551
Can cover how you think about accuracy

1166
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,111
I don't really care if you can be used in the shower now that's not so

1167
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,391
Important to us

1168
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,671
And then you can make trade-offs

1169
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
To decide which

1170
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,487
Type of choice quotes

1171
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Forgiven

1172
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
Environment

1173
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:25,119
I had never thought about that side effects may include dry mouth and hacking

1174
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
Oh my gosh

1175
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:32,287
Okay yeah so this would be something like my Fitbit or my Apple watch and I would just

1176
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:36,639
I bring that in and it would be that for a specific type of use case cuz

1177
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,455
My Fitbit might be awesome for steps the Apple watch might be

1178
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,783
Great for measuring certain types of heart issues is at the way to think about it

1179
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:46,623
Yeah and what's really been interesting as I think people historically is that okay we have

1180
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,415
Consumer devices and then we have

1181
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,975
Clinical devices in these things are totally different.

1182
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,815
Starting to happen is that they're merging so many of the clinical device

1183
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:58,399
Companies have been partnering with tech companies that have created more Nimble and

1184
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
Products

1185
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,239
Depending on what they need you might go for either

1186
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:08,639
And so for many of the more traditionally consumer products they've been working with the FDA to the FDA has a new program called.

1187
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,687
Pre-certification program and a number of

1188
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,759
Big tech companies have been involved in it so damn son

1189
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,039
Fairly which is an ox

1190
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,063
Google

1191
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
Apple

1192
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:23,231
Fitbit and number of others are all working with the FDA to create higher evidence-based products that they can then submit and have part of

1193
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,279
Regulatory and Healthcare.

1194
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,839
Okay and we will get to the FDA soon

1195
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,375
But before we do

1196
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,703
Let's talk about the big elephant in the room which is

1197
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,727
Privacy

1198
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,007
Actually guess it's not the other

1199
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,287
Because you're totally named it but

1200
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
Not this earlier

1201
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
So

1202
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,383
You mentioned that right now

1203
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,199
This is mostly for pharmaceutical companies that

1204
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,479
They're using this

1205
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:48,575
And it is for their clinical trials so let's talk first about

1206
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,879
What is this mean and how would you use this in a clinic

1207
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,647
Michael trial

1208
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,951
And then we'll talk about what this means is it

1209
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,487
Expands to a broader pop

1210
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,255
Population in town

1211
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,535
How we're going to think about

1212
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,631
Listening coyote in clinical trials what does it look like today

1213
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:08,799
Yes I think privacy kind of has two ways that I generally think about it so privacy being more like 1

1214
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:14,175
Affected the security part where maybe somebody's attacking assistant and then there's also privacy where you

1215
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,783
You don't necessarily have an attack but you're the way that the date eraser structure and somebody can do

1216
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,831
Alexey moron

1217
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111
Security

1218
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:22,879
Contact

1219
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,415
Start has never really had to

1220
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,231
To think about anything like that before the date of the fifth collected

1221
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,511
Clinical trials

1222
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:33,631
Blood drives or other things that are relatively standard and they have most of their data

1223
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,399
Stored in

1224
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,191
Ways that they have to four

1225
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
Science

1226
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,751
And I never really had to use the

1227
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,311
Things that are internet connected on multiple

1228
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,359
Time today that are remote from

1229
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:47,455
And so this kind of creates an entirely new type of infrastructure that they

1230
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,735
I think I'll have to think about it

1231
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,575
Are they looking at using this data for

1232
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:58,975
In a clinical trial setting I assume that this data is isolated for that setting or they trying to create massive

1233
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
Stores of

1234
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,327
Potential patient data what are the rules in place that they

1235
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,863
Thinking up when trying to use

1236
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,703
I think many of this is up for play

1237
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:15,103
The most Pharma companies when they think about running a clinical trial their data has always been their data so they run is steady and

1238
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,639
The Last of Us

1239
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,175
Father of the study

1240
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
What's different about a lot of connects

1241
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,759
It's all these they don't necessarily have back

1242
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,575
Can fit them better just going to store clinical trial date anyone

1243
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,879
They pull out of it together

1244
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:33,279
And in fact many is a wearable companies use that data to retrain their models over time and they don't have a way of splitting it out

1245
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,863
This is pretty new for them to think about it okay if you're going to collect

1246
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,631
Data auto

1247
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,679
Relatively vulnerable patient population

1248
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,959
How do I

1249
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:44,543
Ensure that these data maintain private or that

1250
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,823
We know

1251
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,591
How something

1252
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,175
Has been consented overtime and we can manage it away that's responsible for our

1253
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,991
Okay and let's go big picture in it

1254
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,527
That's because you you mentioned

1255
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,599
Earlier that the concept of personalized medicine is

1256
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,879
Basically surveillance

1257
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,903
Because

1258
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,487
To deliver this care you're going to have to understand someone

1259
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,047
Inside and out in a way that's really kind of

1260
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,071
Is it raining

1261
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,607
That's a big responsibility

1262
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,631
How should we

1263
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,727
Think about that world is that something we should really welcome or the benefits outweighing the

1264
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,495
The cost

1265
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:20,127
I think the constant question is just making sure the benefits outweigh the cost in some instances they will and some they won't

1266
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:26,527
Bermuda thing that starts get more important is really thinking about some of the Norms that we have the questions that people with

1267
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,575
Identify

1268
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:32,671
And at some point you collect so much data that the identification become

1269
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,487
Analogies thinking about

1270
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,023
How would you be identified by

1271
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,863
You can't write like my genome is unique

1272
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,167
Me and if it were truly G identify

1273
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,447
Then it went really do

1274
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:49,567
Might be able to strip out parts of personally identifiable information

1275
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,383
U-Store-It but if I ever had a snip it you'd be able to

1276
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,783
Parrot back 30 seconds of walked in and I'm a uniquely identifiable person

1277
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:03,135
Thinking about things like so who owns the day that there's not really data ownership is

1278
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:06,207
It's really much more about data governance and who gets access to it

1279
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,023
And really thinking about okay if we're going to be in a system where things

1280
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,559
Can TD identified

1281
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:14,399
How do we make sure that only the right people have access to it and they're using it in a way that's

1282
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,703
And how far away are we from

1283
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:21,311
It really all depends on how the registry is or how the data are stored

1284
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,335
Armentine

1285
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:26,175
And then the thing that I really like about working with Pharma is that

1286
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,711
They think a lot about him

1287
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
Subjects research

1288
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,271
That's the whole work that they do

1289
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,575
And so there's a lot of norms

1290
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,855
And thoughts around informed

1291
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,903
And making sure that that consent is

1292
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
Truly

1293
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,487
Informed if you think about post-market and

1294
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,303
Text companies we're constantly and human subjects test

1295
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,191
I'm sure Facebook running a number of experiments with me about what they're showing me on the news feed and how I respond but that's

1296
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,727
Pretty much unconsented

1297
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,007
Human subjects research

1298
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,031
Ento

1299
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,591
The thing that I'm more nervous about is not necessarily would have

1300
00:50:54,847 --> 00:51:00,479
Structures but as it starts to move out and Warren Moore this check is used in a non-regulated

1301
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:04,831
How do you make sure that somebody actually consented and know each other information is being used over.

1302
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,415
Alright which seems like a good segue into

1303
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,439
The FDA

1304
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,231
You were recently in

1305
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,511
Entrepreneur-in-residence

1306
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,791
At the FDA

1307
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,559
And

1308
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,095
What were you doing with him

1309
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:22,239
Isn't that the FDA would call the special government employee I've never acted as I no longer

1310
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,263
Pepsi employee

1311
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,055
What I was doing with the time is

1312
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,895
Becky has been very forward thinking about how to handle some of these

1313
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:34,015
I think there's so much opportunity and they recognized that holding things back is

1314
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,319
In many ways a different way of

1315
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:39,903
Stopping someone from getting care so we definitely don't want to have things that

1316
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:45,535
Hurt or harm people but also having a solution that you don't allow people to get access to causing the different type of harm

1317
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:49,375
She has realized we need to rethink how we manage diaper products

1318
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,655
So today

1319
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,935
You're not making constant

1320
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,495
Changes to drugs over time but we are making

1321
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,287
Changes to Software

1322
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:59,103
If you had your imagined that Facebook could only

1323
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:04,479
Check one software update a year that would be crazy and we don't expect Facebook to maintain order

1324
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,759
Stay in somebody's life

1325
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,063
We need to rethink as a

1326
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,111
Society and at the regulatory

1327
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,135
Institution

1328
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:16,767
How do we add a whole group of people working in software wants to maintain a certain regulatory update

1329
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,583
Okay and that is key so like

1330
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,631
How do we adapt the

1331
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,911
Approval process

1332
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,727
For medical devices is one aspect

1333
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,263
That I know the fda's

1334
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:32,383
Another is actually a big topic that we've had people in the show talk about which is

1335
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,919
How do you create

1336
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,199
A security framework

1337
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,991
That these devices can be both

1338
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:41,087
Tested and make sure that they're not vulnerable to hacks and then also

1339
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,367
Updated on a regular

1340
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,671
Killer bases this can be

1341
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,695
Heart attack

1342
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,743
Regulatory approval process

1343
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,511
That we just talked about

1344
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,047
But it could also be

1345
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:53,887
Possibly making sure that things actually get updated

1346
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,959
Which doesn't always happen especially in

1347
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,055
I like the first one because

1348
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,591
One of the pilot program today

1349
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,895
It's quite interesting and then the second

1350
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,455
What are the pilot programs yes she is working on

1351
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,735
Play something called preacher

1352
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:12,575
Any idea behind precert is that you would precertify

1353
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,623
Company under a series at excellence

1354
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
Principles

1355
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:19,231
Include cyber security responsibilities quality safety

1356
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:25,887
And companies that have this level of Excellence Banner able to ship updates in a way that they can do that a lot faster

1357
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,935
There and have a different type of faster review

1358
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,471
Amazing

1359
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:33,311
I'm totally different from how the FDA has ever regulated a product before

1360
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:36,127
We don't say hey Pfizer you make good drugs like kind of

1361
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:42,015
Ship is made under this paradigm

1362
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,039
Something that is currently being

1363
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
Bears

1364
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,647
A lot of different ways that the FDA

1365
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,415
Thinking about this

1366
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:52,255
They've released a free market and post Market Guidance the last year

1367
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,279
2 years

1368
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:57,119
One of the big topics that has come out of that is thinking about something called

1369
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,423
Cyber security or software billing

1370
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:04,543
Materials and the idea behind materials is thinking about a piece of software

1371
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,079
Like a nutrition label

1372
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:11,455
So today nobody Bill Cipher from scratch we all put in through three components into that

1373
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:17,087
And if you have a third-party component that has a vulnerability how do you make sure that one you know that that component

1374
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:19,391
Event your piece of software and that you've been able

1375
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,415
Do the update

1376
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,951
Any idea around having a list

1377
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,719
Ingredients

1378
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,535
First Security building materials then you would be able to

1379
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,095
To maintain and manage that process overtime

1380
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:35,007
And what else is the FDA working on those the two big issues that the FDA cares about when it comes to

1381
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,031
Connected medical devices

1382
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:42,687
They definitely check out that your guidance is that they has one of things I think it's been really interesting about the way the FDA taking this approach

1383
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:49,087
Which is making sure that they're not just building something in house and then releasing it out but how do they do the best type of collaboration

1384
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,135
Security conference has been

1385
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,415
Surprisingly

1386
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:58,815
Perhaps your many people place where the FDA has found out a lot of new information and has really been expanding its

1387
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,351
Thinking around how to deal with

1388
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,399
Security vulnerabilities and working

1389
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,423
Security researchers

1390
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,007
That 3 years ago the FDA went to Defcon for the first time

1391
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,799
Which is amazing

1392
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,639
Inogen.com is not a place that says generally go publicly

1393
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,943
I think many TANF

1394
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,247
Kind of go undercover but they don't show up as a Fed

1395
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,039
There's a game called find the Fed

1396
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,063
You do not want to be found

1397
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,343
The biohacking Village

1398
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,647
Which is one of the villages under

1399
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,415
Domayne desk

1400
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,207
Kind which looks at a lot of

1401
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:29,023
Tracking devices in different stores biohacking

1402
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,327
Products and has been

1403
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,863
Working collaboratively with them

1404
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,399
The one thing that has been

1405
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,423
Kind of meat is

1406
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:41,823
In January the FDA had a very large public Workshop around cybersecurity and they launched a new initiative called

1407
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,103
#sweetheart hacker

1408
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,151
And if you go to sweetheart hacker

1409
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:45,919
Dr. Org

1410
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
This is

1411
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:51,551
An initiative where the FDA has been working to build more collaboration around

1412
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,599
Medical device communities and

1413
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,879
The security research community

1414
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,927
So Abbott thermofisher

1415
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
Celebs

1416
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,231
BB&T

1417
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:02,047
Companies that all committed to attend Defcon this year

1418
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:04,095
And I work collaboratively with

1419
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,631
Researchers and regulator

1420
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:11,775
And this is actually been a model that I personally think should be applied to other Industries

1421
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,311
For example

1422
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:16,639
We actually talked about this Kevin and I are earlier on another show

1423
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,967
With regards to the Boeing 737 Max

1424
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:20,991
And

1425
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,271
The sensor malfunction

1426
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,343
And idea here is if the FAA actually

1427
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,903
Had a process that mirrored some of the things that

1428
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,439
The FDA is doing

1429
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,743
We may not have had that issue and

1430
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,839
Also just going forward as we're talking about like autonomous cars and

1431
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,887
Giving computers more control

1432
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,167
For more things

1433
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,703
This sort of framework

1434
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,727
Makes a lot of sense

1435
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,031
I know I think that's important

1436
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:50,431
The thing that has been really interesting and amazing for me is before the FDA got involved it to communities

1437
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,223
Had trouble working together

1438
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,503
So that

1439
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,039
Security research community

1440
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:59,903
Started researching a couple different devices one of the first ones that they were looking at with pacemakers

1441
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:03,999
Pacemakers generally try to maintain as long as battery life that they can

1442
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,303
And not do anything that's computationally expensive

1443
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,655
Turn that encryption of many types are found is computational expensive

1444
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,679
I'm so

1445
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,703
A lot of them work

1446
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:17,823
So they're relatively trivial exploits that you could do that could reverse-engineer protocol

1447
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,615
Drain the battery and or

1448
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,639
Initiate a shock

1449
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:25,759
So for many of the researchers and I found this they said hey we should disclose and

1450
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,295
Help them do an update

1451
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,343
I mean they were doing the disclosures

1452
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,183
I'm like any normal tech company when you didn't disclosure there's something

1453
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:38,559
Like a responsible and coordinated disclosure that you can then have the update maybe have a bug Bounty and every

1454
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,119
It's fine with the connected devices

1455
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,191
The device companies okay thanks for doing this we're going to see you

1456
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,751
And that researchers like wait what

1457
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:49,311
Are you doing this medical you tampered with our device

1458
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,639
You can't we just can't ship updates whenever we want we regulated

1459
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,223
And so the FBI stepped in and said hey

1460
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:59,551
We are not going to be the problem here also that is a fallacy

1461
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,599
You do have a security incident you can

1462
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:05,695
Until we want to make sure that this sort of feedback mechanism is

1463
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,463
Getting better

1464
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,791
Is it has been a really big part of some of this

1465
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:14,655
We're too it's helping some of these bigger companies for learning how to do things like coordinated

1466
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
Disclosure

1467
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,959
Can do it in a way that they can

1468
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,751
What's it more of these sorts of updates

1469
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,823
And that is a really important thing to say

1470
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,615
So everybody out there listening

1471
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:28,735
If you have a medical device and you need to update it for security reasons the FDA is totally okay with

1472
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,015
Okay

1473
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:30,783
What Andy

1474
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,319
I have learned a lot

1475
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:38,975
I am cautiously optimistic about the future of personalized medicine I love that you're helping address the digital snake

1476
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,255
Coil problem and

1477
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:44,351
I appreciate what you've done actually with the FDA as a person who

1478
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,119
Uses battle

1479
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,679
So the one thing I try to balance

1480
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:53,567
A train is like not being to fudge like it does scare the crap out of me for a lot of this stuff

1481
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,103
And also

1482
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:55,871
How to use

1483
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,663
They sold responsibly and safely

1484
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:00,735
I think it has a lot of textures the whole movie fast

1485
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:07,135
And break things and that means people die right in healthcare but the nice thing about Healthcare being a bit slower is we might

1486
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:10,975
A chance to design systems that better serve people

1487
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,071
And I think this is a really powerful time boats for Regulators for

1488
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:21,471
Companies that are trying to develop trustworthy systems or more people are competing on trust so how can we make

1489
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
Make sure

1490
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
That way partner

1491
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:27,359
Responsible and really hopeful. Some of the biggest issues that we have

1492
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,663
So thanks for coming on the show

1493
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:36,319
Thank you for having me that's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if you
