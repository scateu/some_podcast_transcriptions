So much

22
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,968
But first before we kick it off

23
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
IMessage

Dot-com

44
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,008
Okay Kevin

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
I love doing the show

46
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
Except it's kind of hard on it

47
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:57,248
There's a lots of great questions that we get him since we only do one voicemail question.

48
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,784
During the regular weekly show

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,368
This lets us catch up in a sense and get back to everybody else who might have caught

50
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,696
I should mention that throughout this year

51
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,280
We have to voicemail sponsors but the show one is Schlage

52
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
Which makes

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
Smart locks a variety of high-quality smart locks fit

54
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
Everyone knows and loves

55
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,728
And a pharaoh which is an iot development platform

56
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,592
And you hear about them almost every other episode on the show so

57
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,152
You probably know about them but we do want to give a big shout-out

58
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
Since this is

59
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
All brought to you

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
Buy them

61
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
All right

62
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
Yay slang

63
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,856
Yay

64
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,672
Alright let's kick it off with a message

65
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
Jeremy

66
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,000
I believe it

67
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Let's hear it

68
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,584
Hi this is Jerry from Little Rock

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,912
I'm looking for something for the educational Market

70
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,448
That would help induce

71
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
Students to AI

72
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,800
We've tinkered with chatbots and like

73
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
To incorporate this

74
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
Into working with

75
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,408
Skills from anime or Google home

76
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Are you serious

77
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
These devices have

78
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,296
So the question is

79
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
Is this the best around

80
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,904
To go and if so do you have ideas on how to get this

81
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,952
Happier in educational Market

82
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
Perhaps the bigger question

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
Do you have an opinion of a better route to go to inter

84
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
AI

85
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
Thanks in advance love you show

86
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
Oh

87
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,960
Jeremy I like you so much for being a caring smart

88
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,752
Exciting teacher I wish I were in your class

89
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:29,920
Yes and it's ironic that Jeremy is asking this question because in my comp sci class at my local community

90
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
College

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,248
We ran into the same issue

92
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,552
Esl older students probably

93
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,184
We couldn't get access to the student emails

94
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,000
Through the Google cloud and other things we wanted to use

95
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
So I had to use my own personal

96
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,840
Account for all of our API calls in one

97
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
So I totally get it

98
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,912
And even more so because

99
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,752
This is really tricky if the students were the kids are under 13

100
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,824
Because in most cases then they can't have an account

101
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
Well they can have one but it

102
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
Tied to their

103
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:07,040
Yeah it's it's just Anna and I don't even know if that kind of account I am not going to call it a sub account

104
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,600
But Google has school-related

105
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Accounts

106
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,416
I haven't seen

107
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
Assistant

108
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,744
In-home devices attached to

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Nearby

110
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
Right and they would need

111
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,143
An account that kind of works with assistant if they want to Tinker with the apis that Google provides

112
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,191
This kind of stuff on Google not the only one

113
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,519
Amazon and Microsoft and many many other

114
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,311
Companies have apis Atwood

115
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
Be useful for what Jeremy's looking for

116
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
So

117
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,687
I hate to say it. I have a couple options

118
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,247
This one is to do what I asked you what I just did

119
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,319
I register my account for different API services

120
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,391
Somewhere for Google summer for lifx

121
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Etc

122
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
To get an API

123
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
Key

124
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,791
And once you have the API key if you can do any kind of like coding

125
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,887
You can just let the students and the kids use that API key to

126
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
Access

127
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
Any

128
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Cloud type

129
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,751
Air ml services

130
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
So that's one option

131
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
There are a couple of

132
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,151
Things out there some products one is relatively new because it

133
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,991
Kickstarter right now in fact it's Mike Elgan

134
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Sun

135
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,367
Mike Elgan we don't know he does the used to do that

136
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,439
This week in Google show you talk to me for Stacy right now am I

137
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
Oh yeah I know

138
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
Mike is a smart fella

139
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,839
And his son is a very smart fellow too because he has a Kickstarter right now

140
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143
That already met its goals already funded

141
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
It's called The Chatterbox

142
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,495
And it's a DIY smart speaker that

143
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
He says anyone can program

144
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,079
And the reason this is really

145
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
Geared towards kids

146
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
Is that

147
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
It all

148
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,455
Happens everything happens on the device

149
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
She don't even need any accounts

150
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:46,623
There might be some parents out there who are like I don't want my kids voice in the cloud I don't know

151
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:52,255
It's a it's a thing but it's a this is a little smart speaker sad Power by Raspberry Pi

152
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
As I got

153
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
Cute little cardboard

154
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,399
Teasing that the kids create what makes it look like a standing up

155
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,959
Robot foxy but still kind of cute

156
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
Additionally

157
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
You can

158
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Program it

159
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,591
It looks like it's blocked lie to me

160
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,383
Which is like a dragon drop kind of

161
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Programming language

162
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,247
So it's not like too complex for the kids to play with the boys services on the

163
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
So that's an option

164
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,319
What age range

165
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
For those kind of kids for that

166
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,927
Honestly I mean you can

167
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
Probably go

168
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
Could I would say down to age

169
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:29,631
It's a six or seven with supervision okay and how much is it

170
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,727
So this started out at $99 and all the backers

171
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,311
Eat that up and then went to 109 and ate that up to

172
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,895
So I don't see how you can order it just yet

173
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
Because

174
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
The kickstarter is over

175
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
So what I would say is Go to the

176
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
Kickstarter website

177
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,623
Follow along what's going on because they make us for sale

178
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
I'm sure they'll tell you where you can get at that point

179
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
Got it okay

180
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
And you said you had one other option

181
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,631
I do Google actually make something very similar called their Vision kit

182
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
That's the aiy projects

183
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,775
Start with google.com site where you can buy The Voice kid or

184
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
Nhtp you if you want but

185
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
Specifically the vision kit

186
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,175
I looked through there if you want to get into AI with

187
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Computer vision

188
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,271
I don't see any requirement on that

189
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,831
That says you need a Google account

190
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,135
I do see it for The Voice Kids

191
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,231
So I believe it's like pre-configured to like use a test

192
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Account

193
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,303
To access the Vision Services service

194
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,095
In which case

195
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
You don't need

196
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
To worry about

197
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Tranchulas and such

198
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,495
Okay so you could just get this and

199
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,847
Unauthorised computer vision

200
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,895
Not traceable trackable etcetera

201
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
There we go

202
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,039
Okay so Jeremy hopefully some of that helps you

203
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Hopefully

204
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
You have the budget to do some of this with your kids at

205
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,415
Sounds like a lot of fun

206
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Okay

207
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,255
Next up we have a question from Keith

208
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
Who is just checking up on me

209
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
Thanks Keith

210
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Let's hear it

211
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
Play Susan Kevin

212
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
Is Keith from going to Arizona

213
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
Pico question CCU

214
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,287
Let's begin the year you mentioned that you're going to move everything over to Google

215
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
Home versus

216
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
Using Alexa products

217
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Anime

218
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
So kind of curious

219
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
That is going

220
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
And

221
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
Do you want to go back

222
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
And

223
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,855
I'd like to get your experience but that what you like and dislike

224
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,647
And if you do go back

225
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Why you going

226
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
Keith

227
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
This is really

228
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
A sad sad

229
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
Story

230
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
I switched everything to Google

231
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
You're correct

232
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,495
I loved it and actually my family loves the Google smart display that we have we have two 10-inch Lenovo smart display

233
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
And then I threw

234
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,591
Add a Google home in a couple minutes running

235
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
I can tell you that

236
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,199
Everything was unplugged Within

237
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
Probably two weeks

238
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,551
And the reason was I had

239
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
Done the voice match

240
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,647
And with voice match

241
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
Which wasn't

242
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
2 strong

243
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,631
Couldn't recognize my voice probably half of

244
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:15,263
It did great with my husband's voice but at first he was kind of hacked off because he had to go train it

245
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
And so is this

246
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
And then

247
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,687
It didn't recognize my daughter at all

248
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:28,319
And get her voice match on there because she wasn't using a phone with a Google account on it

249
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,903
Because she was under 13 and technically can't have one

250
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
Was a whole thing

251
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
That we just did not do

252
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
So

253
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,583
It was awesome in theory that I could be like

254
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,447
Hey what's on my calendar my husband gets a call Mom and it would call his mom is opposed to my mom

255
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
But

256
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
We had to turn that off

257
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
But before we turned it off

258
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,615
Basically everyone in my house whenever back to madam

259
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,151
Because they were kind of trained to use

260
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
And we kept

261
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,759
The main Google home hub plugged in

262
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,319
And once we turned off The Voice

263
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
Recognition

264
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Capability

265
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,159
People used it sometimes

266
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
But again

267
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,719
4 most basic

268
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
Commands

269
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
It didn't work as well

270
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
Also

271
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
When we die

272
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Sports turn on the television

273
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:17,983
Sometimes it would be able to do it sometimes it wouldn't and then if it didn't we that say okay ask Harmony Wichita

274
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
Because we're using Logitech Harmony

275
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
Turn on the television

276
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
Then it would do it but

277
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
It was a little hit or miss

278
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
My daughter didn't like using it

279
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Because

280
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,295
Google still doesn't play the same thing she wants to play with Spotify

281
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:37,695
Their Spotify integration is still a little wonky so sometimes it still plays the karaoke versions of popular songs

282
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
Instead of the actual song

283
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
Where is

284
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,815
Madam is like oh

285
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
You want to hear Blank Space by Taylor Swift

286
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
I got that she plays that right

287
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,007
Google sometimes would play an instrumental version

288
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
And you be like

289
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
Why Google

290
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,103
Is that really what people want to hear

291
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
That's kind of held out when

292
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
We still have

293
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:04,319
The display and we love it because it's showing photos and that's super vine Everyone likes that

294
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
And we use it to

295
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
Settled

296
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12,255
I called my room argument there really is no supper table arguments where we're sitting down at dinner in

297
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,559
We're having. Like why is it this way

298
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
So we do tend to ask Google more questions

299
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,751
I mean I had the matinee and plug for maybe a week before my Family Feud need

300
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Whatever like

301
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
No

302
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
This is terrible

303
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
So when you end up

304
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,919
And your final destination in Seattle

305
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
I assume you're going to

306
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
Put madhumeh back in everywhere

307
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,575
Yeah it's matinee all the way although

308
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,159
This is it now this will be a challenge because of the whole nest

309
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
Deprecation kind of issue

310
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,535
We do like the smart doorbell of choice for me is the nest

311
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
So

312
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
Its entirety have the Google display should I

313
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,007
You know use that display to show us who's at the door like when we're in the kitchen

314
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
It already shows us

315
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
Video from

316
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,663
I mean since we have it we're probably going to just use the net

317
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Bright that makes sense

318
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
It's interesting my experience

319
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
Not that I moved or anything and

320
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,367
And not that Keith cares about my house

321
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,439
At my experience is very different and we're all Google

322
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
And

323
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,815
The difference by The Voice match

324
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:25,215
We don't use the voice match because if I want personal information I just use my phone for that and everybody else uses their phone for

325
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
They're not

326
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
Big into sitting around the

327
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,591
Kitchen table and then asking the smartest by what's next on our calendar

328
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Cuz

329
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895
They just use their phones

330
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
Just a difference in how they use it that's fine

331
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
So no voice match

332
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,807
And they don't really use either

333
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
Of the smart speaker

334
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,879
Platforms that much at all by

335
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Comparison to me

336
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
So

337
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
They Don't Really Care as much

338
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:51,327
This is how much we use it in my house no lyric that's where you're actually

339
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Like we're packed

340
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
By the time you guys

341
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
Hear this I'll have been in Co

342
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,775
But we're like the idea of living for 2 weeks out of a suitcase

343
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,591
We still had to keep one Amazon Echo.

344
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Device

345
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:08,735
You guys use it for music as this do I nobody else in my house listen to music with me but you guys

346
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,831
You used the services that come with these devices far more than my family.

347
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
Music timers

348
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
Yeah like my husband

349
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
It is like

350
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
We have the echo in my daughter's room

351
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,583
So she can you set his alarm clock but every night before he goes to bed my husband's like

352
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Anime

353
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
Set up

354
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
Yeah

355
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,775
I mean I'll use a voice assistant to preheat the June oven for example

356
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
That's awesome cuz you're like hands are all sticky

357
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
But my wife will

358
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,503
Walk out of the room go across the house

359
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Hit the button

360
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
Walk away back into town

361
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
I'm like why you doing that

362
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
She's way healthy

363
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
I'm actually using it to Adam

364
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,535
Data to my Fitbit now I know how much water I drink

365
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
So I'm like

366
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Smart

367
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
So Keith

368
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
That is how I'm going

369
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,983
It's pretty much variable depends on your situation

370
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
You know what I'm all in on Google so I really wish it would

371
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
Work better for us

372
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
Okay

373
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
Let's see we have got

374
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
A question from no-name

375
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
An unnamed individual coming up

376
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
But

377
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,879
This is a question we've gotten a couple times

378
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,927
Kevin's actually tried to do this

379
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
Couple different ways

380
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
So

381
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,791
This is all about making your washing machine smart

382
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Let's listening

383
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
Quick question is regarding

384
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,031
You let my not smart washer and dryer machines

385
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:41,407
Unfortunately have plugs that do not work with normal

386
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
Outlets monitoring

387
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,039
So I haven't been able to just use energy

388
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
Laundry is finished

389
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
I was wondering if you guys had any others

390
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Thank you

391
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:57,535
Yeah so we're right since we've gotten this we probably get this question like at least

392
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
Every two months

393
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,655
There's a lot of folks that want to know how to do this with the easiest way to do it

394
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:07,007
The thing is there's no truly easy way to do it the way I think

395
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,823
People would like it to work we have to kind of

396
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
There is one easy way

397
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
Easiest way to do this

398
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
Is Dubai

399
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
Connected washer

400
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,551
But if you don't want to buy a whole new washer dryer

401
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
And I don't blame you

402
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Now

403
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
Yeah okay

404
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,951
So there's there's your thousand-dollar option

405
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
Crazy I'll do it

406
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,423
I found a bunch of folks that have had success

407
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,775
With a SmartThings multi-sensor which measures vibration

408
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
I think it measures

409
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
Noise

410
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,919
Vibration temperature

411
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Open close

412
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
Humidity

413
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,159
Yeah but space in their focus on the vibration

414
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,511
Because they attach this to their washer dryer and

415
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,071
Paisley set up a rule that says

416
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
Set an alarm if

417
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,959
It's not vibrating for X number of seconds or minutes

418
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,031
You need to set that there an actual there's like a skill for that

419
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
Cassette that you need to make sure because I was listening cycle through

420
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,455
The devices may stop vibrating for maybe 30 seconds 45 seconds Munoz

421
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,015
Maybe cuz it's refilling water in the washer Etc

422
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:26,367
You need to understand and adjust that for you in particular washer dryer but

423
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,927
That's what folks have been very happy with

424
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
Considering there just isn't

425
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
A great off-the-shelf option other than

426
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
As we said buying a home

427
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Set of appliances

428
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,887
You could also make your own

429
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,703
I wouldn't say it's easier but it's an option for people that get tinker

430
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:47,103
We can put a link in the show notes to a Raspberry Pi Appliance Monitor and does the same thing with a vibration sense

431
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
So

432
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,943
If you don't feel like mine when you can make your own

433
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,759
In that scenario though I have to buy the pie

434
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,343
Play the program it for like do I have to download some sort of

435
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,951
Absolutely I recognition Okay and then I need to have a wireless component I need to get a

436
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
Shield or a hat

437
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,375
Whatever Wi-Fi and the pies are almost

438
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:15,007
All them, so you don't have to add any special radio frequencies or anything like that

439
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,383
But as far as downloading code know your absolute right and the link we have that car to a GitHub project

440
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,943
So the code is already there as well as the instructions so it's not

441
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,039
Terribly miss you a first time user could you just download the code

442
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
That is up on GitHub

443
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,111
To the Pines pretty much run at

444
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,415
But other options that

445
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
Some people do and I don't recommend

446
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
You can actually

447
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,071
Make a 220-volt outlet smart

448
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
But every time I've seen that it's

449
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
You have to hardwire your

450
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
Appliance to this

451
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Outlet

452
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
This plug

453
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,591
And that's not something I would at that point you might as well just go buy a new washer

454
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,383
Yeah you don't want to play with 200

455
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:57,247
Not so much

456
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
It's not a cool thing

457
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Have happened in your

458
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,111
Okay so those are really good options

459
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,415
Let's pause for a moment and

460
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
Take a break

461
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
Wear weave this week sponsor

462
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,023
This week sponsor is

463
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
Dell Technologies

464
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,399
We're taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast

465
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,799
Spur message from our sponsor sponsor is Dell Technologies and I'm here with Chris Lynn

466
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,127
Hi Chris thanks for joining our podcast today

467
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,687
Can you tell us a little bit about yourself

468
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
Hi Stacy thanks for having

469
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,695
Digital film industry

470
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,815
So with your oil and gas background in data architecture and digital oilfield Solutions

471
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
Weird how have you seen oil and gas

472
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,447
Gas is very possible

473
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
Automation oriented

474
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,031
Dismiss

475
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,615
Four major areas of growth for it number one

476
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Stranded

477
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
Number two is

478
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
Capturing

479
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,991
Data increase velocity

480
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:06,111
Number three is actually providing more analytics and applications at the edge

481
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,415
What area that is really exploding

482
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:14,047
Is using non typical data types like video audio and graphic Imaging to do

483
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,095
Real-time operations analyst

484
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,263
Excellent so what are some of the key areas for companies to think about if they want to deliver successful iot

485
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
Project specifically in oil

486
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Number one

487
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
We have to remember its first

488
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
And foremost about this

489
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
How do you help the business

490
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:36,063
Be successful to increasing production

491
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,927
Specifically willful operation

492
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
Automation

493
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,863
Understand

494
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:55,263
Balsam it devices to make it better

495
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,615
Use with it and number three how to make

496
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,919
Consumers on that day that day scientist

497
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,991
What are you sedated and course-related back to business

498
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,527
Howling and users

499
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,599
And uses to integration and work less

500
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,231
And then we move differently there's three other key components

501
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
What's my connectivity

502
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,079
Put these things all together you

503
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
Understand how they work

504
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:37,247
Together and you can make a really good business case and you can deliver a really successful project

505
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,087
So I understand data-driven production is coming up in

506
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
Houston

507
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,647
June 11th and 12th

508
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,463
What can we expect to see from Dell Technologies at the show

509
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,511
Dallas proud to be the headline

510
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
Again for this year's

511
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
Evangelion production

512
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,983
At this event you'll be able to see a completely integrated demonstration showing as the cord cop capabilities

513
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,287
Using our technology using data

514
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
Operating company

515
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,711
To get that next level of efficiencies and expose production improvements and next level

516
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
Crossword

517
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,015
Australian basketball

518
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,367
Thanks Chris where can people go to learn more about Dell iot

519
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:19,232
Text repository Stacy and people want to learn more about our Solutions

520
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,792
They can go to the Dell Technologies. Com

521
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
Flash IMDb

522
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:35,872
Back with another question about appliances this one is from Kevin but not this Kevin different Kevin

523
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,712
Kevin is worried like many of us are about leaving the stove on

524
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,504
Let's hear what he wants to do

525
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
ICC 7

526
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,368
I absolutely love you Kevin from Michigan

527
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
I was wondering

528
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,464
You yet answer this question Locker refrigerators

529
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,280
Freak out about my stove

530
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,352
Right now I have a wyze camera pointed at it

531
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,400
So I can just pop up

532
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,704
Eric B and see if my light is on

533
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,008
Is there a better way that I could

534
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,080
Monitor whether or not I leave my stove and oven on

535
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
Thanks a lot again love the show

536
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,664
Alright Kevin

537
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,992
I'm glad you're thinking trying to take care of your family

538
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,784
I got a couple options for you

539
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,880
This is a weird space because people have built stuff for it

540
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
And

541
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,232
Then it didn't sell because a lot of these are very expensive

542
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,536
So we discovered one

543
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584
Which is called Wallflower

544
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:33,728
And this is a device that will tell you that you have left your stove on it will not actually

545
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
Turn it off

546
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,824
Correct is just for notifications with food left it on

547
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:42,944
And the reason in this is an outlet so this is an outlet that you plug your stove into

548
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
It is

549
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,760
$150

550
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
It's called Wallflower Uke

551
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
You can find it at Wallflower.

552
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
And

553
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:55,232
If your home is built before 1996 you're going to need one if it's billed after you're going to need it if

554
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
But

555
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,048
The option is

556
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
Easy

557
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,888
The reason why an egg is actually to some of the things

558
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Behind

559
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
Stoves

560
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,520
It's actually from a regulatory perspective turning them off

561
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,824
Is apparently a big deal

562
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,152
So everybody who's like I'm going to do this and I'm going to turn it off

563
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,736
They realize when they start getting through certification process that

564
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,832
UL process or some sort of like hey is this thing safe to eat

565
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
Put my house

566
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:27,488
The Regulators don't like them because they they don't know if it's 100% over Wi-Fi that you can like

567
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,328
Luther motor and something will definitely be turned off they don't feel comfort

568
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
But

569
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,680
That has not stopped people from trying

570
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,960
So

571
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,288
The current one and I've seen a lot of these and none of them have

572
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,872
But there is currently one called a nerve

573
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,664
Ini RV

574
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,480
And they are building a connected

575
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Knob for your

576
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,064
Stove burner knobs

577
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
Western Gas and Electric

578
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,416
And what it does is you

579
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,744
Put these on and it has a sensor when your stove is on it will

580
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
Actually turn the knob

581
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
But

582
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
Here is the catch

583
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
They did a Kickstarter in 2017

584
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
It does not look like they've delivered on it

585
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,984
They were on Shark Tank

586
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
Can 2018

587
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,080
And just this year in February

588
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,408
They were part of the bsh techstars

589
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,456
Accelerator for the smart

590
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
What is this mean

591
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,064
It means that they've been promising a product for a long time

592
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:28,416
Only now do I feel like they have the backing they would need to actually

593
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Get it done

594
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:33,024
The techstars bsh accelerator program makes me feel like

595
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
A little bit more confidence but

596
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,376
It's still not enough confidence that I'm like

597
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
This is really going to happen

598
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
But

599
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,240
You can go on their website and reserve it

600
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,520
And

601
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
It doesn't cost

602
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,384
True it will be nice to see if and when they deliver

603
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,712
They actually have a shipping date people know cuz I I love the idea of this

604
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,016
We have a gas stove

605
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,040
So

606
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,856
I'm also really would do SWAT for us

607
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,696
Shut off the igniters I guess but really do anything else

608
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
So this is something I would

609
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,304
Consider looking into or trying but

610
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,840
It just isn't there yet

611
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,656
Yeah in the starter kit for the inner earth

612
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
Is

613
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,824
One sensor plus one knob is a hundred in all the way up to 1 sensor and four knobs which most stoves have four

614
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,872
And that's 230.

615
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,408
That's a lot of money

616
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
So it's a lot of money for peace of mind

617
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,064
Yeah we are almost in the territory to spend the money on it can I get stove

618
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,648
Oh my gosh and now we're back to that Cheeto your old Appliance

619
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,440
That's our new motto

620
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
Kitchen Redo for everyone

621
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,328
All right moving along to a question from John

622
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
I will confess I've never thought of

623
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
This problem so

624
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
Kudos to you John

625
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
Let's hear it

626
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
Swansea Illinois

627
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
Little bit concerned about

628
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,712
King Auto she devices throughout my home

629
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,296
Lightning strikes nearby

630
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
Power surges

631
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,368
Half power strips or

632
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,184
Interruptible power supplies for my computer

633
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
How concerned should I be about my

634
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,680
I'll be honest I actually haven't thought of this either

635
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,216
And maybe I should have

636
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,240
Especially on my

637
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
Higher price II

638
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,544
Tea devices

639
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,104
Something like a Google home Mini

640
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,176
It's not like throw away money to go buy one

641
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
You're talking

642
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,992
Maybe 30 bucks on sale so

643
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,576
I wouldn't be too concerned with things like that but if you have

644
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,112
Spend and you have to

645
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
Pick this number

646
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,672
That suits your budget

647
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
For me anything

648
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,256
Cost me more than $50 to replace

649
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
It might be worth

650
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
Getting

651
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,096
Surge protection for

652
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
So

653
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:49,472
Yeah baby webcam smart fit smart speakers hubs and so on so forth

654
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,776
I'm actually considering this now so I'm glad John

655
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
Assets

656
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:59,200
What I would say that there's tons if you go to Amazon there are tons of surge protector choices out there

657
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:03,808
I'm going to put one out because it's relatively inexpensive for what you're trying to

658
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Protect

659
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,136
Basically under 15 bucks gets you

660
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
Surge protector

661
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,488
That you plug in over top of an existing

662
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Outlet

663
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,584
And it actually adds more Outlets as well as USB ports

664
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,632
But you also get surge protection by that

665
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,728
So we'll put a link in the shown us this one I think is 13 $14

666
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,104
There are Bunches of them out there so maybe look at this one and then see what the other ones the related items are

667
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,408
Choose the ones that look the best to you or have the

668
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,456
He doesn't number of outlets you want so on

669
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,736
But for something

670
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
Inexpensive

671
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:37,344
Can I make a wyze cam I'm not going to put a surge protector on a wyzecam

672
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,928
It's almost as much money to put the surge protector on it cost me for the wyzecam so

673
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
That's my thought I don't know Stacey you may have a different opinion

674
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,816
I was just going to see if you wanted to

675
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
Brazy

676
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,680
This is maybe less for your smart home stuff also there some interesting options here

677
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
Get a smart surge protector

678
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,544
So there are definitely connected surge protectors out there but

679
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,872
If your homekit fan Eve has one called the energy strip

680
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
It is

681
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,200
Really pretty it works with Google Assistant

682
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,504
The reason you might want to do

683
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,528
Connected

684
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Surge

685
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,112
Is actually two

686
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
Set rules around like

687
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,488
When your smart devices are on like your smart speaker is

688
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
On or off

689
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
So you can maybe just

690
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,120
Not unplug it but basically

691
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Turn it off

692
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,168
Completely

693
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,752
That might get old for the speaker some things will

694
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,080
Need to be reset if you turn them off for too long of a Time

695
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,872
But it's an interesting option

696
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
Or you if you're really worried about life

697
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,504
Like privacy or things like that some people are like

698
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,064
You can set it up so your smart camera adjust

699
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,136
Is totally not even getting power when you come home

700
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
So

701
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
Even if Lake

702
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,976
The worst case scenario where the

703
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,560
The company was like I am really nefarious I'm going to take over your camera and look at you

704
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,144
Nautica cologne

705
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,192
So that might be a reason to get it

706
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:02,080
Although if they really wanted to see you then they could hack your connected surge protector and then turn the camera back up at 6

707
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,920
There's just throwing that out there is another app

708
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:11,552
It would you put surge protectors on any of your things or says not all of your things

709
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,952
In some places like my office I have surge protectors already in place and things are plugged into that by default

710
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
Discussed at the outlets

711
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
The lake

712
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
In my kitchen

713
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:26,912
My smart display which is 200 my Echo Show which was another 200 I think

714
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,960
Those are plugged into just normal

715
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:34,592
They're GFI outlets but that's about it what about your June cuz that would not be a inexpensive trip

716
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,200
You know it is not plugged into surge protector but neither is my $800 coffee May

717
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,272
Make her so clearly I'm just not consistent and that's not smart

718
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,392
So it looks like John as well as you and I will be spending some money answers for Tech

719
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
Stacy

720
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,024
I'm just like I've got renters insurance or home insurance

721
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,864
Next up we've got a question that we also get

722
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
Aaron

723
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:00,960
So

724
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,544
And everybody else

725
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,408
Yeah if we were playing if we were playing Q&A Bingo this would be like the Center Square

726
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
ICC and Kevin

727
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,528
My name is Aaron

728
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:18,368
Viability of

729
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,952
Crispy Sunday have no current price coming out

730
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232
Distracted

731
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,048
Suddenly disconnected doesn't work

732
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,352
Crysis 2

733
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:32,448
What you should transition to in the future or west bracket considered

734
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,728
Thank you and have a good day

735
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,080
I wish I had a better answer for you

736
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
Confer ferryman show

737
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
I sent wink

738
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
PR emails

739
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,504
I looked through Linkedin to see who I still do there

740
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,832
I sent another email to someone random that I

741
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
Was like

742
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,136
Third-degree connected to

743
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,720
I kid you not Stacy reaches out to these folks every couple weeks

744
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,024
And it's been going on for months it's not like

745
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
We have not tried to find out

746
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,864
But it's just a black hole

747
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
It is

748
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
So officially

749
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
I've got nothing

750
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,776
Unofficially I can tell you that the last update was

751
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Sports

752
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:13,152
Feels like a long time ago I also haven't heard from wink yet on the deprecation of

753
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
Nest

754
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:17,504
Where is all of my other smart home devices have sent me email saying

755
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,320
Hey did you hear the Google

756
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
You know

757
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,880
Killing Nest another like

758
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:28,256
Google's not killing us quite the same way but it's still going to happen so here's what you need to do

759
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,792
So I feel like

760
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
I can't recommend wink anymore to pee

761
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
People if you have wink

762
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,888
It still works

763
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,936
I'm in the same boat

764
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,264
To be honest I kind of feel it was my go-to Hub recommendations

765
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
So long

766
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,080
Overtime as

767
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,104
Nothing has

768
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
Come to light of what's going on

769
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,992
I don't feel comfortable recommending it

770
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,064
I will save it on the Google Play Store that the

771
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,344
Wink folks are

772
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,880
Responding

773
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,720
2 reviews with questions as early as 3 weeks ago

774
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
So it's not like

775
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:05,120
The total black hole there are still people there they're still working the wink hubs as you said Stacy still work

776
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,216
I think people just like wondering where there be new products what's the lunk

777
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:13,056
Strategy is there a long term for weighing what's going on really

778
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,152
Don't buy it for people thinking that

779
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,456
It's going to be around forever but for now

780
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,992
It does still work if you have it

781
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
Yay

782
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,112
If you want another Hub option I would sell you SmartThings

783
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Carter

784
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,184
I would also tell you maybe you don't need a

785
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,488
I know and I get angry emails.

786
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,584
Maybe you don't need a hug

787
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
If you're not a superpower user

788
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,680
Maybe Amazon or Google is

789
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
Perfectly good help for you

790
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
Okay

791
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:48,640
Let's move on to another question these are these are questions when you guys are answering them all he

792
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
Here because

793
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
We don't want you to think

794
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
But we don't listen

795
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,504
So this one is from Jeff

796
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,576
And he has a question about the mail

797
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
Let's hear it

798
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,416
Ice Age and Kevin Love You show

799
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
A question

800
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
Battle Wi-Fi

801
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,256
Mailbox alert

802
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,816
Back in the day

803
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,656
I was wondering if

804
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,240
Either something I can listen to that song that I have

805
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,288
Or something

806
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
Mailbox door has been open

807
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,152
After you could coverage

808
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,992
Mailbox WiFi

809
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,808
Support your answer

810
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,904
As you said we get this question a lot

811
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
And that's actually a good thing

812
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:37,792
Sometimes get the same question over and over because new products come out new Solutions are available

813
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:42,400
And this is a solution that I don't think we've recommended before because it's relatively new

814
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,424
I have to say

815
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,032
Jeff is like major old school with that RadioShack Melgar. I mean that is

816
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:52,128
Proprietary it's a light sensor that goes in the mailbox and

817
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,224
Send a chime into his house and

818
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:02,368
It is but it's against proprietary and does his question how can I connect this to Wi-Fi

819
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,160
The short answer is you can't

820
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
Unfortunately not easily

821
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:09,024
But we may have an alternative that's not terribly expensive

822
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,840
What weight should we explain why WI-Fi is proper

823
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,376
Play not everyone's First Choice here

824
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,472
Well yes we should because most mailboxes are

825
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:21,056
Probably Faraday cages was really hard to get a signal out

826
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:25,408
But the proprietary frequencies are typically in the 900 megahertz range

827
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,968
Which can travel better through

828
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,296
The Trap better through metal in walls and they also travel further

829
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:37,952
Yeah Wi-Fi is a shorter wavelength frequency at 2.4 and an even shorter at 5

830
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,256
Yes and what's happening is

831
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
The Spectre

832
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:46,400
Can't make it through or it can't make it as far and then the other eye thing to think about there is

833
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,936
A lot of them

834
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
Wi-Fi sucks a lot of

835
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Battery power

836
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
Exactly

837
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,800
However

838
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,104
Jeff says he has good

839
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,920
Wi-Fi range maybe the signals

840
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,992
The Wi-Fi device inside of the mailbox can get through

841
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,784
So what we're going to recommend

842
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,088
Is he considered one of the new

843
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
Blink

844
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,624
Cameras

845
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,208
That runs on the battery for up to two years is still Wi-Fi

846
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,792
You get a one camera system and async module

847
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,328
Two connected to

848
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,352
You are network for

849
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,376
$80

850
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,424
If you put that in the place of your Milgard

851
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,752
And you can get a signal from it through your mailbox

852
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,776
You're in good shape

853
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:28,640
There's no way we can guarantee that because we don't know the distance of your mailbox is your mailbox made of

854
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
Half-inch thick metal

855
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,992
Cardboard I have no idea

856
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,528
We don't know for sure

857
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
If it will work

858
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,624
This is probably the best option

859
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,160
I've seen in awhile for

860
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
Very specific

861
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,768
Circumstances wherever Wi-Fi monitoring system for a mailbox

862
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
Could work

863
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
Agreed

864
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:53,472
And we also tried the wise sensors I'll just throw this out here for you because they're cheap and 40 bucks get you

865
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
What you might need

866
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,104
We found that the Hub could not be located more than about

867
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,896
3240 ft

868
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,176
Through a front door

869
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
So

870
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,992
I don't know if that's going to work

871
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:09,600
But before the show Stacy marked outside of her house with her

872
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,880
License and

873
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
Measure

874
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,744
Open and closed it several times to see how far it would go

875
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,840
Chick that would be ideal because again that's low power battery and so on

876
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,656
It might work in Jeff's case again I don't know where his

877
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,960
Mailbox is it might be just outside is

878
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,496
Front door I don't know

879
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:32,128
Down if your cameras like right by your front window or something so the wireless is a little better cuz this was

880
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,528
Right this is sub gigahertz so somewhere in 900 maybe 4:15 gigahertz is what the why sensors are using

881
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,064
So you know

882
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,832
Might

883
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
Work

884
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,904
And is cheap if you want to try it so

885
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,696
Those are the options I wish I had like a

886
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,488
2 Cool Wi-Fi photo sensor that

887
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,536
Would be magically able to work but

888
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
That is not an option

889
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
All right

890
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,704
Moving right along with another question for Wi-Fi

891
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,240
Stem cell

892
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,032
This is from Daniel let's hear it

893
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:04,640
Hey guys I just want to say I really love the show about Amazon Echo

894
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
What a year ago

895
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,736
Can you guys the show I guess

896
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,040
11

897
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
1011

898
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,136
And I listen to every Thursday

899
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,928
My question is

900
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
What the best setup

901
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,256
For your Wi-Fi router

902
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,792
The safest setup

903
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,376
Some people say that of the land

904
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:29,216
Is the best I've heard other people say they like a guest network is the best

905
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,008
So I just wanted to ask

906
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,544
Canyon Honda

907
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,336
I don't have any

908
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,872
Zigbee or Z-Wave device

909
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,408
This is all my Google assist

910
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
Alexis

911
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
Cloudbase

912
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
We get this question a lot

913
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,320
Today's router settings networks aren't meant

914
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,600
Really to

915
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,184
Protect iot devices specifically at me never meant to protect

916
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,976
You from

917
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,024
The outside world getting in in general

918
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,096
Honestly you could use a guest Network

919
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,936
We talked about that before you can use the guest Network for all of your devices

920
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
That is an option

921
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,288
That's kind of locked on little bit more than say your

922
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
Standard Network

923
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:11,200
That you could look into their there certain products out there we looked into and talked about before the bitdefender Box

924
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,272
Is $199 at 6 behind your router

925
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:20,928
I'm supposed to help filter traffic and watch for suspicious network activity so maybe if your attitude devices are going out to someone

926
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,232
It might work

927
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,536
I guess we're not really big fans of that though because

928
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,096
We've never really seen detail testing

929
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,632
To show that it better

930
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,192
I've tried some of the stuff

931
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:32,960
And

932
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,008
It does work I just

933
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
I don't know if my life is

934
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,616
Yeah cuz I feel like right now I'm not

935
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,664
I should say that I'm not being attacked

936
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,736
So a part of this is you know part of your wrist Pro

937
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,552
I will say the nicest feature that I

938
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,904
I'd like to have and I think you should have it although I think it should be free personally

939
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,440
Is understanding

940
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,720
What devices are on your

941
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,280
And getting a notification with something

942
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
Get on your knees

943
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
So

944
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,168
Yeah which do you use I forgot to say gyro I have to Eero

945
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
Service

946
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,728
Soon I will be up in

947
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:09,824
Comcast service area and I'll try there is but like Eero does let me know it's like

948
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,872
This weird device has joined your dad

949
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
Cool thanks

950
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
Super weird device

951
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,808
Can I use Google Wi-Fi

952
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:26,208
You don't have to pay for that type of information but it's it's passive however you actually have to open the app and

953
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,000
See what devices are on your network

954
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:31,072
So it's not like it notifies you when something

955
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,864
Has joined it doesn't

956
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:39,520
Proactively tell you that there's a new device or any like that so I periodically go through that cuz sometimes I even find

957
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,544
Devices that we

958
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,336
Sold or recycled

959
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:46,176
Better still cortical attached to that we're going to clean those out

960
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:49,504
But there's nothing automatic about that notifications either

961
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:56,416
That's the one thing the other thing I would say is if I were doing this all again from scratch

962
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
And I will

963
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,744
I would set up

964
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:00,768
My network

965
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:06,400
And I would set up all my iot devices on that and I would also have my guest Network

966
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,984
And nobody but me and maybe my husband

967
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,008
Because I do travel

968
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,312
We'll get the password for the

969
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,592
The cornet

970
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,152
And everybody else including my child will be on the

971
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:22,272
And the reason I will do that is because my child is going to give out our guest Network

972
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
Password Oliver

973
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
Friends

974
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:27,136
Also because children download all kinds of weird stuff

975
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,744
I don't know where it's tough to but kids

976
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,024
Kids are like oh yeah

977
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
I totally need this

978
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,376
So no friends are coming over to your house when you move I got it

979
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,936
No no no they just get the guest Network

980
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:46,592
You know when you're buying a mesh wi-fi system make sure that it has easy Euro basically if I what I can

981
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,640
I just go into the app and I'm like

982
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,456
I said I can text you I can email you

983
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
I guess Network

984
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:57,344
Be kind of cool if I could show you a QR code on my phone and you just snap it and get on the Wi-Fi

985
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
Add that

986
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,672
Are you hearing me Eero

987
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,000
That's the other network Safeguard I would save

988
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,584
It's not necessarily the security products but it's just a nice best

989
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,632
And if anybody has

990
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,704
Purchased a device or a service

991
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,728
2

992
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,288
Help with this I would actually like to hear about the

993
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
The clothes back

994
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,360
We've had some people tell us what they do but

995
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,128
Again

996
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:24,224
They're always new Services new products coming out and it's been awhile since we've address this question

997
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
So

998
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,576
It could be that I have not been on the up-and-up with what's going on in this in this place

999
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
Kevin manno

1000
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
All right

1001
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,768
Our next color isn't actually a color it's someone who emails

1002
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,536
And

1003
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,120
Really felt uncomfortable leaving a voicemail so

1004
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
Out loud

1005
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,568
I wonder if you could help me find a solution to this scenario

1006
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,711
I have a tablet that is always on connected to power and is showing a web page with actiontiles control

1007
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:01,599
I want to be able to see the video for my ring Pro doorbell when there is motion or somebody presses the doorbell button

1008
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,391
Or when I issue a voice command

1009
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
Like

1010
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
Anime

1011
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,463
Show me the front door

1012
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:12,863
Currently my tablet is not an Amazon Fire tablet but I would consider replacing it if the Fire tablet can do what I want

1013
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,703
I know the Amazon show can display the video from The Ring

1014
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,495
But I don't like the price of the show

1015
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,847
Totally fair comment about the

1016
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,663
Amazon show I'm just not a fan of that device in general

1017
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,943
And not just cuz of the price

1018
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,503
Baptist don't care for it even though I have some smart displays

1019
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,783
Illusion

1020
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,575
That's fine if you buy everything that

1021
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,623
Amazon shows list you or whatever

1022
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,415
That's all you

1023
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:41,279
This was interesting to me because I didn't know about actiontiles which as Kira looks like as a web-based

1024
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,071
Customizable

1025
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,399
Bunch of tiles that would show a title for each one of your smart home devices

1026
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:51,007
It's really made for SmartThings he didn't mention that I don't think it was anything else

1027
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,543
So I'm assuming you a smart thing

1028
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,895
Because it's web-based it works with just about any tablet or phone so you can even use an iPad

1029
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,967
But that's not going to solve the problem

1030
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,759
Backhero has posed to us

1031
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
So

1032
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,087
A Fire tablet I hate to say is

1033
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,391
Probably the best at lowest cost

1034
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,695
However

1035
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,255
Lenovo actually makes a smart

1036
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,303
Tab which is also an Android tablet

1037
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,863
Comes in two sizes 8 or 10 in

1038
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
And

1039
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,935
Similar lucky Rose doing

1040
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,751
Carol has his tablet always plugged in

1041
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,055
This includes a speaker dock

1042
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,871
And when you put the Smart Tab in the speaker dock

1043
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,943
You essentially transform it into an Echo Show

1044
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,991
And at that point you can ask

1045
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,527
Madame A2

1046
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,087
Show your ring or do whatever you need her to do

1047
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,439
They start around 199 go up to 350 depending on the specs

1048
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:46,815
So obviously much more expensive than your Fire HD is what you can get sometimes for 50 bucks

1049
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,375
But if you want a decent tablet

1050
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:54,751
That you can actually take out of a dog have a charge uses a tablet and then put it back in to use it as an Echo Show

1051
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,519
It's a nice

1052
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,287
Option

1053
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,567
I will say

1054
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,895
Because it's an Android tablet the native default

1055
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,687
Assistant is Google

1056
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,479
So when it is not.

1057
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,319
If you ask it a question only Google is going to listen and answer

1058
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
If you put it

1059
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,623
In the dark

1060
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,439
Then that of a will be the default so

1061
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:18,303
I like this because it gives you a wider range of options if you just want a tablet that you're

1062
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,607
It's going to show your ring doorbell

1063
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,143
Go for the Fire HD tablet

1064
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,935
If you want something

1065
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,983
Is much more flexible

1066
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,031
I consider this if your budget allows

1067
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
All right

1068
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,127
Carol hope that answers your

1069
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,663
All right
