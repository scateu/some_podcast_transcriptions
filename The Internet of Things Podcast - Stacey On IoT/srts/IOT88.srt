Okay Kevin

37
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,328
Stacy

38
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,656
Start off with in the certification front

39
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,704
Bluetooth 5 is out

40
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
What aspect this is

41
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,544
So Bluetooth is the

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
For those of you guys who

43
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,896
I don't know don't know it it is in your phone

44
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,688
It is in like

45
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,760
Your wearables in speakers it's basically

46
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,552
Really low data rate

47
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,648
And a really short distance Wireless

48
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
So things don't go very far

49
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
I don't really go super fast

50
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
But

51
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
That's changes

52
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
So Bluetooth 5 this spec

53
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
Has

54
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,240
Lots of new things the biggest things it's going to have that you guys are going to notice

55
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
Is it's going to be

56
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
Longer-range

57
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,176
Right now Bluetooth says that it's devices can go out to

58
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,504
The current Bluetooth stack goes out to about a hundred meters

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,320
I personally find it actually goes to about 20

60
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
If that

61
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,440
Yeah it depends on so many different things

62
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,024
Basically Engineers are going to have the choice of

63
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,816
Increasing the range

64
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
At

65
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
The risk of

66
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
Decreasing throughput

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,192
So basically the farther out it is

68
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,472
The slower the data

69
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Which is an

70
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
Terrible because

71
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,872
You don't you might not be able to do audio but you could do notify

72
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
Applications

73
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:34,528
It's actually I think perfect for synchronizing wearables and

74
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,088
Getting iot notifications as you said

75
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
Because of short bursts of information they're they're not

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
Filled with data

77
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
So

78
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
You don't need a lot of

79
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
Truth what you just need

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
And then you

81
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,400
I love it because I have a Bluetooth ring

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
Talk to my phone

83
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,288
And it's great except for if my phone's a little too far away it no longer work

84
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,872
Works also good for light bulbs bluetooth light bulbs right now

85
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
If you're in your house

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,504
You know you could too far from your light bulb you can actually turn it off for the phone and then you're like

87
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
This was dumb

88
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
Borax

89
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
The range

90
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
Yay

91
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,000
The other thing that we should be excited about is there's going to be a little speed boost

92
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:22,399
And this will be great for things like when your syncing data or doing updates to like a wearable from your phone it'll just be a little bit

93
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Pastor

94
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,495
You don't have to sit there looking to screen going sinking device

95
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
Loading

96
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
Bloating

97
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,943
Those things are great to know the other thing that is

98
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,759
Advertising rates and I kind of wish they didn't

99
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,599
Call it this but basically with Bluetooth beacons what happens is

100
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
They call it advertising

101
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,439
Pekin will send out a signal to your phone

102
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,487
And the phone then says

103
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,815
Here's a URL in the case of like Google ID Stone

104
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
Once every object have

105
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
URL

106
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,983
Or if you're in a store at might be like 50% off shoes cuz I'm standing near the shoes

107
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,127
What's going to happen here is there increasing the amount of data that can be sent by 8

108
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
Time switches

109
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
Much

110
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,223
Richer so instead of just being like

111
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
You're Something

112
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
Now to be like

113
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
You're Something here's a picture that something

114
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
There's a lot of data about that something

115
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
The way they're calling it advertising

116
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:24,351
Yeah but I I sort of understand why because there's been broadcasting

117
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,911
It's an ad obviously many can be used for ads but

118
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,727
They're their advertising that something is available

119
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
Write what we matter what is

120
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
Data picture a URL

121
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,383
So I sort of get that I just wish they'd called

122
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
Broadcasting

123
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Then maybe people

124
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
Still probably not enough

125
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:47,391
Right right right right that's that's going to be really interesting because I think it'll

126
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
I really think there's a lot of potential

127
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
With broadcasting via Bluetooth

128
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,071
Especially if it's not just

129
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,727
Things broadcasting at your phone but your phone broadcasting out because think of all the preference data you could keep on your phone

130
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
You know you could have learned a restaurant to say

131
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Hey I have an allergy

132
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,663
Like when you get in there at your table they could be like table 10 has

133
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Nut allergy

134
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,527
Which is really actually kind of

135
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Cool and interesting

136
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
We're not there yet

137
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
And actually

138
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:24,511
And say this is not there yet it is this is aspect onata not a natural product so people are going to see the speck

139
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
Introduced in Bluetooth products

140
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,631
They say within two to six months is the expectation so

141
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,727
Don't expect all these changes in your next Bluetooth device if you go out tomorrow night 1

142
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
If you go out

143
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,543
Next year in by when

144
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
And some of them

145
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,687
A lot of the speed and throughput and range things are chip

146
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,551
Related so a lot of things go has been floating around for a while

147
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,599
So some of the chip makers have

148
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
Already built

149
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
Products

150
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
Should be

151
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
Yeah I was actually just going to

152
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
Say this may not

153
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
I mean you need to buy a new device if you

154
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,375
If you want to take advantage Bluetooth but

155
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,191
You're you're going to hang that depends on the bed

156
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
Do not disturb

157
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
Alright so album

158
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
Actually I am going to assume

159
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:16,735
I assume that there will be demonstrations of this technology at CES

160
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
There are going to have

161
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
Apple Bluetooth

162
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
Whole Foods with Arena

163
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
As they often do

164
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,951
Experience the Bluetooth experience

165
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,255
The final thing that they are

166
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,815
Doing with Bluetooth which is worth noting

167
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,399
For all of you guys who are frustrated with the pairing experience

168
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
They are

169
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,263
Rapping over 400 known

170
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,823
Issues with Bluetooth into the spec

171
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,127
And people now have the option to

172
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
Fix them

173
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,991
So if you've had a device that just doesn't seem to work

174
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
Distracted

175
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,855
And they've wrap that in here so you can hopefully

176
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
Not have that experience

177
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,999
Going for it so it's also

178
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
I've done some Spectrum

179
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,863
Management kind of techniques in here so basically

180
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,679
Your Bluetooth won't interfere with your LTE

181
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
Things are going to be a little bit more efficient

182
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
In

183
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
Terms of

184
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
Set the channels they're using for sin

185
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,151
These are really highly technical things in

186
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,735
The idea behind it is basically that when you pair your going to be able to pair

187
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,551
Any Bluetooth device to any Bluetooth device

188
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,623
And it's not going to interfere with other wireless devices

189
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:34,047
Kind of the way it should be. You shouldn't have to

190
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
You got to adjust

191
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Totally agree

192
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
So

193
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
Big big

194
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
News

195
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,263
From Google what hole

196
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
What's the new Google home

197
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,895
Connected speaker digital assistant

198
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,687
Is finally at

199
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
Home features

200
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Or a

201
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,319
I don't know what to call it it's not a skill

202
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,647
It's a waiver developers disconnect

203
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,511
Products to Google home so now you should be able to control a wide variety

204
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
BF things

205
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Through Google home

206
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
So

207
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
It's a developer program

208
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
Google home

209
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,727
Details are scant as we're recording this

210
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
But it is

211
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,567
Going to be one of the big missing pieces

212
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
That Google home had compared to the

213
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
Amazon Echo

214
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
And

215
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,735
There are lots of companies that are coming out with

216
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
Chatbots

217
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,831
Waste Control devices and so this should be

218
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Actually pretty cool

219
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
I can't wait

220
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:38,047
Yeah this is good news to me because it's one of the reasons I didn't buy a Google home and back I just bought 1/4

221
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
Echo yesterday or

222
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,399
Just received it yesterday because of all the

223
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,983
Things that work with it all the services that you can use with it

224
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,311
I can't do that with a home so I've kind of held off

225
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
You might be purchasing a

226
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:57,503
I just might as I I didn't even this last week in my newsletter

227
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Which guys

228
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
Stacey on iot

229
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
DACA

230
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
You should sign up for

231
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,695
I talked about the challenges of the voice ecosystem

232
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,231
Because right now we are

233
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
Is there something in this place where I'd like

234
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,095
Oh do I ask she who shall not be named

235
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
Or should I ask

236
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,519
It's funny you say that because I've seen a couple videos putting around with people have

237
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,359
A Google home talking to an echo talking

238
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
Go to Siri in like a loop

239
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
The talking to each other

240
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
Eric white circles are awesome

241
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
And

242
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
I have not said anything up like that beat

243
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Because I

244
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
Don't want to annoy me

245
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
Yes

246
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Crazy

247
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
But

248
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
I will say that it is

249
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
My poor daughter is like

250
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,887
Okay see you should not be named play this or do this and I'm like no.

251
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
You got a school

252
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
And she's like

253
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,335
Samurai

254
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,711
Also I spent this week testing

255
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:05,087
Various light bulbs with both the home and the echo through different platform

256
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
Because I'm Batman

257
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
That's what I do in my spare time you guys

258
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,047
A lot of people told me they felt the Google home with Snappy

259
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
In

260
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,119
I actually did not

261
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
Have that Xperia

262
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,703
Actually was about the same

263
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
When chewing

264
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
So

265
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,567
Philips Hue on both is integrated

266
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
Directly to both

267
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,895
In Philips Hue same

268
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Exact

269
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Response time

270
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
As I would Excel

271
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,343
What is cool with Google home is you can say

272
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
Hey hey G

273
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,695
Turn my living room lights pink

274
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
And that works

275
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
In your living room lights turn

276
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,607
What I did notice though is it doesn't recognize

277
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
The scene

278
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,703
So any of the scenes you say to

279
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Google home

280
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
Didn't work

281
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
Now

282
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
The echo

283
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
Does not do colors

284
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
But it does do

285
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
See

286
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
I know

287
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,807
Okay so she won't seem to need to talk to this device

288
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
Message McCullers you talk to that device

289
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,671
This is what a wonderful future we live in

290
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
So there's

291
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
That

292
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
So that was the Philips Hue experience humble

293
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,839
Then I connected SmartThings

294
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,375
With a couple light bulbs

295
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
To the echo

296
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
Because not everybody wants

297
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
Wichita

298
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
And

299
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,359
3 smart things you can control osram lightify you control

300
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Cree

301
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,687
And you can control lifx lights

302
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,759
And all of those actually worked really well in

303
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
Very quickly

304
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
Through Google home

305
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,135
Which is again a native support thing it's not

306
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:49,279
It's not like using if this then that or something else that would add attention rain

307
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,351
So you're doing Google SmartThings

308
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Issue

309
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
Right

310
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
So that was kind of fun

311
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,775
You can also control SmartThings through the echo

312
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Also

313
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,967
Google Assistant has supposedly done something with if this then that so it's a lot

314
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Faster

315
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,551
I have yet to encounter that with

316
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,623
And that could be wink

317
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
We could be at going through

318
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
I'm not real sure

319
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
Cuz when I did the wink

320
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Moonshine

321
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
Ifft

322
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Too many moving parts

323
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
A protein which is fine

324
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
I totally expected you know

325
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
That's that's a lot of

326
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,639
That was kind of delighting experience of all of

327
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
I really liked

328
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:44,831
Color-changing thing on the Google home with the Hues that was kind of fun and nice

329
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
Pretty sure

330
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:52,511
There has to be weighed maybe if I named the rooms in Google after something like dinner party I

331
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
I could set some more

332
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Definitive settings

333
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
Objects.

334
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,727
Cuz it would be nice to say you know like at cuz I have an echo thing

335
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
Dinner party

336
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,799
And that's already set but that's through.

337
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,663
I guess I could do it through SmartThings scenes through smart

338
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,271
The good old days of a physical switch and wire

339
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
Okay

340
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,671
Movie Ride Along that was that was that experience for those of you guys who are

341
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Looking at that

342
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,143
Well actually it is very telling though it tells you that we can talk about all the stuff

343
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
For several years but

344
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,751
It's still maturing it's still not where it needs to be

345
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,591
Lots of services Latta devices lots of interfaces

346
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
Yasso

347
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,711
That is actually killing all right

348
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
Personal assistant in the home front

349
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,319
Wired had a wonderful article

350
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
These guys recording app

351
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Can you say

352
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:58,559
You're freaked out about that probably shouldn't buy one but if you're freaked out about it and you want to delete your stuff the article which I weigh

353
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Building 2

354
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
Offers you lovely tips

355
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Which is nice

356
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
Indonesia

357
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,495
The ability to delete your

358
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,079
Voice recordings has been available on a lot of these services

359
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
Beginning for privacy reasons

360
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
I want people to be secure

361
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,271
It's kind of funny to me you buy these devices that are always listening

362
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
Or you wouldn't buy them

363
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Obviously

364
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:25,951
And then you go and delete your recording history but you know what you just going to fill it up again

365
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
Okay hold on a second

366
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,143
Let's not say that at all

367
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
Okay alright.

368
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
If one were to

369
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,031
Have something like that

370
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
Delete that directly

371
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
You know this is how you

372
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
So

373

Are you really that lazy that you wouldn't type it in somewhere supposed to speaking it out

00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,343
How to get away with murder

375
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
So

376
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,183
That's okay I'm just I'm just saying

Search delete

Hear recordings after

00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,351
You delete your saved audio clips after the fact

380
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,679
You have to go to my activity. Google.com

381
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,775
Tap the three vertical dots in the myactivity titlebar

382
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543

Bye

All products

387
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
Click the all products drop down menu

388
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,479
Choose voice and audio and then

389
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
Now

390
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,879
Dismay infection of Google homes personalization features because it essentially wipes its

391
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,999
And that's right that's why you want to leave this on because it gets better

392
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767

395
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,119
You know all of these things help it

396
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Better so

397
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
But

398
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
It's adoption

399
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,287
Before the echo you have to visit amazon.com

400
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Slash

401
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591

402
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
Click the year devices tab

Select your Echo device and click manage voice recording

404
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,039
A popup message should appear and clicking delete

405
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575

406
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,183

In case you weren't

409
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,535
Did you not have a pen and pencil handy to write on that day

410
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,351
But it's possible

411
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
And

412
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
There you go

413
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,703
One more little thing I just want to mention it be

414
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,103
Okay I'm not

415
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,151
Weird she who shall not be named

416
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
The Voice service

417
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,527
Will show you a picture

418
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
It's like a

419
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
What did you say

420
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
Credit score

421
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,695
It's like a quidditch goal it's a round light

422
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
Yes around lights

423
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
That stands on its side

424
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,583
Ion little bass and it has

425
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631
People Services of

426
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
Her built-in

427
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:49,823
It just looks weird to me the price they sale will be lower in cost than

428
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
Traditional Echo

429
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
Which is $180

430
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:59,295
You know sitting on someone's bedside table and if this has the function of like the GE

431
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Lights

432
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
You know our

433
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,183
That work with circadian rhythms maybe this is

434
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,999
Kissing a baby

435
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
And we love it

436
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
Samso

437
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,351
No late don't need a light

438
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,935
So this kind of consolidate baidu

439
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
And it sits on a WeMo switch and I can

440
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,311
Until.the. To shut the light off iPhone is really cool

441
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
But it looks

442
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,943
But my light looks like a light not a quidditch goal

443
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,295
Okay so we just wanted to mention that

444
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
Because

445
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
Dang it looks funny

446
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,647
Would be curious about y'all's opinion

447
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
All right

448
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,023
Big news coming from Amazon

449
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,327
Kevin you want to talk about this

450
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:50,495
Yes this is the reason I am finally going to make a trip out to Seattle I think just to go buy a can of tuna fish

451
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
Amazon

452
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
Go

453
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
The

454
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,639
Prototype store of the future was just

455
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,687
Announce a couple days ago

456
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
And it's

457
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
It's a very interesting concept

458
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,855
It reduces friction for shopping because there is no checkout line

459
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,159
There's only a check in line with sounds

460
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
Kind of weird

461
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:13,791
But if you think about it you check into the supermarket with Amazon go use your smartphone

462
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,119
You then go and grab whatever off the shelves

463
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
But you want to buy you just put it in your little

464
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Bag

465
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
And you walk out

466
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
When you're done

467
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,519
What happens is

468
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Through

469
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
They call it a I but

470
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
I'm assuming it's a lot of sensors

471
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
Cameras and so on

472
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,967
Whatever you buy whatever you put in your bag or your

473
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
Your card

474
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
Is automatically

475
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,319
Tallied up in a shopping list and

476
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,927
You pay for it through Amazon in the app you could receipt right if you walk out of the store

477
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
So there's no checkout at all I just

478
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,767
Magically Hotel mini bar fridge with

479
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
The sensors in it

480
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
Only

481
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
Grocery store

482
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
And not everything has liquor in it

483
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
Astoria

484
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,775
So what yeah I think this is

485
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
Awesome

486
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,383
I'm very curious like how much it cost per square foot

487
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,919
This is

488
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
You don't just

489
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
But that time is it

490
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,343
It's also going to be raining right now grocery store margins are at 3

491
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
3%

492
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
So this

493
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,511
Eliminate some of the labor cost I think kind of

494
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,815
Illuminates like Checkers and that sort of thing

495
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
To a certain extent I'm sure they're still good

496
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
Happy helpers

497
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
In the story to help

498
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
Define things

499
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
But

500
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,751
It also

501
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,311
Has technical cost that I'm unsure of

502
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
Wright's Auto

503
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
Who's

504
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:36,479
Affixing night I assume it's RFID labels but who's affixing those whose

505
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,807
Packaging cost how much did those go up

506
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,111
I love the idea I'm very excited as a

507
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,647
Consumer but I'm like Boo

508
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,439
How does the Shifty economics

509
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,583
Yeah but you know what it's an Amazon approach they don't worry so much about the

510
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,375
Costs in the margins and all that

511
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,679
You're buying a lot of their products there

512
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,239
Other electronics like a Kindle

513
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:04,127
As a Gateway for you to buy more things so you might be getting the devices at cost or less right

514
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:09,247
So it's it's a typical Amazon approach and what I sort of like about it is

515
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,575
A they want to own the customer experience which is Central to

516
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
Amazon

517
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
And

518
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
Secondly

519
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
I think they're tired of waiting

520
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
4

521
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,768
Beacons and all kinds of other Technologies

522
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:25,632
To be implemented in stores in a mish-mosh way interested to know what we're going to show you how to do it cuz we can

523
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
I need it

524
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,216
And I can't wait for the day that I go in and bye-bye

525
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,520
My kind of Cherry Garcia

526
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,336
And a bottle of wine when I get home Amazon

527
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,896
You look like you need a rom-com Stacy

528
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,712
How about Sleepless in Seattle

529
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,784
Exercise TV

530
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
So

531
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
Brave New World

532
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,440
Alright let's see what else do we have we have

533
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Fitbit

534
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,280
Can we all mourn for a moment

535
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,328
Because market and reports that

536
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,144
Well it's part of the deal where Fitbit is buying

537
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Pebble for

538
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,216
Reported 40 million dollars now this is all

539
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Still in the rumored stage

540
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
This has not been

541
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Satellite

542
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
But the latest news

543
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
This

544
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,760
Piece of news is that backers of the pebble time 2

545
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
And the

546
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
Core

547
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,392
I'll probably just going to get a refund instead of their device

548
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,232
It's sad you know how excited

549
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
Core which was

550
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,328
It was going to have the Amazon Echo

551
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,912
Services and Spotify

552
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,496
So I could just take this tiny little iPod Nano looking device on my

553
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Send off

554
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,568
I remember

555
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
I don't think that's happening

556
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:46,272
I was so excited that I think about it everyday while walking

557
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
My dog

558
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,368
There's another there was another Kickstarter project actually

559
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,560
You know it's it is it's really sad in the sense that pebble

560
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:04,704
Not to use this as a pun though about it but I'm going to say it they can be essentially kick-started the wearables market here

561
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
Literally and figuratively

562
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,032
And

563
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:13,152
They've done some really nice work in the space that got some great products that aren't too expensive

564
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:18,528
And to be honest of the kind of products that aren't overly complicated to the appeal to a mass audience

565
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
But

566
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:24,160
I don't know the economics of their particular challenges but apparently they've been

567
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,464
Hurting for money and letting people go and

568
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,256
Fitbit is also another very

569
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
Popular and successful

570
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,584
Demon is Faison

571
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,752
It's especially sad because Pebble actually had in 2015 and offer for 740

572
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
$10

573
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
And this was from watchmaker

574
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
Citizen

575
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
Which

576
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
And then

577
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:49,760
In until had made a reported offer of 70 million

578
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,064
Right before the launch of the pebble 2

579
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,880
So that was that was Intel's effort

580
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,208
The CEO just was like nope we got it

581
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
And so

582
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,304
I guess he does not happen

583
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,864
I would hate to be a CEO

584
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
An offer like that I mean you're just like

585
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,776
I mean cuz you don't start a company thinking well

586
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,336
Play some people start companies thinking someone will just buy the

587
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,384
But you start a company because you were right

588
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
We all miss you got to have

589
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,736
Crazy confidence crazy belief

590
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
And then to say

591
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Okay

592
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
Ocelot to you

593
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,160
Looking for Dennis Duffy

594
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
Dropcam to neston

595
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
Really regretted

596
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
So

597
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
They're sure

598
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,584
Children and negative stories always ReSound

599
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
Much more

600
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,656
You waited much more heavily

601
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
So

602
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
Here is that tire

603
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
Pebble news

604
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
So sorry you guys I

605
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
We can have like a little

606
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
Lots of people fans out there

607
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,384
Yeah okay

608
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:55,296
Chew other qwikbetz a news there is a brand new energy monitoring device is not going to be out until 2017 but

609
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
What I'm talking about it

610
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
Because I

611
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,672
I think it's probably the Least Complicated energy monitoring device out there

612
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
Well it's not out there

613
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
And that's why I want

614
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:07,328
That's why I won't work because this looks very simple

615
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,352
Works in

616
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
They bought a company called

617
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
Whisker

618
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Laughs

619
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
And

620
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,496
Through this they're doing

621
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,360
It basically looks like a stick on thing that you stick on your circuit box

622
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
Roxanne

623
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
It starts measuring

624
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,944
Electricity

625
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
You spy your devices in you

626
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,576
The details are little late right now so in the product

627
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,600
Actually

628
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,160
Arrives I'll be very curious how they're doing that

629
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:38,816
With just like a box on the circuit breaker

630
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,840
Sum of the measure

631
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
This actually gets into light

632
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,168
Ocean noises

633
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,728
We'll just call it a fancy out

634
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,544
Has been tested

635
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,848
There's different ways of doing your fancy outdoor

636
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,408
Actually talked to hit like Mario

637
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
Curb

638
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,504
Those guys felt like how they're doing it

639
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
And

640
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Yeah

641
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,624
Verdigre is another company that does this

642
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,488
Did you have something installed in your circuit

643
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
Curb yes

644
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,912
Actually one of them to come out

645
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
I didn't pay for it

646
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,312
So when I test a device

647
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
Sugar Act

648
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,200
I think it was $650

649
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,992
Pair device in your

650
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Circuit

651
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,320
Foxo1 device measured

652
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
1 Circle

653
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
Can I have 3

654
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
So

655
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,464
Yeah that's the stuff I not cheap

656
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,048
And I do remember looking at these folks as I install their app

657
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,680
Because it works with the green button which is a initiative to get your actual energy data

658
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,728
From your electricity provider and

659
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,824
There for you match the two data points and you learn more about your energy usage so

660
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,152
Fortune my provider is not supported so I don't use curb

661
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,992
Someday Maybe

662
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,320
This week a device called

663
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,344
Plume

664
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,672
Launched this is plume WiFi

665
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,208
This is

666
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,536
A twist it Twist on the idea of mesh Network

667
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:17,120
Working these are tiny little pods that you stick around your home

668
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,168
Traditionally with a router

669
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
And things like that you Rose

670
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:25,312
Mesh networks or a traditional router you have kind of a brain

671
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,872
In your router that handles the routing tasks

672
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,664
And you have the radios

673
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,528
What happens with blue Ms you have the radios but the brain lives in the

674
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Cloud

675
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
So

676
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,624
Each one of these pods

677
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,440
Is plugged into an outlet

678
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:47,072
In your home and you're supposed to have in a three-bedroom home should have six to eight plumes

679
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,888
And Kevin you should probably get the pricing while I

680
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
If you don't mind

681
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,496
Yes actually pretty expensive if I recall

682
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
But I'll get the exact

683
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
So these are

684
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
In your house and they

685
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:06,272
Adapt to how you use your Wi-Fi network so I actually installed mine but I was kind of late on my insta

686
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,344
So I'm not going to talk about how it's working

687
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
Because

688
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
I'm supposed to let it sit for

689
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,184
Take a couple days

690
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,024
It kind of learn a little bit more before

691
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
I start doing

692
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
Performance testing so what I can tell you

693
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:26,752
Is the install itself they have an IOS and Android app if you have the ability to install it using I

694
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,336
IOS do it because the Android app is pretty bare-bones

695
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,616
It takes about

696
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,896
Maybe

697
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,176
15 minutes in a day

698
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:39,552
It's me running around upstairs

699
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,344
So you basically

700
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
You plug it into your

701
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,696
You plug the first one into your router

702
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
Into the wall

703
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,584
I will say I had to find a longer

704
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
Ethernet cable

705
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:58,240
A little higher than my outlets on the ground

706
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Problem

707
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,640
Once you do that it established you

708
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
Name your network

709
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
If you

710
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,968
Are replacing it make sure you

711
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
Get the exact same SSID

712
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,040
Like me

713
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
End

714
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,672
Your password and then you run around your house just plugging in these other things

715
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
Are the other pods

716
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,256
You know different rooms

717
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
Can the pods get

718
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
Discovered

719
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
Eminem and

720
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
You're done

721
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,240
Yeah and paws are not that expensive

722
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,264
If you bite me.

723
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,824
$69 for a single pod

724
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,384
3 pack is $180

725
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,200
And a six-pack is 300 +

726
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,480
$30

727
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
Probably will want

728
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
Lose people

729
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,808
In a home

730
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,112
Will probably start with the six

731
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,672
Like I have 7in

732
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
House and it's a

733
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
Help me come to my home bring a six pack

734
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
That's my motto

735
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
As a guest I do try

736
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,008
Next week I'll tell you I'll do some actual

737
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
Performance testing

738
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:07,872
Until you already the coverage is good throughout the home

739
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,176
I haven't noticed anything

740
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,480
Weird dead spots or

741
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
Any

742
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,784
Terrible things

743
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,064
So we'll see

744
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,648
After all of that

745
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
We have

746
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,768

Right this very second as we speak and record pebble

751
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,176
I'm just reading out loud now Temple is no longer able to operate as an independent entity

752
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:48,064
We've made a tough decision to shut down the company and no longer manufactured Pebble devices

753
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm going over to the update section of the

754
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
Pebble site

755
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:06,240
Temple devices will continue to work as normal no need changes to the user experience will happen at this time however Pebble Junction

756
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,312
Cellular service quality may be reduced in the future

757
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,152
There's some information on refunds for people of recently ordered as well

758
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,432
Sonu Kaur

759
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,040
Pebble time to Pebble core in Pebble time round Kickstarter Edition

760
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,672
So no further

Refunded from you

763
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:34,656
So here's something because actually this will affect me refunds are automatic payment card the original Kickstarter pledge was placed

764
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,776
Packers must contact their financial institution that issued the

765
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
The card to receive

766
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336

00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808
Where am I

774
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,856
All right so that's the sad

00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,952
It kind of stinks at our first breaking news is actually sadness

776
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,512
That is terrible and it'll be breaking you know tomorrow

777
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Tomorrow when you

778
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
Okay

779
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
Sad

780
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
Into podcast

781
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:14,848
Let's take a break for a message from our sponsor and then we will go to Peter's or you

782
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Who's going to talk about

783
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,408
Changing your business model

784
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
After

785
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,992
The Internet of Things

786
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:28,928
Guys last week I was talking about the August doorbell and I mention their plan to charge users

787
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:32,000
For access to their Clips after certain amount of time

788
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
I told you the wrong time

789
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,608
Find the actual amount of time that you will have

790
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
4

791
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:41,472
Free access to your existing clips from the doorbell is one month

792
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,288
So that's a lot longer than what I thought

793
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,128
And said last week now you know

794
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:54,272
Hey everyone we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast with a message from our sponsor

795
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,856
This week sponsor is Samsung and I have Abi

796
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,160
Who is director of product marketing

797
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,952
With Samsung

798
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,744
Arctic Cloud first off

799
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,280
Tell me what is

800
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
Arctic

801
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,168
Samsung artik Cloud is an open data exchange platform for the iot

802
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,776
It's a relatively new commercial iot Cloud offering from Samsung

803
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
For Enterprises

804
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,920
We provide Enterprises a super-fast way of connecting

805
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:25,248
Siloed devices and enabling Deluxe developer

806
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,552
To deliver new services and application

807
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
How are people use

808
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
ICloud

809
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,928
Take Healthcare and building automation

810
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,072
It has good patients are increasingly generating their own health data using blood pressure monitor

811
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,352
Pulse oximeter

812
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,144
Fitness trackers in salon

813
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,704
These devices were never designed to work together

814
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
What's the site with make it very hard

815
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,544
Florida Healthcare payroll provider

816
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,104
To build a consistent view of the patient's health

817
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,640
Cumberland building

818
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:59,040
It's very hard for the building manager to build a consistent view of how energy is being used

819
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
Throughout the building

820
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,112
When the HVAC system the lighting

821
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,672
System the plug load occupancy sensors

822
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:08,512
The weather feed air quality or don't talk to each other

823
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:12,352
It's breaking down the silos is where Samsung artik Cloud company

824
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,424
Alright and when I actually signed up for Samsung art

825
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:19,264
Which any developer can do I was surprised that the

826
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
This is not a traditional

827
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:25,152
Hey you point your device to this cloud and it takes in the data and does things with it

828
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,200
This is very much a connecting

829
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,992
Can you talk about how

830
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,784
Samsung artik Cloud

831
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
Is different

832
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,856
Then maybe some of the other things

833
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
They're out there

834
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,024
Svcrt cloud is very different from what you see with other iot platforms and services

835
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,048
On the market

836
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,376
Underscore artik cloud is a collection of ready-to-use

837
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:50,240
Apis and sdks that are open that are easy to use that are enterprise-grade

838
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,568
It when we look at other iot Solutions out there

839
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
We see the

840
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,664
We see us as different alarm three key dimensions

841
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,968
The forces we are integrated

842
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,296
We've integrated all the key iot Services you need

843
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,600
Device connectivity data collection

844
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,184
An aggregation device interoperability data access

845
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Security

846
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,512
Into one single platform

847
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,816
And we expose those as API

848
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,864
The second is rebirth in

849
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,240
A number of services around interoperability the ability to connect two different clouds

850
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,848
The ability to manage identity permission data privacy

851
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,152
All that is built in out of the box

852
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,736
The third thing is we've kept Developers front-and-center

853
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,040
When we've designed and built Arctic cloud

854
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:35,808
We've made it

855
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:39,904
Extremely easy for developers to use our API SDK sore tooth

856
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,184
Because we know that

857
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,744
Developers are the ones who will actually use

858
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
Are products

859
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,280
And

860
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,328
Business news services and app

861
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:51,424
That make iot more pervasive more useful

862
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
Abby

863
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,984
How can I find out more

864
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,616
You can learn more and sign up for article out at Arctic. That's a r

865
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,408
Tik. Cloud

866
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,528
You can sign up for free tier you can start connecting devices you can connect

867
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,576
You still existing

868
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,976
Connectors that we have and connect third-party devices you can do a lot in our free tier

869
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:21,376
Hey everyone we are back with the

870
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,704
The Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

871
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
And today we have with us

872
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,312
Peter zornio who is the chief strategy officer for

873
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,360
Automation Solutions at Emerson

874
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,152
Hey Peter how are you doing today

875
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,480
Hi Stacy it's a great pleasure to be with you today

876
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
I am super thrilled

877
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,112
Last time we talked I went to Emerson's

878
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,696
Guys have a nice little demo area here in Austin Texas

879
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,976
And we talked about

880
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,024
All kinds of things but mostly

881
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,864
Turning your products business into a Services business

882
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
On the industrial-size

883
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:59,520
Indeed we did when you walk through a number of demonstrations and we showed you some of the

884
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,848
The application that we are working on it exactly that area

885
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:09,248
I found an awesome to talk to you because you've been doing this a while and I'd love for you just to take the audience really quickly through

886
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,832
Kind of the stages of Industrial Automation because

887
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Automated

888
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
70s

889
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
So

890
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,976
Where where are we and where are we going

891
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,352
Okay Stacy thanks I agree that very much is the case when we look at

892
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,912
Industrial and specifically the

893
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,496
The process industries that we tend to work with Industries like

894
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,056
Chemicals in oil and gas in Pulp

895
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,592
Paper and pharmaceuticals

896
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,200
These are industries that you know have had this idea of sensors

897
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,480
All over the place

898
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,552
Reporting on real-time data that is happening in the process

899
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:49,184
Being fat into computers and then those computers actually taking action to control those processes

900
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,744
That's happened now for probably a good

901
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,536
40 years ever since the first

902
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:58,144
Microcomputer based systems were put in place in the late 60s

903
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,680
Mid-seventies

904
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:04,544
Some of the fundamental principles of people talked about in iot the idea of

905
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:10,432
Sensory feeding real-time data to computers making decisions while that's that's kind of old hat for us

906
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
The new thing

907
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:17,856
Is yeah we've been doing that a long time but we've been doing it very specifically around controlling those processes

908
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,184
And it's historically been gone just on site

909
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,816
You know by instrumentation and Computing resources that are on site you know kind of very much like the

910
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,144
The computer that controls the engine in your car as you drive around

911
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
What's

912
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,984
Certainly do when the whole Industrial internet-of-things

913
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,080
Is a number of things number one the idea of using the internet

914
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:42,176
To take that data and also additional sensor data that you might add

915
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:47,296
And feeding that to anyone in the world or any application anywhere in the world

916
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,136
For analysis and decisions as to what actions to be taken

917
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,256
And then another big changes the tools we have available to us obviously with

918
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:00,352
Things like cloud computing and Big Data statistical analysis and

919
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:07,008
The ability to handle many different types of data other tools and Technology we have to apply to analyze that day didn't come

920
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,312
Come up with answers is dramatically

921
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,872
Differences and it's been 30 years ago

922
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,712
And then perhaps what I think is maybe the biggest change of all

923
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:21,088
Is this idea of the whole new business model of the connected service or the

924
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
Iot service

925
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,928
With that data goes to a third party

926
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,208
Not the customer

927
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,488
For analysis

928
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,768
And you know

929
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:33,632
Overall computational analysis together with an expert looking at the data

930
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,168
A coming back with

931
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:39,008
Actions coming back with this is what you need to do or this is how the problem

932
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
Should be corrected

933
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:43,360
Traditionally our customers have always done that themselves

934
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,408
I mean so that idea of

935
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:49,504
I really turning something that you know they did themselves

936
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,088
Using tools and technology that they purchased from companies like us

937
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,624
Into a service

938
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,976
Something where we actually deliver the outcome to them where we've analyzed the data

939
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:03,072
That's probably the biggest change of all I'd say in the industrial space

940
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,888
Man Peter you are riding my Segway is for me

941
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,680
Because that's my next question

942
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,776
You guys are trying to move into this kind of service aside and I'm

943
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,080
Really curious about what that

944
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
Looks like

945
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
4 Emerson

946
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,920
How you kind of structure

947
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
The shift

948
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
From product to service

949
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,016
And then I'd like to talk about

950
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,808
The value that the customer gets in

951
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
What they say

952
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,744
Cure for a company like us that's traditionally been a technology supplier we had service offerings before

953
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,280
The service offerings

954
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,584
Have been ones where we've come out

955
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
To help

956
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,424
Install and startup and configure our equipment

957
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,752
Where we've come out and help to maintain and

958
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,080
Baby continue to provide some lifecycle value out of it

959
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,384
But we've never been the operator

960
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,480
Of the equipment right we always provided the equipment to end users

961
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:57,088
Who did the final operation and use the data coming from it to

962
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
Can make analysis site

963
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:02,720
I used a very simple analogy that you know we're always

964
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:07,072
The guys that you know sold and serviced your lawn mowers for you and

965
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,864
You went out mold your lawn

966
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,168
Now we're lawn mower service

967
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,984
Will tell you hey if you like is a turnkey Manor

968
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,080
Will put this equipment in will take the data will analyze it and will even

969
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:22,176
In some cases take action for you in addition to just providing you

970
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,200
With information

971
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,272
That's a big business model shift

972
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,320
For you know traditionally

973
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,648
Technology or product supplier company like ourselves

974
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,184
Let's break that down a little

975
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,744
So when making this shift

976
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,536
You don't do it all at once

977
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,584
Crossroad whole portfolio

978
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:40,864
How do you

979
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,144
Target and start

980
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
A process like

981
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,240
One of the first things that we have done

982
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,800
Is we tried to identify

983
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:55,199
The applications that we know will for sure deliver business value to our customers and we've had a

984
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,271
A very big focus on making sure as we talked about

985
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:02,367
Industrial internet-of-things that we always start the conversation from

986
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:06,463
Here's what's in it for you Mr customer from a business value perspective

987
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,839
And we've also made sure to look at areas where we think customers will be comfortable

988
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:17,215
With this idea of about sourcing the function is someone like ourselves

989
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,751
So what does that mean

990
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,031
What are some of the criteria

991
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,567
Okay well number one

992
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,127
Because we're going to be asking too

993
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,431
Do collect data from their sites

994
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,247
And have it looked at by our people

995
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
Well

996
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:36,415
Most of our customers are understandably has a big concern around their intellectual property what that data might be

997
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:42,303
Medium from a privacy and intellectual property point-of-view so we start by looking at applications where we think

998
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,839
The data itself

999
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,423
Is dated at the Comfort that the customers are comfortable

1000
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,471
Having a third party

1001
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:53,311
Owner having it not all about having a 3rd party look at it analyzed

1002
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
Okay

1003
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,871
So not the secret formula

1004
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,199
It's not the secret formula exactly next

1005
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,271
We look for areas that we have

1006
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,063
Great domain expertise in

1007
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,391
Because I'm a big believer when you look at

1008
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,695
Industrial internet-of-things when you look at

1009
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,719
Just

1010
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,279
You know operation Improvement in general

1011
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
Really it's

1012
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,839
All about

1013
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,119
Domain expertise

1014
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,911
Either in the form of

1015
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
Experts

1016
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:25,311
Encapsulated domain expertise in the form of algorithms or software

1017
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:29,919
Or learn to Domaine expertise that you got by running big-data stuff to

1018
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
Define

1019
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,967
You know correlations

1020
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,503
At the end of the day

1021
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,783
This is just

1022
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,087
Yet another deployment model

1023
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,623
For how you

1024
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
Applying and deliver

1025
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
Domain expertise

1026
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,535
2 solving a problem and improving operational performance

1027
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,351
And I think that's true when you look at

1028
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,631
You know other

1029
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,911
Iot

1030
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:55,007
Areas as well I mean if you look at the medical field right you know when

1031
00:43:55,263 --> 00:44:00,383
If you have a Fitbit and your got all this great date of being collected about your personal hell

1032
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:05,759
Who would you like to have at the other end of that Fitbit while you'd like to have the world's leading expert on

1033
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,087
You know Cardiology your you know performance

1034
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,903
Exercising performance or whatever it may be

1035
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
So

1036
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,743
Customers are going to trust

1037
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:20,095
Someone who they believe has great domain expertise in an area

1038
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,631
For this Outsource

1039
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,167
Service kind of model

1040
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,263
So we will get areas where we have that domain expertise can we go to Costco

1041
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,591
Okay so you guys are looking for when you

1042
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,407
Service is a good business

1043
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
Your customer

1044
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,551
And something that you guys know more about than any

1045
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,111
So now here gets the fun part

1046
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,647
Pick something

1047
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,463
The customer seems like they might go for something like this

1048
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,255
Easier so hopefully

1049
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:52,863
And now how do you implement something like this because

1050
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,935
You got to think about contracts like how do you contract

1051
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,239
When you're selling a service versus a product

1052
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,287
In at the lifetime of this product

1053
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,823
What it entails how you

1054
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,591
Renegotiate

1055
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,407
What are some of those considerations

1056
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,199
So that permeates

1057
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,015
Just about every aspect of how we do our business

1058
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,063
It starts from selling

1059
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,391
Okay so again if you're a traditional

1060
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,719
Product or technology sales kind of organization

1061
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,279
You know you kind of live by the

1062
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,863
Project or the demand that a customer has created

1063
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:28,959
And you go in and you try to differentiate your technology or product

1064
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,495
Compared to the other guys

1065
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,263
Here

1066
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,311
It's more of a demand creation model

1067
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,151
You have to go to a customer and be able to sell them

1068
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:41,247
On the business case in the value of of what you're providing

1069
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,551
You have to in some cases

1070
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:49,183
Be willing to move to morva outcome-based Performance contract do you have to

1071
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,511
Not just say hey I'm going to show you a product but actually be willing

1072
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,839
To stand behind what the results for the outcome may be

1073
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,143
Of the particular service that you're delivering

1074
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,983
You get into lots of aspects around

1075
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,519
The data itself

1076
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,335
Where the data is stored is the data connected to

1077
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,639
Securely security of course has a big D

1078
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:12,223
Concern sometimes what we've done in that particular area

1079
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,295
Is we've partnered with Microsoft because

1080
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
You know

1081
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:21,439
Data storage and rules around who owns data vary tremendously across the globe

1082
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:26,815
There has been a lot of focus on that just brought from cloud computing overall so we'd rather just

1083
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351
Partner with somebody

1084
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:32,959
Who can address at least that aspect of it very directly and has a lot of experience in that

1085
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,567
So generally where we land there is the data always belongs to the customer

1086
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,359
But any knowledge

1087
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:42,687
That we gain from working with that data

1088
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,271
That knowledge that application if you will belongs to us

1089
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:50,623
You have to dress contractually what you're going to do if the customer

1090
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:57,023
Is done with the service and you know wants to cancel it for whatever reason and says hey I want to have all my data back

1091
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:02,911
You have to agree who in your organization is going to have access to that data and for what purposes are going to have it

1092
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,447
Let's talk about pricing

1093
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,727
Because this is a big

1094
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,055
Issue I mean going from selling a physical product

1095
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,359
Presumably you sell once

1096
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,919
To selling a recurring Revenue stream

1097
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,735
Recurring service not only is it a different type of sales cycle

1098
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,527
But it's also a different way of

1099
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:19,807
Accounting for it

1100
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,575
Pricing app

1101
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111
So how do you guys

1102
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,415
How did you think about pricing

1103
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,207
When you were sitting price

1104
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,255
So you

1105
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:33,631
Generally always want to work from the value delivered back so you want to look at

1106
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,191
What would this particular service

1107
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,263
Do for a customer what would it cost them

1108
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,079
If they didn't have it what are you saving them

1109
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:42,847
If they

1110
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,871
Didn't have it

1111
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,663
What do you potentially

1112
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:48,991
What kind of down time or maintenance

1113
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,831
Expanse would they have to be spending themselves if they didn't have this service

1114
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,855
And then work

1115
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,135
Into

1116
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,975
You know what a good price would be that looks like it's an equitable sharing

1117
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,559
Are the benefits that you're delivering to the customer and as you can imagine

1118
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,375
There's always a lot of back and forth with a customer on

1119
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,191
Assumptions you're making about what might happen

1120
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,751
Versus assumptions that they might have about what

1121
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,031
What happened with or without

1122
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:12,799
How to service

1123
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,895
So right now you guys are not selling like you are not having to deal with

1124
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,431
Like I sell you a valve

1125
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,991
As part of a service without actually

1126
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,783
Selling someone the physical valve

1127
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,575
What we are

1128
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,647
So we are dealing in some cases where

1129
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:34,047
We sell just the service and Princeton star steam trap monitoring service is a good example of that

1130
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,863
So we're not in the steam trap

1131
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,143
Business per se

1132
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,727
But we know a lot about steam traps because we

1133
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,519
Make specific sensors

1134
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,567
That go on steam traps

1135
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,359
And have built-in

1136
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,431
Algorithms built-in analytics inside of them

1137
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:56,831
That are capable of identifying the acoustic signature that tells you what's happening with that particular string trap

1138
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,439
So in that case we actually go out and we sell a specific service

1139
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:05,023
Where we would go in and put the sensors on your steam traps

1140
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,583
Bring them back to our

1141
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,887
Pervasive sensing Center where we

1142
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,935
Analyze what's going on

1143
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,471
And then we

1144
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:19,871
Tell you which Team traps are failed are likely to fail and which ones to go out and do work on or we can even go and do a

1145
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
Good for you

1146
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:24,735
Are cell so there's an example where we actually are selling

1147
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,527
Just the service

1148
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,575
On equipment that

1149
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,855
We don't manufacture

1150
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,647
And in that case

1151
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:35,743
Talking about you know transforming from selling products to selling services

1152
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,815
That's an interesting financial application for

1153
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
Just because

1154
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,167
There we may go in and install all the equipment to run that service

1155
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:49,311
Well that's Capital Equipment that you know we're going to carry on our books for a prescribed length

1156
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,615
The charm of that of that sales contract

1157
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:55,711
And that's a very different kind of financial business model for us where were

1158
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:59,039
You know Manufacturing Company we're used to looking at things like

1159
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:04,671
Cost of goods sold and inventory and include things like that we try to keep our capital costlow

1160
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,975
Here's a case where in order to get a

1161
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,791
A recurring annuity kind of service

1162
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,607
We're actually going to have to take on some additional

1163
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,935
Capital that we hold on our books in order to

1164
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,727
Enable Unity service

1165
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,031
And what's interesting here

1166
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Is

1167
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:25,151
This isn't a crazy model that got if I think about cloud computing right now

1168
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
You know

1169
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,991
Basically Amazon took all the capital expenditures and

1170
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,271
Google and Microsoft

1171
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,551
To turn

1172
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,855
Computing power into objects for

1173
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,695
Now if I take this though to Industrial manufacturer

1174
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,511
That doesn't feel

1175
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:44,863
A sensor or a valve is in a fungible resource like

1176
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,143
Computer is

1177
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,959
Basically a virtualized server

1178
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:52,799
So that gets into some kind of just basic economics of

1179
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,591
Can we see

1180
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,407
Hey can you guys financially do this

1181
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,687
For everything

1182
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,711
For what things I don't

1183
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:00,991
And then

1184
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,319
Can this really have the type of impact that like cloud computing

1185
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,975
Yeah I think that's a great analogy I think what's interesting when you think about cloud computing also

1186
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,023
Is that those companies

1187
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:17,375
Truck capability you know Computing horsepower

1188
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:22,751
But they were not the providers of right other companies were the providers of that at the time

1189
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,287
You know whether it was

1190
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:28,127
Is Dell or HP or whoever it was that was in the server business right

1191
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,711
But then they became the one that was the service provider of it

1192
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
Okay

1193
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,759
Nnr case

1194
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:37,343
You know where they the Capital Equipment provider it's not

1195
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,647
Possible just as you said that's a great

1196
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
Distinction

1197
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:45,279
To relocate that right that valve that steam trap that whatever piece of process

1198
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
Office equipment

1199
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,095
Have to be physically there

1200
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,119
At the plant

1201
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,655
But the

1202
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:54,751
Uptime of it and they making sure that it's available on demand

1203
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,519
Perform

1204
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,567
The job that is supposed to perform

1205
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,943
You know that's the service that we would be offering going forward and extended to it

1206
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,991
Ultimate end

1207
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
You could see it

1208
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:10,623
Yes being turned into something like what we never even sell you a valve in the first place

1209
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:16,511
We saw you valve uptime right course that's the example that's used a lot with like aircraft engine

1210
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,327
It's right that you moved from buying an aircraft engine

1211
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,655
Do you move it you move to stress by the hour or whatever maybe

1212
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,423
Recall

1213
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,263
I don't see that happening with with everything because

1214
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
You know

1215
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,895
Not every capital expenditure is a

1216
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,967
Is is giant hand in marriage that sort of I think

1217
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,271
Model being built around it

1218
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,807
But for sure

1219
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:45,439
The idea that the maintenance of the uptime and the availability of that of that asset being

1220
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,743
Being there when it's called upon

1221
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,815
I can see a lot of things moving that model

1222
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,631
Cuz it really boils down to

1223
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,935
What are the things that the

1224
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:58,239
End-users the manufacturers

1225
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:01,311
Want to spend their precious time and resources

1226
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
On

1227
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,639
Keeping going and where do they View

1228
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:08,223
Are there domain expertise and what are they better at

1229
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,783
Let's get into the concept of security

1230
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,599
Because we talked about this a lot on the show

1231
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,415
A lot of the most recent discussion is been around

1232
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,463
Consumer and smart home and

1233
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,767
Mirai botnet and all those kind of fun things

1234
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:24,607
But it is kind of a crazy place to think about

1235
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,399
Bad security practices

1236
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,959
So I would love to get a sense from you

1237
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
How your customers are

1238
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
This

1239
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:37,151
First of all they absolutely Dulce security as a very important thing we've run a number of

1240
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,967
Daddies are just questionnaires with our customers

1241
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:43,807
As well as looked at a number of ones that other people done the industrial space

1242
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,647
And you know what usually number 1 and number 2 and

1243
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,719
Switches in order sometime around Industrial iot

1244
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,023
Is what's the business case

1245
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,071
And then the other one is always security

1246
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,887
Obviously in the industrial space

1247
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,679
It doesn't help

1248
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:03,519
The term iot is used broadly

1249
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,615
Whether we're talking about industrial iot or home iot

1250
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,175
Or iot in cities or

1251
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:14,015
You know smart instrumented people it's all called iot

1252
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,807
And then they read in the news

1253
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:19,135
Statue at A candle wiped out

1254
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:23,231
The internet on the eastern half of the United States cuz

1255
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:28,095
Your internet enabled Barbie doll and home thermostat

1256
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:31,167
You know had very poor Security in the first place

1257
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
So that

1258
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:37,311
Sort of Cassidy a shadow over into the industrial space

1259
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:40,639
But in reality what happens in the industrial space

1260
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,687
Is you are dealing

1261
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:48,831
With very professional it organizations that have been working in the security area

1262
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,975
Since computers have been around and certainly with a greater emphasis in the last 10 or 15 years

1263
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,511
There's no way

1264
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,047
They're going to put in

1265
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:02,399
Iot infrastructures and iot connected devices

1266
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:05,983
Without going through every aspect of what the

1267
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,775
Security is an insuring

1268
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,567
That the security is

1269
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:13,919
Up to Snuff it is what it needs to be they are very highly concerned about that

1270
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,199
Okay and in fact

1271
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:21,855
When you look at the stuff that we provide you know to enable iot like RR wireless sensor for

1272
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,623
Polio

1273
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,951
The networks that we design our design with

1274
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,767
High levels of encryption built in from day one

1275
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,583
Key management and you can't even turn it off

1276
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,375
So you couldn't even get into

1277
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:36,959
Kind of the scenario that we see in the consumer iot world

1278
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,495
It's all right

1279
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:41,055
Will Peter thank you so much I feel

1280
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:44,383
