Who every two years does an iot landscape

21
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152
Map and blog

22
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,944
Post it is incredibly Epic

23
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,248
He distills all of that down

24
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,272
1 in an interview

25
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,416
Is the Memory Maker of iot

26
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,720
And this is not a 500 swiper

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,792
It is pretty long but it's not five

28
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,584
The first

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
Let's go to a message from

30
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
Our sponsor

31
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,960
This week sponsor is CBT Nuggets

32
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,264
How does the iot change the way we do business

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,664
For many organizations it means a proliferation of devices and tools and every device connected to your network is another

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,064
Potential vulnerability you may think your greatest security threat is malicious hackers but really it's an unsecured Smart Watch worn by

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,464
But if everyone on your team is trained in security best practices it significantly reduces your chance of

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,864
Data breach for the severity of that bridge CBT Nuggets has been a top training choice for it Professionals for decades

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,264
And now they're making the same high-quality online training solutions for end-user security so your team can read

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
Recognize and stop threats before they make it

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,224
Go to CBT Nuggets. To find out more about how end-user security training can protect your

40
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
Network in the iot

41
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,808
Okay Kevin

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
So much news

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
So they could add some

44
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
The pad but let's kick it off with

45
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,976
News on Apple's homepod

46
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
Which was due out

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
He was an early January

48
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:15,936
Yeah before the end of the year and they deleted come December they announced the delay

49
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,752
If you're listening to this podcast on Thursday

50
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
Comes out you have

51
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:24,128
Friday until Friday to get ready to order your homepod for

52
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:24,896
300

53
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
At 49

54
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,688
Dollars

55
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,736
It will be delivered on February

56
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,320
Correct correct and I have an alarm set to get a

57
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,624
At 3 a.m. eastern time

58
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
I can order one for us

59
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
So we can test it

60
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,512
Obviously won't have it till February 9th at the earliest but

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,632
I was actually thinking about this would I buy this if we weren't going to review this

62
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,424
Am I answer is probably not

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
But obviously we're still going to

64
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
And you're not an

65
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,824
Apple ecosystem user so I'm assuming you would not buy this either

66
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
I'm not even sure we should

67
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Buy it

68
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,224
Chicken spot

69
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
We are going to buy it

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,832
For the show because I think a lot of you guys are listeners really want

71
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,392
To understand what this products about and I totally get

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
So we're doing it

73
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,048
I will say looking at the features it really does not seem like a smart home

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
At all

75
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,912
And that is because they were not marketing it primarily as one

76
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,240
And that kind of fits in with apples standard operating for

77
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,032
Procedure what they'll do is they will

78
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,848
Look at the highlights of something and stress those

79
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,432
Like such as it's going to have awesome music and sound quality inn

80
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,736
You can pair two of these and a stereo sound like

81
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,344
Other devices that are used today although that's a feature that's coming later in the year with a soft

82
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,160
It's all about the sound and everything else

83
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
And the Siri

84
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
Part of it

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
Is all about music Control

86
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,096
And oh by the way you can control homekit stuff

87
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
How to I think it's because they just

88
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
Have a

89
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:57,056
A ton of slew of homekit devices out there on the market by comparison a relatively speaking

90
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Other platforms

91
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
NP

92
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
Siri just

93
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,712
Isn't still that good I mean I don't know how else to say it

94
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
Acceptable at best

95
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
It seems so

96
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,136
I because everyone who's following in the footsteps of

97
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,952
Everyone is following in the footsteps of Apple in the developing

98
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,976
App Store

99
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
Right so back

100
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
2008

101
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
To develop

102
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,655
Like their developer programs for

103
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Voice

104
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
Smart Switch

105
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
I just

106
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:32,639
Apples either apples got some magical big plan that we don't see and it sees the market going in a totally

107
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Different direction which

108
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
Maybe but it feels like

109
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:41,599
It's coming out in the smart speaker space with a product that ignores what people seem to be mostly doing

110
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
What smart speaker

111
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,183
Although most people are setting timers and listening to

112
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
So we could be

113
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,631
True true I mean there's a lot of people affect Apple even said they now have 500 million people using Siri through all

114
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,959
All devices and obviously iOS devices through

115
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
Do they count when I ask

116
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Accidentally activate

117
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:08,223
You know I I don't know the details but it would not surprise me to be honest but it is what it is it's just a number so

118
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
Sure people are using Siri but

119
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,159
Are they frustrated by Siri I'd say not an equal number of series or but I had a heck of a lot of them certainly are

120
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,815
I read through Forums on the other products that are out there and then they're like yep I went with Google home or an echo because

121
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,655
Siri just isn't cutting it for me I can do so much more and so on and so forth

122
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,751
So there are some unsatisfied series with out there in that 500 million number

123
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
For sure

124
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Will this product

125
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
Sway them

126
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,383
Not on day one I don't think

127
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
Because

128
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,503
There's no major Siri improvements that have been mentioned or expected

129
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,831
My guess is to get this out there focus on the home

130
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
Audio features

131
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
In Italian with Apple

132
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,951
Music subscriptions and so on

133
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,023
And then later at WWDC

134
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,863
Show off some better series Smart's cuz it's just

135
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:02,751
But I actually expected that when this came out or last year's WWDC so I was disappointed in both instances

136
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,799
So I could will be disappointed this

137
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,103
Summer when WWDC happens in

138
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,687
I really don't do much with Siri in terms of smart on

139
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:15,807
And we should not forget that actually the Amazon Echo when it came out as a

140
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,135
One of the weird beta products where you had to get an invite to order it

141
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,463
When that came out in December 2014

142
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999
It didn't have any smart home stuff

143
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,535
I didn't get that until

144
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
March Bible

145
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,911
So and that's actually when I ordered it I did not order it out of the box

146
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,007
Because of that reason once they added the partners and the

147
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,567
Smart home stuff that's when I went all-in

148
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
So you're right

149
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Possible

150
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
It's coming I don't know

151
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
Swedish will be a homekit hub for what it's worth

152
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
So you can remotely access things

153
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Google Now

154
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Multi-room audio

155
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
It does not

156
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
Launch

157
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,487
And it does not have the ability to use other music Services which I actually thought was

158
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
Kind of astonishing

159
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Deckstats app

160
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
I know but

161
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
Even put Google actually

162
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,751
Compared to Amazon Google is very limited in its Music Services

163
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
And again that may be a reason to go to

164
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,847
We'll talk about Google in a

165
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,943
In a bit because we've actually both transitioned to try and use

166
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Local Taco

167
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
Homepod

168
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
We are on the fence

169
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Where can I buy it

170
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
Heaven's going to test it

171
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,415
And then we're going to come back and tell you what we think

172
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
And it's probably just going to be an ongoing segna

173
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,999
As hopefully features are added

174
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,047
So I would say to you guys

175
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
If you're all in an apple

176
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,655
And you got 350 bucks burning a hole in your pocket

177
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,847
If you don't already have like a similar system such as a Sonos or or something else with your bottom speaker

178
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,407
Yeah okay that I see but

179
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
It's like what you already have

180
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,783
I tend to agree with you and that and I say that as a

181
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,111
Person who in a family of four we all use iOS devices

182
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
We have an apple music subscription

183
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Family subscription

184
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
I would still

185
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Be hesitant

186
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
Coyote park

187
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
All right

188
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
Bad news

189
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Layoffs in the

190
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
Samurai

191
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
I didn't realize you're going to make yourself

192
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
All right

193
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
TechCrunch is reporting that Sparrow

194
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Laid off

195
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Dozens of

196
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
People as

197
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,295
It had a bad holiday season and also reported the tile

198
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
Laid off dozens of

199
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
People after a disappointing holiday season

200
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
And

201
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,951
That is unsurprising

202
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,023
Consumer electronics are merciless and the holiday season

203
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
Make a break

204
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
But it is kind of

205
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
It's a sad sign for the consumer

206
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
Iot Market

207
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,239
Get in we're just talked about this with our guests met her

208
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
But later

209
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
Short of it is

210
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
Man

211
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Fisher

212
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
2017 has been brutal

213
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
For consumer

214
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
Hardware iot

215
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
And I don't seek it.

216
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,295
It has I think the companies that are doing

217
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
Better or have a

218
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,903
More brighter future are the ones that are expanding their product line

219
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,743
When I look at something like a tile they make a great product as a Bluetooth tracker

220
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,327
And they tweet the design and then features little bit but

221
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
That's all they make

222
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
Well that's not true

223
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
So they actually

224
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
Have a platform

225
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
They're trying to be a platformer

226
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,799
Capabilities of tile into lots of

227
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,383
Products so they have a deal with an umbrella maker they had a deal with

228
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
Land Rover

229
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,455
They have deals with

230
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Companies

231
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Fix your phone

232
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
So

233
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,391
Okay let me just stop or say about because that

234
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
Well I didn't know about that and that is good

235
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,487
It's still the underlying

236
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,071
Product feature and they're trying together Partners as opposed to

237
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
Creighton work a range of devices

238
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,959
And Gathering Partners is not always easy and especially when it's something that

239
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,287
SS fundamental as Bluetooth tracking when there are

240
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,335
Multiple products that can do this

241
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
Either apps on your phone that can do

242
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
I mean

243
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
That's

244
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,967
Just not an expansion of

245
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Products to me

246
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,039
Well so I think it's actually a smarter

247
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Business

248
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
Kind of Port Hardware

249
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
I just think it does

250
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
Take a lot

251
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
It takes time

252
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
So that makes sense and

253
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,583
On Spiro that what they just were bitten by the fact that

254
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,679
You know if you bought one round bb8 saying he probably didn't need the next version

255
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
And they basically

256
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
Trying to shift its focus from

257
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
Education

258
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,103
Which is where they kind of started

259
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:29,503
Out a little bit so we'll see I mean it's possible that Sphero is a decent company but it's probably never going to be that big

260
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
Maybe I could spot by another

261
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Toy company

262
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
Speaking of

263
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
Consumer iot

264
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
Ring is raising money

265
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,559
Evaluation of almost 1 billion dollars according to the information

266
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,863
This is a story I too was chasing

267
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
They just snack

268
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
Snack before I could

269
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Fully confer

270
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
Is it good publication I trust him

271
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
I've heard the Same Rivers

272
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
I am

273
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
By this news

274
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
I cannot fathom

275
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
The ring would be worth

276
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
Billion dollars

277
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
They sell

278
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
Granite they've done what you said

279
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
They've expanded their product line

280
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
But with her

281
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,719
Their lawsuit with ADT which I have also heard

282
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,023
Is close to or has reached a set

283
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,071
It doesn't make sense to me

284
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
If it would be worth that much

285
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,399
I just don't see it

286
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,007
Well I tend to agree with you when I just look at the numbers but then when I step back

287
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
I can like what was

288
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
Net worth

289
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,615
When they only had a couple products

290
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,687
Nest was in a fluffy exciting time back in

291
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,503
In 2014 and they had Tony fadell who by the way just moved

292
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
France

293
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,903
Okay yeah he's got offices now and some French Hardware

294
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
Startup

295
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,999
Oh I can't think of the French word for cool

296
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Okay

297
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
True. Very true

298
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
I don't I'm not saying I see

299
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,471
Ring is worth a billion dollars it's not for me to say anyway cuz I'm not a financial analyst

300
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
I sort of get it

301
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,615
I mean the smart home and iot space is all you see is

302
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Reports of

303
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
X billion devices

304
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,479
The next five years and summer

305
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
I'm really from a consumer standpoint

306
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
At the very beginning of this Market

307
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,879
So you're going to have inflated value so I'm not saying again

308
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
They're worth a billion but I can see

309
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Why people think they might be

310
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,767
I feel like

311
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
If I look at

312
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
The stuff in it

313
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
And I'm talk to some of their

314
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Pliers

315
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
I don't think they're making much margin

316
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
Countertop corbels

317
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
They still have

318
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:31,871
It's a relatively High bomb but they also pay licensing fees for all of their video processing

319
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,919
So I look at that and I'm like

320
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
That could be

321
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
And

322
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
The security products

323
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
Is actually really calm

324
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
Telling but it's not on the market

325
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
And meanwhile dark

326
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
Senators are

327
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
Going all out to

328
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
Black security available

329
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
Michelle

330
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,279
Briefly talk about that because Comcast

331
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
Actually reported

332
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
Their earnings on

333
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Wednesday 12

334
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,935
And they now have one point

335
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
13 billion

336
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
Home automation and Security customer

337
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
Merced CS

338
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
They basically made

339
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
Home automation

340
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
Available to 15 million

341
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
After customers with

342
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
Their fanciest

343
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Right

344
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
So I look at that I'm like

345
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,111
The holy cow 4% of Comcast

346
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
Broadband subscribe

347
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
Drivers have made the choice

348
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
Call Beth and said I want this

349
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
Right and I'm willing to pay for it

350
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,071
And I'm willing to pay for it and now

351
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
Everyone can have it

352
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
And call up in

353
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
It's on like

354
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
They don't have to call

355
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
I should have to do

356
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
I'm sure they do with God

357
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
That's all I'm going to say

358
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
I know you have strong feel

359
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:42,271
So so I look at that and then alarm.com has about 5 million

360
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:49,439
ATT is getting actually more active with SmartThings and they've got 7.2 million business and

361
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Presidential Kush

362
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
That's a little different

363
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
Maybe ring is

364
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,215
This is just me off the top of my head maybe ring is positioning itself to be purchased by another security company

365
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
Yes they have their own security products coming out

366
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
They do have the doorbells

367
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
They have

368
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,895
It just announced at CES some new outdoor

369
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,735
Lights as a result of purchasing mr. beams

370
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,039
I don't recall how much they paid for mr. Bean's butt

371
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,343
They're getting to outdoor LED lighting

372
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,671
Maybe they're just set themselves up to be to be blunt I don't know

373
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
I would not need none of the security cam

374
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
Buy them at

375
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,351
We're just

376
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
Let's talk

377
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Briefly

378
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
It's because I

379
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
Transitioned in the last week to using

380
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
My Google home

381
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
And a Google mini

382
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
Tell Google home what downstairs in my

383
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
Open plan living dining

384
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
Kitchen area

385
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
And then a Google mini

386
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
It is in my bedroom

387
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
I'm trying to force my

388
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
They're like

389
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Metal

390
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
Tell me this

391
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Come up with

392
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,583
So you sound flummoxed

393
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,959
It's a frustrating experience in part just because now I have to touch all of these things that

394
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
Previously worked

395
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Work cell

396
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
Keeping that in mind

397
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
I will say first off

398
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,407
Google has some awesome features like the ability to add

399
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
Really easily

400
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
Things to my Google Calendar

401
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
The challenges I can't use the Google home with my

402
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Professional

403
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Google

404
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Accounts

405
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,927
Right not a Google Apps account that is correct and that is just

406
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
Cos Amino end of

407
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Pain

408
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
Because I add things but it goes to the

409
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,327
Open calendar and I share the calendars but

410
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,911
I apparently can't share them both ways I'm experiencing some

411
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Trouble

412
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:41,567
This has been a long-term challenge for Google and a lot of people validly complain about it

413
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,151
And I keep coming back to the fact that from a business standpoint

414
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,455
People use Google Apps own their data

415
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
So Google

416
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Doesn't

417
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,135
Put a lot of functionality smart functionality in those accounts it doesn't work with them because

418
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
You know

419
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
It's different on the consumers

420
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
I would actually give Google

421
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,583
Cuz I think there's a huge value-add to being able to ask

422
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,631
Cuz right now if I ask Google what's on my

423
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
My calendar for the day

424
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,447
It doesn't cuz most of my

425
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Appointments are on my

426
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Apps

427
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
And so

428
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
It's like

429
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
You don't have anything today

430
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
Yes madam

431
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
Can tie into my Google

432
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
And this is

433
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
I'm like

434
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,855
NN people are probably people who

435
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,903
Use it for work I probably like this is awesome

436
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,511
But they're giving up something that they said they never want to give up on that is giving a work date at 2

437
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,351
Right but I'm okay and I don't know if we get it

438
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:43,007
Yeah but I have to make some major policy changes terms of service and so on I don't know that all the people who are try or you

439
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,079
Using say a Amazon Echo with a work Google account

440
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:51,455
Understand that the very thing they said they never wanted to do they're actually doing I don't think they're putting two and two together

441
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
But hopefully now they

442
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Cuz you adjust

443
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Okay

444
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
The other thing that is driving me bonkers

445
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Outside the musical

446
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Is

447
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
The Google shortcut

448
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
Some of my work

449
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,583
Some of mine

450
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,399
But Lord I cannot tell

451
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
Why they don't

452
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
And this is driving me bonkers

453
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
They're also very limited in my experience

454
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,591
They are limited it is also I will say it was frustrating

455
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Like to do my

456
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
Harmony so with my television

457
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,271
When I because Harmony is not a device that

458
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
You can add from

459
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,855
App you have to verbally say

460
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
Okay g

461
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,415
Add Harmony

462
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
And then it says

463
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,023
Okay I'm showing you a card to link your account

464
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
And then you link

465
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,863
But then when you say you have to then say

466
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,191
Call me to okg ask Harmony to turn on

467
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Yes

468
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
And what's weird

469
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,031
Is then

470
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
Your TV turns on

471
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
And then

472
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
Sometimes

473
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
Completely do voice comes on

474
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
I'm Harmony

475
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,247
How can I help you

476
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,063
So it's funny you mention that to me it's almost like

477
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
Adding a bot

478
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
That's what they've done Nevada. Chatbot for

479
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
Some of these products

480
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:10,047
Like I have the canary and I added finally got the canary linkage to work with Google Assistant

481
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
And it's exact same thing

482
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,703
So when I want to find out who is home or was not home which Canary can do that with his geolocation

483
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,287
I have to say you have to ask G to talk to Canary

484
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,615
And then the different voice because it's a canary bot comes in and says

485
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
What can I help you

486
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
Who is home

487
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,223
And it will tell me who is Homer

488
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
So it's

489
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
It's a freaking point

490
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,135
Because it's not a native integration and it's very I totally read this very first

491
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,951
So that was that and I did turn in the other

492
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,279
Harmony is a good example of this actually because then I created a short

493
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
That's so now I can say Okay g turn on TV

494
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
I can also turn on

495
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Options to SATA

496
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,007
Then you have to make a second

497
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
Turn off TV

498
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
Adventure

499
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Volume

500
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,663
And each time Harmony comes back on even though you

501
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
And talk to you

502
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:02,527
Yes to thoughts on that one I actually don't have that problem only

503
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
Because

504
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,647
My TV is connected to the Nvidia Shield which is an Android TV box

505
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,695
So I can just say Okay g

506
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,999
Turn TV on and it fires up both my

507
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,583
My TV and the shield box because it's actually working through the shield box

508
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,399
And I can do the same thing with turn off and it shuts both of them off

509
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,191
So if you go with an a native

510
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,007
Chromecast capable thing it works well

511
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
And I know that you're not doing that

512
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,591
I'm just pointing out for those who have that

513
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,383
If you have Chrome Cast

514
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Yes

515
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
My other thought on these shortcuts is

516
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
I can't

517
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,343
When do scenes or routines with multiple things happen

518
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
I think so what I did was

519
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,207
I hooked up with has a recent integration I hooked up you know me

520
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
Into Google

521
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,303
And now when I walk into my room which I typically

522
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
Want to chill out

523
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,959
At night time and watch TV or something listen to music I say Haji activate relaxation

524
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
And I set that up and you know me too

525
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
Turn on the light at 50%

526
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,919
It's not you bright and fire up my Sonos with some easy listening music so I tie together things that weigh

527
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
And by the way

528
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
Because we did have someone ask this question

529
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
We're bad people

530
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Coconut

531
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Has a problem

532
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,391
You know me is spelled y o n o m

533
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,183
Augmentin

534
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,767
All of your Googling in the world may not get you there

535
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
But let us know

536
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
So

537
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
Tell me if you can spell me

538
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,191
Roof

539
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,823
Disappointed as one of their labs

540
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Hurts so

541
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Your mileage may vary

542
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
All right

543
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,783
Google Voice match works with Netflix profiles now which would be

544
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,575
Be cool if Google Voice match actually

545
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:49,791
Yeah that's true and then because I'm the only one who talked to anything in my house and my family still is not even on The Voice

546
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
I can only test

547
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,607
I can't really test voice match

548
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
Just throw that out there

549
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,519
But that's handy if it does work for you because we have multiple profiles in Netflix

550
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
If I could get them to use it

551
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,871
You know my daughter could say hey G

552
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,527
Watch whatever it was Grey's Anatomy on Netflix a would pick up where she left off versus where I left off a little I don't watch crazy

553
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
Netflix

554
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
All right and then Kevin you found a smoking hot

555
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
Google home Mini

556
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:23,840
Yes and I just verify before the show that it's still active Google how many was easy to get on sale over the holidays but all those say

557
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,400
Disappear now it's full price pretty much

558
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:31,776
Because you and I are making this move to kind of transition away and test the waters more with Google home

559
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,104
I went and found a Google home Mini 2 pack deals

560
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,688
You got one in charcoal one and chalk you cannot pick the color to get one of each

561
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
For $88

562
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Shipt

563
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,784
Expedited shipping is included

564
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,880
88 bucks no sales tax either unless you live in New Jersey or New York

565
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
Go to B&H

566
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,232
Toto and you can get two Google home minis for 88 bucks

567
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
Which is what I did

568
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,816
I think that delivered yesterday

569
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,888
Call me based on what we're saying you may not get excited about the

570
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
We're still experimenting

571
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
It's possible.

572
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
Even out the Kinks

573
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
All right

574
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
We got some quick news bits

575
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
So

576
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
Trouble in the world of

577
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,176
Low-power wide area

578
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,992
Networks this is from fiercewireless

579
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,784
Cuz they've been following this

580
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
Sigfox

581
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,416
Confirmed earlier this year that it's us Chief is no longer with the

582
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,512
The company and that it didn't reach its network coverage goals for 27

583
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,816
Which feels like bad news

584
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,888
Allen poythress

585
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,704
Who is president of sick-box North America

586
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Is left

587
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
Is Secaucus station to part ways

588
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,312
Which feels like you

589
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
And then

590
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,688
In the story they also talked about John Horn who would left ingenue

591
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,992
Which was another low power wide area Networks

592
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,576
Last spring I haven't heard much at all from ingenue

593
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
Can you

594
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
Since probably 2016

595
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,768
I feel that that's probably

596
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
I would not be excited about

597
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,096
So just to step back on both of these

598
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
Companies that you're mentioning

599
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,472
These are I don't want to leave incorrect made out of these proprietary low power

600
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,752
Their proprietary

601
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,568
Right End to me

602
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,104
At this point in time

603
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,920
You know when they conceived the idea I think it was a great idea

604
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,480
But at this point in time I think they're challenge

605
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
Is obviously

606
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
The more standard

607
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,344
Wireless protocols and implementation

608
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,744
That carriers are starting to pick up on but I don't know if you agree or not I think there's still a role for these kinds of

609
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
They're going to be increasingly pressed between

610
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
Laura

611
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,864
Which is kind of a white area but

612
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
It doesn't have to have

613
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,912
Play Nationwide coverage right

614
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,448
And these private Networks

615
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
People are setting

616
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,776
Using Laura and then also

617
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,336
Nb-iot and Cat

618
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
At 1 a.m.

619
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,408
Networks that the carriers are

620
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,992
Exactly that's the issue I think it is a matter of timing

621
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,272
And more

622
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
Standard

623
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,856
Implementation send anything else but that's just my guess

624
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136
Indeed

625
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
And this is a little bit of

626
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Sad song

627
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,976
Security news but

628
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
Rescue button

629
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
People buy

630
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,096
These are Bluetooth face buttons

631
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:10,496
Women or protesters or anybody who worries about personal safety you can press the button on these and they're supposed to alert

632
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
Someone with like

633
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
Hey I've arrived at the

634
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
This place or it might be like

635
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,896
Attacked help

636
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
And it sends data

637
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,224
From the device to your phone and then the

638
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
The phone sends usually at

639
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,600
So Duo security has done research and they found

640
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,880
But unfortunately

641
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,696
Three major devices we're safe revolar

642
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
And

643
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,792
The roar personal safety system known as

644
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,840
Athena all have some sort of

645
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
Compromised

646
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,448
So the best one is the Athena from

647
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
Roar personal safety

648
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,032
The other two have some issues

649
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,336
On their Bluetooth security so they can be

650
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,616
You could be trapped

651
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
Using Bluetooth

652
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,224
On both of these other devices and they are subject to denial

653
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
Service attack

654
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:59,648
And this is a problem I think the denial-of-service attack is probably not some random guy is going to bug you is probably more for like

655
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,464
Local government using it against protesters but

656
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
The fact that you can be

657
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,144
Tracked via Bluetooth is a problem because this is a kind of device that women who have stalkers often

658
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
Look for

659
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,264
And if you have a stalker it's possible that they will actually just instead use it to track you

660
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,848
The actual problem is trying to solve actually contribute to the

661
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:24,736
Pulling to this in the show notes cuz it's an interesting study is it important

662
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Issue ID

663
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,576
I've never bought one of these but I have considered them

664
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,136
And I have a daughter and I'm like hey you know

665
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,696
It might be nice for her to have just a quick button

666
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
Although

667
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
Probably just forget it

668
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
That is

669
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,680
All our news basically so let's talk about

670
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,472
Kevin has bought a new

671
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:51,872
Yeah you called it a curable before the show which is sorta is but at my first true hearable

672
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
Was purchased

673
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
Just to level set

674
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,016
I have noticed over the past several years that I am having problems

675
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,832
Scaring people in conversation when

676
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,624
There's a lot of background noise multiple

677
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,904
People talking and so on

678
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,488
And I don't think it's an issue when I listen to music more than that because I crank

679
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
Turn the volume up

680
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,328
Seems my TV and pack my family is like

681
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,912
Why is your TV so loud in your office and we're down here we can hear your TV

682
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
It sounds great to me but that's because

683
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,032
I'm obviously starting to experience some hearing challenges

684
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
And

685
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,128
I mean I know that embarrasses some people that I've no issue

686
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
You know admitting to it so I'd rather fix it

687
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
So

688
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,224
What I did was

689
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,784
I actually found a free app

690
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,160
And it's you can get it at for iOS only it's called FedEx Fe and NEX

691
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:40,512
Go to FedEx. IO to hear about it it's an augmented hearing application

692
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,352
It's free it works with Bluetooth headphones and iPhone

693
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:50,496
What does is it basically pipes the sound from an iPhone to your headphones

694
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,312
She put an iPhone next to say the TV

695
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,128
And it captures through the microphone of the phone

696
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,408
All of the audio

697
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:03,040
Comes up to your ears and you can adjust the sound and so on so I can turn the TV down so my family doesn't hear it

698
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:09,440
But I hear it just as loud because it's being Bluetooth fed to my ears it was free and then like Alyssa's not

699
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
Bad but I would have to use the

700
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:17,376
The phone has the microphone all the time so it's not ideal as a long-term solution for me

701
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,936
Purchased iqbuds witch

702
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,240
Are basically Bluetooth wireless

703
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
Earbuds

704
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,032
Just like the airpod

705
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,616
How to put one in each ear but they also have two microphones

706
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
In each

707
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
Earbud

708
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,712
And that will amplify sounds you can

709
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:35,552
Get rid of some noise as noise suppression which is fully configurable

710
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
There a difference

711
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,136
Cenarios wrecking Sam at home I'm in a meeting I'm in a

712
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:39,904
Cara

713
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
Plane

714
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,208
You can set different environments

715
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
And

716
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,024
Maybe they look a little goofy to me

717
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,840
But I'm certainly not ready for a hearing aid yet

718
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,704
They're working really well they're not cheap they're a lot cheaper than during any other $299

719
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,984
Battery life is not

720
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
Mary exceptionalists

721
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,664
Literally four hours if you're going to listen to music and hear the outside world with eight hours if you just want to hear and amplify

722
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
Sound for conversation

723
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,552
In such a little wireless charging case airpods 2

724
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:12,672
Overall I'm pretty happy with them they have great conversations in my family to test them

725
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,208
Pictures of much better

726
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:19,584
I could turn my TV down in my office late at night and still hear the sound really really loud if I want

727
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,936
So you know you've mentioned parables in the past they sit and Ivory

728
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,240
It's always kind of scoffing at am I let's just silly butt

729
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,520
Now that I need the money

730
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:32,128
What's coughing anymore and this is an interesting experience

731
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:37,760
That's why we don't use video when we do the podcast I be shaking my head like Yoruba

732
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,784
That's just silly

733
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,624
What I bought Heroes

734
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,928
All right and then you've got another

735
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Project

736
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,304
Yeah you want make a quick

737
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:54,912
I always have a project and I can probably talk for 2 hours on this. Don't worry

738
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,264
Yes I will yes I will and I will share code and so on and so forth

739
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:03,360
So I have long said I want my smart home to be smarter

740
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,944
It has so much data but I can't get it that day though

741
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,832
I can't make things talk to each other unless the device makers make things talk to each other not frustrate as all heck

742
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,648
So as a programming newbie

743
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:21,024
I decided to start tackling some of these personal challenges and my smart home to get more value

744
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
Of the date of its being

745
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:27,936
In this particular instance I'm not capturing data from the home I'm having my home intelligently

746
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,728
Notify me with Ambien notify

747
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
Vacations

748
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,568
Things that are happening in the world that I care about

749
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
In particular

750
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
I have

751
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,176
Tied into the API

752
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:42,272
Of a crypto coin exchange I used to buy and trade coins

753
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:46,112
I want to know when I wake up or anytime of the day without going out

754
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,160
Route to an app or the Weber thanks

755
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,488
How am I doing on my coins making money today or they losing money

756
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,024
So I tied into the

757
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,352
API for binance which is the exchange of values

758
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:00,192
And I also tied into the API for lifx bulbs

759
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:05,824
Which are homekit compatible bulbs similar to Philips Hue in that you can change the color of them

760
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
And so on so forth

761
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
What I did was

762
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:12,480
Every two minutes I have a python if I created that uses an API to get

763
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
The value of

764
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,320
Acrylic point and then it takes that data

765
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:22,464
And conditionally changes the light bulb color from green to red I mean the plus a negative

766
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,744
And it

767
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,048
Take the percentage gain or loss

768
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,352
And be that as a brightness

769
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,144
Parameter to the lifx bulb

770
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,496
So if I wake up and I've got a bright green light in my office I know

771
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,288
I had a good night in the crypto coin invest

772
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,824
I don't want to see red obviously

773
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,872
Right now I'm seeing a little bit of red

774
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
As we speak

775
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
Not good but

776
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,736
It's really interesting to me to

777
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,528
Have my home

778
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,808
Notify me of

779
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
External

780
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,880
Data such as that like I care about

781
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,696
And people may not care about crypto coins you could have caused anything

782
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,976
You could make a quick

783
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
Weather

784
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,560
App that scans for the actual temperature outside and

785
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,096
Lights the bulb 2

786
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,424
A certain color and so much there's a lot of implementation so you could do

787
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
So I'm going to say I've been doing this for

788
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
4 years using

789
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,152
I've told you for years from

790
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,992
Used it to show like I actually used to have a light that lit up in my

791
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,272
My office if

792
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,320
Stock that I followed on Yahoo

793
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,368
Finance was moving more than

794
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
5%

795
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
Which

796
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
It's awesome

797
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,376
If you are and you should follow Kevin cuz he can probably get more granular

798
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,168
Left and there's less of latency

799
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,496
But if you're not you can do a similar thing

800
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,616
Absolutely absolutely

801
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,664
No no no you're hungry

802
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
Can't write because not everybody wants

803
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,224
2 code

804
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
And I

805
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,784
Took this as a to

806
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,576
Factor thing one I want

807
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,624
To get that information with a glance

808
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,184
Batu and also trying to learn to code

809
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
Let me know when

810
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,536
Stops and starts and what not as I get older it's just it's a fun thing for me

811
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,584
So I'd like to even expand this

812
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,376
Yes to having notifications

813
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
From a voice assistant

814
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
That says

815
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
So-and-so is home now

816
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,824
Meaning to my canary has that it tells me in the timeline of events

817
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
I just got home

818
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:20,480
And that data is available in the event logs for an API so I just need to figure that out

819
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:24,576
It's a wide range of applications that you could do any right you don't have a code for it but it's

820
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
It's really

821
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Really a fun experience for me

822
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:32,512
So I will write this out and again you could apply at theoretically to any bit of information or any type of

823
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:36,096
Device that might give you ambien or actual notifications

824
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
It is time for our

825
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,448
Internet of Things podcast

826
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
Listener

827
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,496
Brought you

828
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
Ashley

829
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
Maker of electronic

830
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:50,688
Clocks with slate you can have a brand new electronic lock installed in minutes with just a screwdriver and your own two hands

831
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,736
And they're easy to setup and use

832
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,296
To see what's possible is it schlage.com

833
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
To learn more

834
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
So

835
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,368
Here's this week's

836
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,672
Stacey Kevin

837
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,976
Thank you for the continuous flow of great information

838
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,560
When I bought my home it had a pre-existing home security system

839
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,352
Hardwired window and doors

840
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
Pictures Etc

841
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,936
Play Never activated it for monitoring little security

842
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,520
Do you know of any iot type devices or systems

843
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:21,408
I can tap into this pre-existing Hardware I would love to use the existing sensors to either build my own

844
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,200
Do-it-yourself security system

845
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,736
Or just incorporate them

846
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,760
It's my smartphone

847
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,320
I've been looking your system such as SimpliSafe

848
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:34,720
Sensors from Elgato

849
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
Sensors

850
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:40,352
Windows and doors right next to the listing sensors that are already hard-wired in

851
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,656
Thank you for anybody she might have

852
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
Okay we have

853
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
An easy solution for you

854
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:53,152
And it's actually very recent solution so you should enjoy this I actually have tested this device out I need to write a

855
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,200
But connected

856
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,992
That is connected with a k

857
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,784
And it's connected. IO

858
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:03,136
Cells and they will ship in March a connected alarm pad

859
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,928
That is basically

860
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,976
Like a little Arduino that

861
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,256
Hooks into your

862
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,608
Existing alarm system and you wire the individual wires

863
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,632
To the

864
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
Arduino and

865
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:18,240
Poop it converts those Wyatt signals into digital signals

866
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
SmartThings

867
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,080
When it arrives you're going to be like what the what

868
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,384
Because I'm basically bored

869
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,176
But if you can install a thermostat

870
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,200
You can install this

871
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,224
And

872
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,040
Once you have installed you install SmartThings

873
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,600
And you tie it to that and then you have

874
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,648
The ability using SmartThings to

875
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,440
You control this if you don't have summer things

876
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,464
I don't think you can

877
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,536
Right right so you can look a little daunting if you

878
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,816
He purchases thing in

879
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,864
Like you said to take out the box and go what the what

880
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,704
You were literally getting a small microprocessor board

881
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
And

882
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
You got a

883
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,800
Isomers instructions that explain what

884
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,384
Wires may go to what IO ports and pins on this thing

885
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,688
But you're literally bridging digital

886
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
In a wireless and wired with us

887
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,528
That's exactly what I think somebody

888
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,088
Cool as a wire system wired sensors

889
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
Would want to

890
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Cortical modernized

891
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:11,744
It certainly is a lot cheaper than ripping everything out and replacing all your sensors because it

892
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,024
Depending on how many

893
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,608
Sensors that you have makeup but I probably say sensors

894
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,168
They range from sickness zones to 24 zones

895
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,776
And the prices anywhere from Etsy $675

896
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,104
In 24 zones would be up to $165 if you have

897
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,736
24 less sensors or up to 20% and 165 bucks is a lot cheaper than replacing All Those sensors

898
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,040
And if it looks truly intimidating

899
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:39,136
I'm a magic video installs

900
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
So

901
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,952
Video insults video instructions

902
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,536
So they were almost 1800 backers of this

903
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
Kickstarter and

904
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:52,192
A percentage of those people are going to share their experiences that God chose how they did it what work what did

905
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,520
These type of devices usually have a fanbase for a crowd that is

906
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,848
More than willing to share information so that everybody benefits

907
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,944
Yes and remember you will have to buy a SmartThings Hub but I think those are

908
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,992
Or somewhere between fifty and a hundred bucks

909
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,528
Depending on sales and

910
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,576
They're very expensive

911
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,880
Relatively speaking yes

912
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
That is our advice

913
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
To you

914
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,232
If you have an iot

915
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,280
Question feel free to call us

916
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,304
The Highline at

917
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
512

918
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
6 to 3

919
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,400
742 4

920
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,960
And maybe we'll play on the air and

921
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,008
We probably will

922
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
Cuz we're so nice

923
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,080
Hats

924
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,360
That's a lot of stuff

925
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,688
From Kevin and I so stay tuned for a message from our sponsor and

926
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
Our Guest Matt Turk

927
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,016
Who is going to explain

928
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,320
What happened last year and what will happen

929
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344
Next year

930
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,368
Brother this year

931
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,672
Can The Internet of Things

932
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:51,072
Hey rewind we are taking a break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor

933
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,864
Weather is point Central

934
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,912
And I have Sean Miller president

935
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
A poinsettia

936
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,704
Scared to talk to her

937
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,496
Let's kick it off with

938
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Ascent

939
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
Point Center

940
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
What is it

941
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,360
Pointcentral is a leading

942
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,944
Provider of home automation technology to short and long-term

943
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,712
Property manager

944
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,760
What we've done is turn

945
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:15,904
Home automation Tech from Individual gadgets that a homeowner made deploying their individual home into an Enterprise

946
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,696
Sweet the property managers do

947
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,512
Deploy software and Hardware costs all the homes they manage

948
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,840
They both improve their operational efficiency and Delight the resident

949
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,144
Okay so you probably have a good sense of

950
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,168
What's happening

951
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,448
The Smart Home

952
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
What's new

953
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,008
Coming off the heels of Cs

954
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,800
One of the big trends that

955
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,848
Seems to be continuing to grow with voice

956
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:41,248
We're really excited about voicemail voice has come a long way in three years to feel like it's in the research get the same approximate penetration

957
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,296
Home automation in that time

958
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,576
And it really helps

959
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:50,976
Residents who are for the first time stepping into a smart home in arcade paid the way for them interact that home and away they find

960
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Comfortable

961
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,840
Boise and credited with doing away with a lot of the standards drama around the smart

962
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:56,864
For consumers

963
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,168
But if someone is actually enabling Smart Home

964
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,448
Spore customer

965
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
You still have to

966
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
Think about that

967
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,776
What are some of the technology

968
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,872
When you look at the space out there today they're Z-Wave zigbee

969
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
Thread

970
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,200
Bluetooth Wi-Fi we rely on

971
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:16,064
Z-Wave for the predominant amount of our device communication because we can encrypt it

972
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,624
And being in a mesh Network that allows us to

973
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
To make sure the communication is

974
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,208
Reliable and also very low power

975
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
Turn Wii U

976
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,768
A private

977
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Encrypted

978
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,560
Cellular line

979
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,608
You get the data

980
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,912
Security Torx

981
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:34,752
Purse I think you'll see a lot of the conversations around

982
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,776
What's the right

983
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,800
Protocol

984
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
Settle down probably two winners

985
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:44,736
This year really excited about outside of that was this other thread that was prevalent in CS with this idea

986
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,760
Home start to become smart

987
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,552
Write that kind of convenience

988
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,904
Savings of people may see as you can look at a mass adopter really needs to

989
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
Beacon proact

990
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,000
I'm at something Point Central really excited about and then

991
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,584
With a company alarm.com if you put a lot of resources into

992
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
What is that look

993
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,168
1 servers were rolling out

994
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,472
This year is an actual HVAC

995
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
Predictive notification

996
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:11,616
Conservice so collectively with our parent company alarm.com we have over 5 million homes on her sister

997
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,152
Look across

998
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
AutoZone jumper

999
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Performing

1000
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,040
Dive into a specific area and notice an average so for example

1001
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:23,904
We may see in Phoenix in summer time that it takes 2 hours for home decor for degree

1002
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,464
Them something when we noticed one home

1003
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,512
Take 6 hours to cool those same

1004
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:32,096
2 degrees we can driving notification to the property manager that says hey

1005
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,632
There's something going on

1006
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,936
But you now have the option to go take care of

1007
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,496
This problem before the resident is upset

1008
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,264
B

1009
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,544
Allura cosplay

1010
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,872
Because you won't be rushing someone out there and dealing with a big problem

1011
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:49,248
But rather now can go out and deal with the problem proactively when it's a lower-cost and probably just part of making

1012
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,272
Gosh

1013
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,296
I want that now

1014
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,344
Where can I go to find out more about boys

1015
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,952
The best place to learn about us is point central.com

1016
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,448

You have produced

1024
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
It feels wrong to call it a

1025
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,368
It is like an epic time

1026
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,904
Of all of iot

1027
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,976

1028
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256

Let's

1035
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,872
Let's break it down for people who don't want to go

1036
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,176
To the blog post anichart

1037
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,968
What are the top

1038
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,784
Noticed and then that your

1039
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
Yes sir

1040
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,928
Has been a little bit

1041
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,696
Chicago

Principal

1048
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,368
Company failure but I think what I have

1049
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
Beyond

1050
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
There is

1051
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,280
Mystic way of looking at the states which is that

1052
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,560
Thank you very much

1053
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
Berkshire Building

1054
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
Cycle

1055
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,752
CPAC for the last couple of years but

1056
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,663
You're not around cloud computing

1057
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,943
Computing

1058
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,063
Because it's more

1059
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,439
We're going to take him to Olive

1060
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
And more

1061
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,255
So let's kick it off

1062
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
In

1063
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,655
2017 and is continuing

1064
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,215
I think to struggle going into

1065
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
This year

1066
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,799
Holiday layoffs

1067
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,079
Are post-holiday layoffs

1068
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,151
If I

1069
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,199
The head of a consumer iot

1070
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,807
Do I just give up and go home I think this year is about to be about

1071
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,087
Major price pressure

1072
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
China

1073
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,159
So I am curious what your advice to the

1074
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
Send

1075
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,447

Doppler labs

1078
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,055
One's very promising

1079
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,871
Brandon Joseph

1080
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,391
In between

1081
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951

1083
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,767
Number of

1084
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,815
Manufacturers in a row cause

1085
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
China

1086
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,631
By the way

1087
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
China

1088
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:22,751
Companies that are

1089
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,311
Absolutely no longer

1090
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
Western

1091
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:26,847

1092
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,407
Another set of computer at the top of the market

1093
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
Largest

1094
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,551
Companies that we're always

1095
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:41,439
Space but I've already started coming to the stage

1096
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,743
In the Life 2

1097
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,303
I think she looks very particular at 1

1098
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,167
Space with you

1099
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
Voice platforms

1100
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,239
You see that very quickly has become

1101
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,543
Racine Country Club

1102
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:01,407

00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,199
Coming into the state as well

1104
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:10,879
Eaton company

1105
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,671
Excluded

1106
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,975
From decorations

1107
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
Companies

1108
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,095
To be able to play in this

1109
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:33,663
Now

1110
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,687
But yeah

1111
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:38,527
Ultimately what you want to be

1112
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
Buy The Watch Company

1113
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:46,207
We are witnessing Vienna of sage

1114
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,487
Electrical fire

1115
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,255
Yours

1116
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,559
That could perhaps Colby Brenda experiment

1117
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,143
Yorkshire yours then

1118
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
The Hope was running

1119
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,727
1

1120
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,263
Why I didn't connect

1121
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,287
Dumb products

1122
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,847
Smart products

1123
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,407
You could create

1124
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:09,503
Products products that brought so much more value

1125
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:13,599
Rush to buy them

1126
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,879
Much higher prices

1127
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,671
And then the other part was

1128
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,999
That's hardware was finally getting less hard

1129
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,559
Your Hardware was

1130
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,119
But you can go much faster

1131
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,143
Getaway.

1132
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,799
So fast forward to

1133
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
Today

1134
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,103
I think we need

1135
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,407
The end of that phase

1136
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,967
Where

1137
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,783
To posting quite pan out

1138
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,575
Maybe it's because I started out in the

1139
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
Enterprise

1140
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,159
It always struck me as odd

1141
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
Having

1142
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,463
Venture firms investing

1143
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,743
Consumer products

1144
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
That were

1145
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,815
Hardware-based and had fundamentally

1146
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
So

1147
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,167
Do you think Venture firm should still

1148
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,447
Be investing in

1149
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
In consumer

1150
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,007
Barry White

1151
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,847
Square knot

1152
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,127
Categories app

1153
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,663
This is where you like them

1154
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,783
Even

1155
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,575
Cordon of course

1156
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
I love you

1157
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:25,023
Because

1158
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
Marv Jenson

1159
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,423
Part of the excitement

1160
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,983
Was that affected connectivity

1161
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,263
The hardware parts

1162
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,055
Would become less important

1163
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
N.

1164
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,127
Software update

1165
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,431
Woodstock Outlet

1166
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Entirely different category

1167
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,503
Business model

1168
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:50,879
And open the door to Ultrazone

1169
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,903
Business model

1170
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,511
2 today

1171
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,047
Tianjin Pool Products

1172
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,911
So let's move

1173
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
From consumers

1174
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
It's so dead

1175
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,543
Let's talk about this idea

1176
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,847
Building infrastructure for the iot

1177
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,895
Because I think that's going to get us into some

1178
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,967
Enterprise efforts and some of the Industrial

1179
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,247
So

1180
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,039
When you're talking about

1181
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,367
Infrastructure you brought it to Cloud Edge

1182
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
Connectivity

1183
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,183
I'm curious

1184
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,743
Where you sink kind of the most action

1185
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,047
Happened in the most mature sex

1186
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,167
CBD

1187
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:35,935
In the lab

1188
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:40,543
You're good news for the entire space

1189
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,079
Thundercloud

1190
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
Pink weave

1191
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:48,479
The first phase were a lot of the top 5 providers

1192
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,271
Largely assumed that

1193
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:53,343
Their core Legacy Cloud offering

1194
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,903
Turn the needs of iot companies

1195
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
Pretty well

1196
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,207
But I think

1197
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,255
As always

1198
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:04,863
The detail nothing Quinn company started working on top of the clouds

1199
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,983
The good news is that so

1200
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,079
You're the story of announcements providers offering

1201
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:24,063
Google jumped into The Fray and launched the iot Cloud Core

1202
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,087
So now you have

1203
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,767
Which Cloud offering Hawaii

1204
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
Because

1205
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,887
As we all know cloud computing

1206
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,935
Accelerate

1207
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
The number

1208
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,199
Edge computing

1209
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:51,967
No mortgage

1210
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,903
Intelligence

1211
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:05,023
Two node level sensor

1212
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:08,351
They can do different things we can decide what

1213
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,911
Come to the cloud

1214
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,431
Send everything

1215
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
That's even better

1216
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,671
Is true actually have the notes

1217
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,695
Decision

1218
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,975
That's one step

1219
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,791
Direction intelligence

1220
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:41,887
Connect to eventually

1221
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,423
And what about the

1222
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,471
Connectivity is Richmond

1223
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,799
Shooting range connectivity witches in the world

1224
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,847
Your Bluetooth and wifi

1225
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,015
Front Range Clinic

1226
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
That is a Shelly

1227
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,831
Well-dressed problems

1228
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,415
Up until now how much

1229
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,439
Lift well

1230
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,487
Problem with long range

1231
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,791
Guanaria Weathersby

1232
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:18,239
So early entrance like the clock example that's created a

1233
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,775
Network

1234
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,103
Connect in a way that

1235
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,919
Consuming too much

1236
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:31,295
Battery for the question

1237
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,063
Things to do

1238
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:37,439
Waiting for a response

1239
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:49,471
NB iot

1240
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,919
Call Frank

1241
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:12,511
Launch carriers as well as some during 15

1242
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:16,351
Are thinking about this issue and that therefore this issue

1243
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,631
Eventually go away

1244
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,191
Picture if I think about

1245
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,727
In the space force

1246
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
I'm interested

1247
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,311
Space but just technology

1248
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,359
Feel like we have

1249
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,127
Moved

1250
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895
Towards

1251
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,431
More distributed

1252
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,455
Ways of

1253
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,247
And now

1254
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,039
With the Internet of Things

1255
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,575
We're trying to make something

1256
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
Even more disturbing

1257
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,135
More diffuse

1258
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,719
And so when I look at startups in this space

1259
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,023
That's what gets me really excited

1260
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,327
Sinister decentralisation aspect

1261
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,863
You mentioned in your

1262
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,631
SA

1263
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,471
So I feel like we should talk about the rule of blotchy

1264
00:51:55,775 --> 00:52:01,919
The blockchain conceptually

1265
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,199
Well with the name

1266
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:06,015
Call Steve mobile

1267
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,319
Connected objects one

1268
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,855
Kia Spectra

1269
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:11,903
Providing

1270
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
Shorty

1271
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,999
Which says that we know has become

1272
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
Dairy

1273
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,839
Important aspect

1274
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,191
Wait. You're moving into my next topic

1275
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,727
So

1276
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:30,079
We'll talk about that in the second like I think it's interesting

1277
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,103
One of the things I can

1278
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,151
Authentication

1279
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,455
Which is sort of like secure

1280
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,247
Credibility

1281
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,039
And I also think it's interesting

1282
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,063
For things like

1283
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
Micropenis

1284
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,391
Antenna digital transactions

1285
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,951
Without between are things which I think is

1286
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,767
I think that is if that's not going to be a big trend

1287
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,815
This coming year it should be a big trend

1288
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:51,583
The following

1289
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,399
Because it's essential and we can't get any

1290
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,215
The General

1291
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,263
Concepts of data Exchange

1292
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
Your

1293
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:12,831
Temperature to talk to your connected

1294
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:16,159
Refrigerator

1295
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
Or

1297
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,023
But if you can tie those objects

1298
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,047
What's the blockchain

1299
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:30,495

Skip forward to

1303
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,759
Security and it's cousin privacy

1304
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
Because

1305
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,319
You talked a lot about security

1306
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:47,135
Port so I'm curious but then you didn't talk at all about

1307
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:47,903
Privacy

1308
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:54,303
And I'm really interested in how both on the consumer side and on the Enterprise how concerns about

1309
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,839
Privacy and what happens to people

1310
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,399

00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,775
So let's kick it off with security

1313
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,823
Assurity is

1318
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,191

00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:12,383
Problem for the industry in general because he continues to be

1330
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,407
Not because

1331
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,199
They don't think that's dirty

1332
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,735
Is importance butts

1333
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,527

Sell more products

1337
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:40,799
And then you know I have a little bit of sincerity but then.

1338
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,335
Later when

1339
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,919
Global products in the field

1340
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,967
So now let's talk about privacy

1341
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:48,991
Because

1342
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,551
I didn't see it and I'm curious about your thoughts

1343
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,575
How

1344
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,879
Concerns over privacy and data

1345
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,415
On the consumer

1346
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
Enterprise side

1347
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,231
Affect us in the area

1348
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,023

Kingsley Portland

1353
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,527
Something that the entire industry need to

1354
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,063
Think about

1355
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,391

Tricky situations tomorrow

1359
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,967
In some cases a lack of privacy in the ability to

1360
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,991
Collect data

1361
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,783
Core of a lot of these business model

1362
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,831
Whether it's consumer or if it

1363
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,599

Like what how a motor sound so you

1366
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:01,951
Predictably predict

1367
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,999
I think that is

1368
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,047
True at the same time

1369
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,351
Think you can address

1370
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,375
Privacy

1371
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:13,983

The business decision to spend a fair amount of time and effort

1388
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,127

Big emerging paradigm
