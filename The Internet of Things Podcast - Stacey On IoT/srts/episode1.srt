1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,096
Hey everybody it is Stacey Higginbotham and my colleague

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:11,776
Kevin tofel and this is sorry I caught you off-guard there Kevin but we have not

3
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:18,176
Talked in awhile so you kind of threw me for a loop there we go this is this is the first time we are recording the internet

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,272
Set of things podcast as it is now called without

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,576
Without the gator on Logo because

6
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,600
He know I'm his

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,160
Well it is it is no more

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:34,560
And so you're still here we're still here and we're still friends and we still love The Internet of Things

9
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:40,704
We're trying this on our own we'll see how it does and you guys have actually been super supportive in

10
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,288
A little demanding asking us to keep this thing going

11
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,872
So we will we're going to give it our best shot

12
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,432
We do what we're told we aim to please

13
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
We do

14
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
And so first off we'll get started with the device that I have been trying out in my home

15
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
It's a device I recommend to lots of people so you know ye it is called the Staples connect

16
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,280
At home hub

17
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,840
I had tried out initially a couple

18
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,888
Gosh over a year-and-a-half ago now

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
About a year-and-a-half ago these tables connect home hub version 1 now I've got the second version which is manufactured by.

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,104
I think it actually came out in August

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
But

22
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,688
I know so long ago

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
But

24
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,040
I hadn't gotten a chance to plug it in until now

25
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,136
I hadn't had it in my house until a couple weeks ago so I

26
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,488
Popped it in the house I tried it out and

27
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
I got to say

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,656
I still like this thing a lot I really do I love the way it works I think it has

29
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,936
A pretty great

30
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,984
Array of devices for people

31
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,312
And a wonderful UI for people who are

32
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,104
You know interested in the hub

33
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,176
Ecosystem right who are interested in connecting a lot of things

34
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:00,576
It has five radios so this version they added two more radios Bluetooth and zigbee

35
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,160
To their existing radios which were Wi-Fi

36
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,208
Z-Wave and Lutron

37
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:10,560
And it's kind of the Lutron that makes this a little different because

38
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Not

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
When it launched not everyone had Lutron

40
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,776
A couple other hubs like wink now has Lutron but this works way better than the wink hub

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,384
I'm not going to go there but I never ask you a question so

42
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,480
The difference between version 1 and version 2 it's obviously the new radios

43
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,064
Is there a price difference at all and and what other

44
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624
What other changes have been made to this hub

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
So

46
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,744
Earlier Hub was manufactured by Linksys

47
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,608
And then Cisco sold off Linksys and sold it to Belkin

48
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,008
I'm in Belkin so

49
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,080
So now this Hub is manufactured by D-Link

50
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,128
Which also has its own a smart

51
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,712
Camera lineup the Arlo light up with gear

52
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,528
But it doesn't have a hub so it makes this one

53
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:10,976
Probably is a price differential but since the other Hub isn't out there anymore it doesn't really matter

54
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
So

55
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,352
There's no real comps there right now they're doing a deal

56
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:22,752
I believe the Hub is 7999 if you bought it on your own very expensive but don't do that

57
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
Do I loved you

58
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,664
This is actually pretty good one so if you buy two connected devices

59
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
At Staples

60
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,528
42999

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,808
Airbus

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,624
You will get the Hub free

63
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,232
So basically you should just go spend sixty bucks on connected devices

64
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,632
Bright light switches or Outlets or lights or something yeah switches Outlets

65
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,936
I'm going to spend a little bit more and all honesty

66
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,520
I personally like would go out and get

67
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,128
Like this this would be me right I would go get maybe some Hue Lights

68
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,784
Were packing a Lutron dimmer I'm a huge fan of the Lutron stuff you guys know this

69
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832
Or if you want to get like a

70
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,136
They got the Arlo cameras they've got

71
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:16,512
Support for one of my favorite devices which is the Jasco outdoor links

72
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,839
That's great around Christmas time I know it's not Christmas time but

73
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,887
You know any time you got outdoor

74
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,191
Lights are things you want to plug in

75
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
I love those things

76
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
I think

77
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,335
I bought mine on Amazon for

78
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,943
I want to say they were about 25 bucks so that may not get you there

79
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479
But

80
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
I think they're more expensive inside the store

81
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,647
So and being a cross-platform guy

82
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:49,535
Can I use this with iOS Android and anything else you can use it with IOS and Android

83
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
They also have a web browser

84
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,399
What I've noticed that they did and I think this is really

85
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,191
A very smart move

86
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
Is they started

87
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
Doing two things

88
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,823
1 is

89
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
When your

90
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,455
Looking to add on to your system they ask you things like

91
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,783
Do you want to manage your home security

92
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,807
Or

93
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
You know

94
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,927
Have your lights to something you don't have your lights turn on

95
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
When you walk in the door

96
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,767
Did they offer you little scenarios and then

97
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,607
Then you should buy a connected light switch

98
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
Shopping

99
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,007
And that that's actually kind of nice it's giving you little hints about what you can do with these products

100
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,823
And that's that's a good idea because a lot of people

101
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,407
Don't know when you say I have a smart home what what does that mean what can I do with it

102
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,967
You can have 50 different options that people

103
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,063
Probably don't know about right or is like do you want to buy a motion sensor here like

104
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,159
Well I don't know

105
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:54,559
So I like that and then the other things they're doing is they're actually doing a lot with the data on the back end

106
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,119
For both consumers and retailers

107
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
So on the consumer side

108
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,519
They'll show you their they're working really hard to show you

109
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,871
If you have the following three products in your home you might also like to buy

110
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
This product

111
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,735
It fits well with these other products that you have

112
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:19,135
And on the retailer side they're showing the retailer the same sort of data and then offering them the chance to go

113
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,695
Give you coupons or

114
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,815
Special discounts or maybe an email marketing campaign towards you

115
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:35,775
You may or may not like us

116
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
I'll steal from the company

117
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,967
That's in my backyard practically Pennsylvania's it from his own off so this software back into

118
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Amazon AWS

119
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
That does all of this stuff end

120
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,903
I noticed by poking around in the app a little bit

121
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,767
A couple things that aren't available today like appliances

122
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,119
It kind of hint to me that maybe we're going to see some cool stuff in the future

123
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,519
Like appliances I'm actually on their webpage right now

124
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,919
Now and they say that they're suffer framework scales across mobile devices and such which we knew that already but also HGTV

125
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:20,319
These Blu-ray players clock radios picture frames so you could really start seeing a lot of smart

126
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,623
Devices around the home that we don't think of today

127
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,671
True I know that they

128
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
So

129
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,535
Zod provides the backend software for the Salton Sea

130
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
Remote control blinds

131
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,167
Which is kind of high and proprietary

132
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
Home system

133
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
Hours for my blood

134
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:45,919
It's so they do that and I talked to the

135
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,247
Paseo Mike Harris the other day and he mentioned to me that

136
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,087
We should expect in the coming months to see new channel partners

137
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
So

138
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:59,487
I'm very eager to see what he's got there and he also mentioned to me because

139
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
I don't know if

140
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,095
I guess we haven't talked about this cuz we've been on Hiatus for a couple weeks

141
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
But Amazon

142
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Has

143
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
Put a call out for Developers

144
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,079
Porous SDK there that I've actually started releasing an s2k for its Echo

145
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,895
I don't know if you remember this but when

146
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:23,295
I was trying out the echo the one thing I really wanted to do was command the echo to do things like open my blinds are turn off my lights

147
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,415
Softcore says like Mike are you guys going to work with the

148
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Amazon STK

149
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,535
He said that was something they wanted to do so

150
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,959
Song Welcome to do that too I know so I'm hoping that that comes because they had actually had a deal with

151
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
Ivy the voice controlled alarm clock

152
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
That didn't

153
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,151
Work out so well on the Staples end I don't think Staples offers that product anymore

154
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
But

155
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:55,295
You know in my quest for home automation voice control is really high up there

156
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
One day

157
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:01,183
I agree if the invisible interface I said that for years

158
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
Did you write I've heard you for years

159
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
I'm sorry

160
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:10,911
No it's okay there's a reason you're here

161
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,007
I'm going to go check out my Staples now because

162
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,799
I'm kind of excited by that you

163
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,127
It's a good deal in Uno if you don't mind

164
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,175
Swapping out your light switches

165
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,295
I really love the Lutron stuff I know it's an old interface

166
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,855
But it works so well oh

167
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
And

168
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,439
For all of you guys out there who really like

169
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:39,327
Who really like lighting and I know I get in trouble every time I talk about lighting I'm sorry Mia culpa

170
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
But

171
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:47,007
This is the only platform that I've experienced so far that I can actually use the Lutron Pico remote

172
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
To control both my Lutron lights

173
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,919
And any other lights that are tied into the platform

174
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,223
So I can control my Hue Lights

175
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,807
My like zigbee or other lights

176
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
In

177
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,903
All of that on one little remote control which is

178
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,951
I'm going to say it pretty darn handy

179
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,303
That's nice I know you like your remote controls as opposed to using

180
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,399
Your phone so that's that's that's great

181
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,823
Picking up the phone unlocking the phone and opening the app on your Apple watch don't worry

182
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,663
Like I'm buying the Apple watch showing all your experience with user I think

183
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
I am weight

184
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,295
But you have an iPhone are you going to buy the Apple watch use a mall

185
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:37,695
ISO from Windows phone all the way on up or down the stack are we going to look at it I don't know I'm still not

186
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Not convinced

187
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
That is going to do

188
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,583
Enough for the price for me if I do get when I will say this right up front

189
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,911
I'll probably get the smaller one not just cuz it's $50 cheaper

190
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,959
But also because

191
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
I'll get the sport model

192
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,543
43409 so

193
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,639
I'll save some money there I don't want spend five six hundred or more on on a watch

194
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
Not smart watch

195
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,759
Okay is that is a lot of money to spend on a watch

196
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
And

197
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
So

198
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,367
What would you what are you most looking

199
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,415
Forward to about the Watcher does it

200
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
Meet your needs

201
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:16,351
That's the thing. You know I wear an Android Wear watch now and it I think meets my needs better

202
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:20,703
Because of the Google Now contextual notifications that pop up throughout the day

203
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
And you don't have that with

204
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,799
With an Apple Watch at least not out of the gate

205
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
On the flip side is

206
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,919
You're locked in if you buy an Android Wear watch you can only use it with

207
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,247
Android phone and I don't always use an Android phone so

208
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
I may just buy an Apple Watch I don't know I also

209
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,647
Back the pebble time so I have that coming in May

210
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,183
Which is cross platform

211
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,583
Well and you also I mean the Apple watch is the same thing I made it only works with the iPhone

212
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
Exactly what I like.

213
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,191
Yeah that's why I backup Pebble time quite honestly

214
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,495
I prefer a cross-platform solution

215
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
Pretty much anything I need these days

216
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
So

217
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:02,175
I don't want to have to worry about what device I'm using who made it and what software runs

218
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,991
I would just want to use apps and services

219
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,015
Across

220
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,807
My choices and

221
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
So

222
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,135
I don't know yet but I'm not

223
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,535
I'm not sold on the Apple watch I will say this haven't used it at the end when it actually for a little while at the Apple event

224
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Earlier this month

225
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,631
Even though it does a lot of the same things as the Android Wear watch

226
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
In typical Apple fashion it does

227
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
Have a very elegant fluid

228
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Way of doing things

229
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,615
I do think they got away from their Simplicity a little bit but you're

230
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,479
You stuck with a small screen and few buttons it's very hard to keep things simple with user experience so

231
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
Jury still out yet on that

232
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,647
Well I do also I remember you writing many many many

233
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
Months ago or maybe it's years ago even

234
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,047
You know nobody knows what they want a smartwatch to be

235
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,863
So it's very hard to design

236
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,959
A simple interface for something when you don't know what it what it really is yet

237
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
Yeah this isn't evolving category and

238
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,335
It's going to change and there's no doubt about it

239
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,663
I think back to when the first iPhone came out in 2007

240
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
That was kind of a turning point for the smartphone era

241
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:15,391
But it was really about a year later that we really got what we all wanted in that was apps and it's going to take time for the

242
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,439
The Apple watch to get its abscess while so

243
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,999
This is going to be an interesting year of evolution I think

244
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
And maybe maybe

245
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,095
Interfacer

246
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
The model for the watch isn't apps

247
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,703
I kind of look at that and I think

248
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:35,871
I really think it could be sensors in just like an interface or just providing additional context in

249
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,431
In that situation you don't even need

250
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,479
Apps per say you just need

251
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,551
Sensors interacting with things around yuan

252
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
Yep that's it

253
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:51,487
At that point it also becomes a presence indicator and identity indicator and there's a lot of other things that are

254
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Not

255
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,815
Abcentric that this could work

256
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
4

257
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
In the future so

258
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:03,775
But then you need you need a lot more around the watch that works with a watch for that

259
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
To actually

260
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,847
For it to be valuable enough to people

261
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,663
A whole ecosystem I know an apple

262
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,783
Apples good at that again though I think

263
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
I think

264
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:22,975
You would have to have homekit be already out in the market I think it's going to be hard if you're not cross platform

265
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
I think

266
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
As the ecosystem

267
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Gets

268
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,983
Wider as it spans more than just a phone in more than just a computer and it starts didn't touch

269
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,847
Every aspect of Our Lives it becomes really hard to be so vertically integrated

270
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,175
I guess or so to have such a wall Garden

271
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,223
It is a challenge

272
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:49,343
But it's also a challenge that Apple has face before and they have experience with it

273
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,999
And some people like to be inside Apple's world nothing there something wrong with that and it's perfectly fine. You know I know I know

274
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,071
I'm not like everybody I was actually happy to hear that

275
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,631
Android where may I should be coming to iOS

276
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
In which case you could use an Android Wear

277
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
Watch with an iPhone

278
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,543
I don't think it'll give you the best integrated experience because of that

279
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
Vertical integration that's

280
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
That's missing

281
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
But

282
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,967
I might be happy enough with that again I I like Choice that's just that's just me

283
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
Okay fair enough

284
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:26,207
I want to say I also want to draw your attention to the fact that Google Now did they talked about

285
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:31,583
An open API for Google now so you might actually get Google Now on your Apple watch

286
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,935
You know two things come to mind here or you can already get

287
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,799
Google Now notifications on iOS devices if you install the Google Search app

288
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,383
It feels in which is really clever of Google in my opinion

289
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,015
So you know I'm using an iPhone today and I already had a couple of contextual notifications pop up

290
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:55,135
So pushing us over to an Apple Watch really shouldn't be a big deal because it's just a notification

291
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,511
But as far as Google Now itself it and the openness of that that's

292
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Coming there

293
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,607
This is becoming a whole little mini platform for Google

294
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:11,007
Please Google Now cards that start out with just basic contextual things that it learns from you about your penis through your email

295
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,847
Baylor Fort Worth to other Google service interactions

296
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:21,247
Now that they're opening this up to developers yeah it's great to have you know a little cards that pop up from apps that say hey

297
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
You're near

298
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,855
The coffee shop you want to check on the FourSquare or something

299
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,439
It is bridging at that gap between the app and

300
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
And having to

301
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:37,119
Please unlock your phone go to the right app and so on apps come to you that information comes to you and I think that is really

302
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,679
We're Google now it's going to be 6 continue to be successful

303
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
I cannot wait

304
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,823
I think that's probably a good place to end today or this this note of optimism

305
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
And

306
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,455
We'll stay tuned for our guests who is Brady Forest of

307
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,015
PCH Highway 1 incubator

308
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,367
And he's going to talk about how to build products that don't suck

309
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:05,279
Which I'm really excited about make them cross platform

310
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,935
But we did talk about making sure that you know they work and support usually

311
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,751
Yeah well you know you'd be surprised how many don't work

312
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
So

313
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
Or maybe you wouldn't cuz you talk to me and you experience the joys of them not working yourself I only buy the ones that were

314
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,551
I on the other hand by all kinds of stuff but I'm going to Staples that's it

315
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,391
There you go well if you if you do set it up let me know what you think because

316
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
Right now

317
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,767
That's probably the best platform out there for the mainstream consumer I would say

318
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
Alright house I will let you know

319
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351

00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,711
Is an accelerator is part of the

324
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,735
PCH

325
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,831
I will call it Manufacturing in fulfillment house is that the best

326
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
Version of peace

327
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,719
TCS designs Custom Manufacturing Solutions

328
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:13,119
What is a handle company supply chain

329
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
And so they

330
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,239
How companies make things that help companies move things around

00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,263
Package them

332
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799

00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,807
Highway 1 is PCH

339
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
Accelerator

340
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,623
And Brady manages that

341
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
So that means Brady is your guy

Awesome I know all go home after after the

349
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,951
All right and you probably will I know you guys who listen to the show have heard of these companies because I

350
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Talk about them so

351
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
Some of the ones I know you've heard of would-be

352
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
Wrigley

353
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,351
The drop kitchen scale

354
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,423
I'm trying to think of others that I know I've talked about I

355
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:26,335
Well I don't know what are some of your I won't say favorites Brady cuz I'm sure you love them all but what are some of the ones that I know

356
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,919
I know have hit the market cuz we try to talk about things that are mostly on the market

357
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,247
Things that are

358
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,599
Let's let's do mostly on the market and you can throw in one or two

359
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
Are available on crowdfunding

360
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,023
Sure I mean I think right now it's really just dropping ring

361
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:50,143
Things that will be available sooner rather than later or birdie and Toto

362
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
NFC

363
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:56,799
Things that justic crowdfunding yesterday or switchmate photo

364
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,847
Okay

365
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
Which is a Bluetooth

366
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,271
Oh yes I got excited about I'm a real fan of buttons

367
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:10,111
I love to press things to make things happened as opposed to

368
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
Relying on my smartphone

369
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
I'm so

370
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
Button fan

371
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
Okay

372
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
So

373
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,679
The reason Brady is on the show is because a couple weeks ago I just got so fed up

374
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,983
With getting devices that didn't work

375
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
And

376
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,591
I am constantly testing devices so part of this is

377
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
My job

378
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
Is getting these connected devices in

379
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
Playing with them

380
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,783
But after probably 2 years of doing this

381
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,111
And they showing things off to my friends and having that moment of like

382
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:47,231
Please please please I just talk to sub to everybody and pressing a button and then nothing happening

383
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,815
And my friends going wow this is really awesome

384
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
I realized that

385
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:57,471
The smart home is never going to take off at this is the user experience that people have when they spend you know

386
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
Two hundred bucks on a device in

387
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
It only works half the time

388
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
So

389
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
I thought because

390
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,431
So far the two devices that

391
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,247
And there's more than just too but

392
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
PCH

393
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,063
In my my

394
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,111
Highway 1 devices it really works

395
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Well

396
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,928
Out of all the devices that I've tried

397
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
So I thought you'd be a good person to talk about

398
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,024
When devices

399
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,608
You know when can they actually be kind of like

400
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
Beta devices and then

401
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
How do you get

402
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
A device into the hands of

403
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,240
Consumers that does work

404
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,312
And isn't kind of an iterative process while it's out of the market

405
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
So

406
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
Let's start

407
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
Brady with

408
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
Gosh

409
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
When can a device be

410
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,272
I guess in beta still

411
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
And Beyond

412
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:51,232
Because there's no

413
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,304
There's no registry that says Okay a product is finished

414
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,632
And reality is

415
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,472
That said there's a big difference between

416
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
Thug

417
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,800
Where it

418
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,848
It doesn't

419
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,176
Which hopefully most of the things you're experiencing are bugs

420
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,456
And

421
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,736
Crab say

422
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
What's

423
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,344
Castle call designs on gourds

424
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,368
Which is

425
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,952
When it doesn't work the way it should but it is actually how they

426
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
I work

427
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
It's on the one case

428
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,400
Honestly I think

429
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,960
Which happens all the time

430
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
Or

431
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
They had

432
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,848
In a lot of the mobile platforms that these companies depend on

433
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
I have ever shifting

434
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
Code an API

435
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,272
And so sometimes the stack actually changes underneath though

436
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,576
Or you're using some configuration

437
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,112
But they were unable to test

438
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
Cuz I'm Lottery

439
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
AR

440
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,816
Constantly changing for Developers

441
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,632
Hundreds of thousands of Android phones

442
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
Numerous

443
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,960
Bluetooth stacks

444
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:09,824
There's thousands of Wi-Fi router

445
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,384
Docker Network stopped working

446
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,664
Elizabeth connection

447
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,528
There's also the design flaws

448
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
And that's when

449
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,136
The inventor has come up with something they think

450
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184
A device

451
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,512
But let's say a switchmate

452
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,560
You design it to turn off your lights

453
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
From your phone

454
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
But

455
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,216
Like what you said Stacy you don't want to turn off the lights

456
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
So

457
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
When you first get it

458
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,176
Definitely turns off

459
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,480
Your lights whenever you want to

460
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
You don't like you got an erection

461
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,648
And you wish it did something more until in that way this kind of

462
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,952
Failed in that scenario for you

463
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,024
Okay well in India time

464
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,584
I'm less concerned about that because

465
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
I am forgetting that you know

466
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,448
The people who are building these products

467
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,240
You know they have a limited

468
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,312
They're usually startups they have maybe

469
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,360
Five or ten people on a team they can't get

470
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,760
I feel like if you meet your specs that you've advertised to me

471
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
You're doing great

472
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,576
That's all I want

473
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,648
I would say though

474
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
That

475
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
So so let's

476
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,816
Let's talk about the ways that you can fail the consumer cuz I think that's that's probably really relevant

477
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,400
Phelous

478
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:42,240
You can fail in many ways as Hess I have discovered throughout my life

479
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:46,080
So there's there's the failure of a product

480
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,896
Working as advertised and I think

481
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,200
One way that this happens is

482
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,016
When someone launches like on Kickstarter

483
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,320
Or promotes their product

484
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
There is

485
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,720
They often have the list of basic features it'll do the following things

486
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:07,072
And then I have the list of like things they would like to have and then they have things that

487
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,656
They promised when they talked to reporters about

488
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,680
What they're doing

489
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,264
And sometimes that all gets kind of muddled together

490
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
I don't know if you've noticed that

491
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:21,664
I don't know what the advice is and I see this all the time I mean I see it with like

492
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,528
Products that talks about algorithms especially they're like oh it's going to anticipate your every need

493
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,856
But that's not going to come out for another six months after we launched

494
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
Great

495
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
And really my everything

496
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
I don't know

497
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,816
That sounds awesome I'm going to totally Bacchus fresh

498
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
So

499
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,448
When you when you think about that is is that somewhat

500
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:48,288
What would you advise companies to do do you think they should be

501
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
Talking about those

502
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:56,480
Things do you think it's maybe people like me the reporters who are like all this sounds great

503
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
A little bit I got to admit

504
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,088
Well I think that

505
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,904
Companies should always be clear when that

506
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,792
What is its width Now versus what it will ship with

507
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
And

508
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:16,704
I think they should be clear when something is going to require a lot of customers to get

509
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,240
2 scale

510
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,032
And so

511
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,360
When it's something that's going to anticipate your every need

512
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,384
Comedian

513
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
That says

514
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:30,784
What has alot of data it will be able to figure out what users in various situations do

515
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,624
The thing is they shouldn't over promise those things because

516
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,696
Until they hit mescale they won't hit

517
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
No scenarios

518
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,560
And so they won't know what to do and that is stereos

519
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,352
And the reality is still never

520
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
Every scenario

521
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,168
Even Google it

522
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
You know

523
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,312
I forget the percentage but it's never seen everyday

524
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,920
Google

525
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,736
More queries that have multiple pets

526
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
User cache

527
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,624
Don't have that advantage

528
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,904
And so small

529
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,512
Companies that are trying to take advantage of user data is it only have a small user base

530
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
They're not going to

531
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,840
Be able to anticipate your every need

532
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
That is a real bummer

533
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
But you're probably right

534
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,728
And what about

535
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,312
What about Baseline features cuz this is another

536
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,640
Spot where I see companies fail so

537
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:32,480
For example I recently tried out a home security system

538
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
That

539
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,856
And in this might be good for birdie because birdie is a home security

540
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,416
Customer in air quality monitoring system isn't it

541
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,720
Air quality monitor

542
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,256
Is a scary

543
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
That's right different birds

544
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,608
I'm so pretty air quality NVM

545
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,936
So I tried out a home security system

546
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,984
And what are the things that

547
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,032
Actually wasn't a future but

548
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,568
It should have been a future in

549
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,592
Maybe now

550
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,152
Was but it didn't notify me when it went offline

551
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
I thought that was

552
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,528
You know a glaring failure

553
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,576
In the product that

554
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,160
Wasn't even part of the design specs so

555
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,488
And they could add it later right and I'm sure they did

556
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
But

557
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,840
So that that's okay swear it wasn't a bug it was just

558
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
I guess that design

559
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,680
Failure in

560
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728
I don't know how like

561
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,288
To think about things like that and how

562
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,592
You prevent something like that on the product

563
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,616
Design side

564
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176
How do you advise your company's

565
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
I think about things

566
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
Like that

567
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,320
Well we try to get our company is to

568
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:44,160
Beta units into the hands of customers as soon as possible

569
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,976
And that's that's how you that's how you figure that out

570
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:53,632
Bluetooth controller

571
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,520
Several small let's say Alpha

572
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Runs

573
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,152
IMusic sometimes like 3D printed super ugly and I sent them

574
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,712
All over the US

575
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,504
Just to see how people would use them

576
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,856
And that's how they realize that they still needed to be able to turn on the lights manually

577
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,392
Not just

578
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,232
They had one user

579
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,792
Actually you know knock it off the wall and break it

580
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,840
Nothing really like

581
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,376
Treat this like a

582
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
We need to ask

583
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,544
Insulated rubber gasket to add more friction

584
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:39,968
And they also put a little buffer unit around the XL controller so that the the end product

585
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,272
Could stand up to

586
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,600
Getting your product

587
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,648
To customers to see how to use it

588
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,232
Is how you find these laws

589
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
Another example is

590
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,096
Current lettuce with their product

591
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
They launched

592
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
Kickstarter beta

593
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
In January

594
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,984
They

595
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,336
Did the kickstarter a confidence 30 units I believe

596
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
Sold out in 24 hours

597
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,200
And all the customers who bought it

598
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
Will get

599
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
A new Fitbit

600
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,552
When the real product comes out

601
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,624
Or at least 10

602
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,440
Promised by signing up for this Kickstarter

603
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,744
That they will send feedback

604
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,304
And help inform the team about the product

605
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,352
When actually ship

606
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,168
Orlin actually wants the real crowdfunding campaign

607
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,496
Deliver the experience they want

608
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,824
We pick up people to pay for the device that they're going to test

609
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
That's awesome

610
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:50,112
You'll have the features

611
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
And I can control the heater and lights

612
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,464
This is a fully functioning device

613
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
However

614
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,840
It won't be the exact experience they want

615
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,680
They're still learning how to interact with it with the software

616
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,752
So I mean

617
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
These are going to be expensive

618
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:13,152
Current isn't going to make any money

619
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:18,784
No they didn't even find the cost of like

620
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
The original betas

621
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
Even offset the cost

622
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
Beta unit

623
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
It's great

624
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
Okay

625
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,120
So that's that's good feedback in the fact that maybe maybe you can even get people like

626
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,656
If you have some sort of product that

627
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:38,496
Really hankering for you can even get them to offset the cost of your Betta is great

628
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,824
The other

629
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
But let's talk about cutting the complicated

630
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,712
That you can fail with bugs because I think

631
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,992
That's where a lot of this

632
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
Happens

633
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,320
In this is super hard

634
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,904
And you brought us a really good points and I don't know how to

635
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
I don't know how

636
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,720
Companies can deal with this

637
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,072
The idea that there are so many platforms

638
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,912
Then the idea that their people are clamoring for Integrations

639
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,752
So if you got a connected device that you're trying to

640
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
Launch

641
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,920
Do you recommend that people start with maybe one platform like maybe just iOS

642
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,736
Get it out on the market and then try to

643
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:24,576
Build for Android is that one way to control kind of the Experian

644
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
Or

645
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,184
Is that not good enough fight I don't know

646
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:35,328
I think simplifying the number

647
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,264
Limit the number of bugs and Stereos got to deal with I don't feel like people in the eye

648
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,056
Hold on Android for too long

649
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,848
Because there's still quite a

650
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:51,200
Salina technical world there's a lot of people who use Android

651
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,736
I'm an Android user

652
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,016
I will tell you that

653
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:00,416
Yeah I think it's quite tricky to to totally avoid

654
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,512
Keywords to get caught up in a lot of things

655
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,376
Scenarios around relying on other people's platforms

656
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:14,752
I'm so excited

657
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
Playground

658
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,568
Here at Highway 1

659
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,152
Where we have it so no sweetheart Hugh we have SmartThings

660
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,944
We have a nest

661
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,528
We will have a flex what kind of switchmate will have the birdie

662
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,832
So the people can test

663
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,368
How their device interacts

664
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,720
Actually get into the home

665
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,280
You know it's a work with SmartThings

666
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,072
You know it'll work with nest

667
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,632
Less people going to blonde

668
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,472
That magical experience

669
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
From you

670
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,800
Systems work together

671
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,640
Or they could send it to me cuz you just described my home

672
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,944
And I even have more if they want more

673
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:00,832
What we can put you on our business

674
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,208
Bacon bacon just be like I will send it to Stacy

675
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,792
Her home is a nightmare of epic proportions

676
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
Alright so

677
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,960
So let's see cuz cuz that is I will say

678
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,520
You know what I actually

679
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,568
The first thing when I get a device

680
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
I actually

681
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,128
Tested on its own Merit

682
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
That's before I

683
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
Hook it up to anything

684
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:26,944
Because

685
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,760
Because I fundamentally think it's unfair to be like

686
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:34,624
This is awesome now I'm going to break you with like hooking you up to 20 different things

687
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,696
Because I mankind

688
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Maybe I'm not

689
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,000
Find I don't know

690
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,840
What it comes to

691
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,192
The Integrations this is this is really tricky in

692
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
And I don't know

693
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,056
How your your companies and how you tell your company's

694
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,616
It is a consumer I don't

695
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,176
I know what I do but I don't know what the normal

696
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,968
So let's let's get your take on

697
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:06,368
Things don't always work even like when I test out my works with Nest integration

698
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,184
A perfect example will pick up big companies cuz

699
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,256
Cuz they have they have power they couldn't they can handle it

700
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,840
I was really excited about

701
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,888
The shoe works with Nest integration

702
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
Because I love my

703
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
Hewn

704
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
I like my nest

705
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,032
And I thought the integration was really clever

706
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,896
So I hooked it up and he was a great toggle

707
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,712
And then I noticed an idea was when you

708
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,528
Link your nest in your Hue Lights together

709
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
When your nest goes to away

710
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,904
After about a minute your Hue Lights will fade slowly off

711
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,440
And you will save energy

712
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,744
And if you

713
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,280
You're like oh that's so nice

714
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:50,144
And then if you're away for more than a day your Hue Lights will randomly go

715
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,728
On and off in a random pattern to mimic someone being at home

716
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
So you're like

717
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,544
So cool

718
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,360
Okay so I was sold I thought that was great

719
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,920
Turn it on and then

720
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,736
I had like a television crew in my house

721
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:10,112
And I'm like this is going to be great guys watch this I told them about this integration they're like

722
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,440
And then I turned I turn my Nest to away

723
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,720
And we're staring at the lights

724
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
And nothing has

725
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:21,376
I think it's going to take a minute they want you to be able to walk out of the house

726
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,912
Without

727
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,192
You know pump it into anything

728
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,240
They don't want the lights to all go off at once

729
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,544
So we're still staring at the lights and they're like

730
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,640
Nothing

731
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
Finally

732
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,688
We realized

733
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
It just didn't work

734
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,016
So I'm like

735
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:43,392
And because I me you know I have the ability to call both nest and Hue and be like yo guys

736
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,440
Disintegration it doesn't work what's going on

737
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:52,608
But a normal consumer they're like man this doesn't work who do I call you know do I called Nest to Echo hue

738
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:57,216
Both of these are actually have the consumer hotline which is nice

739
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,288
You have to go to the forums

740
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,872
Did they actually who pushed out an update

741
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,688
It was a couple people had needed an update

742
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,712
Make it work

743
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,760
The bottom line is

744
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
These don't always work

745
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,320
And

746
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,416
What are you tell your Custer your company's win like

747
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,488
They play with these big Partners or small partners

748
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,304
And our customers are like hey what's going on

749
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,072
Doesn't work

750
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,192
I always tell them to get out front

751
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
I mean

752
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,336
MC not more with

753
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,872
I see it was like

754
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,176
Manufacturing delays

755
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,296
Don't let people know that

756
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,576
Where you're at

757
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,624
And just be

758
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,904
Open about it

759
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
And I think

760
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
I need that

761
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,072
Some people need to realize or companies need to realize

762
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,096
Integrations

763
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:02,752
I mean you and consumers in your direction

764
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,800
After they already want your use case

765
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,360
So

766
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,408
In the case of IV

767
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,016
You want voice control for your phone

768
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,112
Fact that it works with nest and you have the nest

769
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,696
Like me and you in the direction of Ivy over say Amazon second

770
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,048
People want to sing

771
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
Financial platform

772
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,632
But

773
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,192
At its core it's going to be

774
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,984
Whether or not your device looks

775
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
Fair enough

776
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
So

777
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,128
Who can you who can you

778
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
Kind of test devices

779
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
Cuz

780
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,760
I do think that there is a market

781
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,832
That you can test devices on so is it your

782
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,928
Clearly labeled Kickstarter bettas like the is it

783
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
Fish bits

784
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
Was that the name of the company

785
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,328
Chris Peterson products

786
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
Okay fish bits

787
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
The fish pets product

788
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:07,008
Is it is it like a clearly labeled beta Kickstarter is it a normal kind of

789
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:11,360
Indiegogo or Kickstarter crowdfunded kind of thing either self-funded or however

790
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,176
Self-starter kind of thing

791
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,712
Or is it

792
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,784
It it's not at a brick-and-mortar level it's

793
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,344
Probably not on your website I don't know

794
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,648
At what point in time can you

795
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
Kind of

796
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,488
Have these preview Hardware things

797
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
Can I borrow a little glitchy

798
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,352
And at what point in time do you transition to something that

799
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,632
Pretty seamless for the end

800
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:39,008
I mean I think it's a chance on this on the company

801
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
And product

802
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,104
A lot of V ones

803
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,968
Regardless of the company in the size of the company

804
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,296
Are often the bugs just because

805
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,624
Actor Leinster bulbs

806
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,672
Call Sang

807
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,976
About your cello under

808
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
Many eyes

809
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,304
And

810
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,888
The reality of these teams are five people

811
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,424
7 people

812
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:13,312
Extended shipping to 30 people so they're going to catch a bunch of bugs

813
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,336
Obvious one

814
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,384
But it won't catch them all

815
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,432
And they won't catch them all

816
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,480
Even after this ship to 10000 people

817
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,552
They will still encounter new box

818
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,880
Encounter

819
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
Hopefully they'll fix

820
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:31,488
I'll be able to fix the bugs as they encounter them

821
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,560
New bugs

822
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:39,168
Best product

823
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,008
Okay so it's like don't buy it like

824
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,568
I remember a friend of mine bought the first

825
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,128
The first version of like the Mercedes

826
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,480
The first model year of the Mercedes like sport utility vehicle

827
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:57,344
Already hated that car and he was such a loyal Mercedes customers whole family about Mercedes all their lives

828
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,648
You know I was like dude

829
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,952
You just bought a Mercedes why are you complaining all the time

830
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:08,352
Kiddo that that kind of stuck with me I was like okay never by the first version of a

831
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,192
You make the Model T automobile

832
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,520
Don't buy the first version of a self-driving car

833
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,824
It's

834
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:18,848
There

835
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:24,224
Good companies are figuring this out they are figuring out

836
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
I mean

837
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,064
They are trying to create something new

838
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
And trying to create a company

839
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:34,208
Trying to figure out the company

840
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,768
The building that product

841
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
So

842
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,632
It can be a challenge to do both

843
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,168
At once

844
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,448
It's like

845
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,496
Building the airplane on your way down

846
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,336
Okay very scary

847
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:56,735
What happens if I mean because a lot of these are startups

848
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
What do you say

849
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,599
What do you recommend for these companies do they have like a

850
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:05,951
A parachute do they have an exit plan for their consumers or

851
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:11,839
What do you what do you tell them in case they go out of business and they leave people with

852
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,655
These connected devices that may or may not be so

853
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,679
Deported after

854
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
A year to

855
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:17,983
I mean

856
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:24,895
I onion I think that that's something that the iot states is going to encounter

857
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:29,247
And we'll need to figure out I think it's something that they can learn from the web

858
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,807
I remember when Billy was first coming out

859
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,623
And there was a lot of concern about how

860
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:40,255
URL shortener

861
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,279
You don't know

862
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,815
Where is actually meeting you too

863
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,351
And that's

864
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:47,167
And I brought on a lot of those

865
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:51,519
Ruined the world with rickrolling

866
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,823
Having perpetrated that way

867
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,615
Italy

868
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,919
Their credit

869
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
Argument

870
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:05,087
And said okay if we ever go out of business we are going to open source

871
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,671
Our or make available our database

872
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,695
Lynx

873
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,511
And so that other people can

874
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:17,631
USB is cuz we don't think you are going to go away but at least

875
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,911
Translate our links

876
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,959
And that really I think

877
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,591
But these people can

878
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:30,431
Still use the bit ly URL Survivor the well

879
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,223
And I think

880
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:36,575
Iot companies haven't hit that issue

881
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,111
Where

882
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,463
They are going to have to deal with

883
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
Their products going away

884
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,399
I think the first consumers

885
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,495
Yeah cuz the first one we have right now I think

886
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,847
Well it's probably not the first one but the biggest one that I can think of is the revolve Hub that

887
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Googlebot

888
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,151
Revolves in

889
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,711
Will stop supporting the Hub after a year

890
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,831
I mean in that that was a company that was bought by Google which is

891
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:12,159
Legitimately so legitimate business and

892
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
Piano

893
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,999
That's that's not just a

894
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,791
Zombie kind of company so

895
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:22,911
I don't know it is interesting I'm very curious of the devices that I have purchased

896
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
How many of them will be supported

897
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:30,335
Especially things that I have like unscrewed switch plates and rewired into my wall and like

898
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,687
I hope I don't have to risk dying of electrocution again

899
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,039
I'm reminded of the leave it loose

900
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,343
Yeah Microsoft

901
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:45,183
Trying to shut down some of those guns

902
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:51,839
Which method people would lose their music

903
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
Could have stopped at 3

904
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,471
Big big fat in soda

905
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,263
I believe they got stuck

906
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,287
Make a note

907
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,847
Now they got Legacy

908
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,895
Google can easily

909
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,223
You can picture the revolve code and system

910
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,295
Blowing into Nest right so they can easily

911
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,111
Sends a new nest

912
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,159
Every resolve user

913
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:20,511
Right but that that's a lot of radios to pack into some

914
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,559
So

915
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,607
I don't know

916
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:29,471
We'll see if Google calls us all upset hey wait

917
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,543
No promises on our behalf

918
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,359
Brady we have

919
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,663
We have solved we haven't really soft we have

920
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,479
Traded one intractable problem for another

921
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,063
But I appreciate your your thoughts on this because I was

922
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:49,183
At as I'm getting frustrated with things I will remind myself that there are lots of platforms

923
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,975
Their ever-changing

924
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:55,071
That you can't think of everything all at once and that

925
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,911
You know unless it's a gaping huge security bad that I feel is like

926
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,191
Ridiculously

927
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
Ridiculous

928
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,495
In the sense that

929
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,799
Really guys you probably should have had this

930
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:10,943
Maybe we can come up with some best practices that should just be baked into all designs or something like that

931
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:16,319
I will try to be a lot more forgiving of the

932
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
D Minor bugs and

933
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,951
Add the major ones to my best practices my mental best best practice

934
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,511
So thank you for coming on the show

935
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,071
