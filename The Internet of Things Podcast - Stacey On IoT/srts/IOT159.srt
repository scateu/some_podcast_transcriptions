00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,560
Plus is the Apple watch losing its apps

13
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,584
It doesn't matter

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,376
Comcast is adding stringify

15
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,424
We've got some exploits again

16
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,704
With iot

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,472
It devices

18
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:47,616
And some news plus we're going to talk about me installing the nest hello doorbell and what I think

19
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,432
And I dumped a device for my home

20
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,456
Because by golly it

21
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,272
Find out what that is

22
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,600
And hear from our Advertiser this week for a truck

23
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,928

It is a jam-packed show

26
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,424
So let's get it started with a message from our sponsor

27
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
This week sponsor is the yonomi platform for the makers of the free you know me after you know me platform is a

28
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
I'm faced platform-as-a-service for companies Building Solutions for the connected home you know he's offering

29
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
Include hidden Cloud the server list iot platform for device manufacturers looking to get their products to Market

30
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
Quickly and securely there's also you know me one a powerful integration engine that connects more than a hundred

31
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
Top smart home devices this week on the Stacey on iot podcast

32
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:50,080
Part three of their five-part series on what the next billion-dollar smart home startup will look like

33
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,480
You can find that today by visiting platform. You know me. Co / Stacy

34
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,344
Xeon iot yonomi is spelled y o n o m

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
I

36
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
Cake

37
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Man

38
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
Great episode

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
I realize that I say super all the time

40
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,656
We can start a drinking game with me being super excited or super happy

41
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Or

42
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
I don't know

43
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
So I'm trying to stop that let's see how well I do

44
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
Yucaipa

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
Crap a beverage and see what happens

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
All right

47
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
To get started

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Microsoft

49
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:33,088
They announced last week that they were going to spend 5 billion dollars over the next 4 years

50
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,368
Where's on the internet

51
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
Thanks

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
What do you think about

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,048
Well maybe they're there a big player we probably don't talk about them as much as we should

54
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:47,936
But cuz they're behind the scenes of a lot of things and what I liked about their news announcement witch

55
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,520
I would say the light on details on how they're going to invest

56
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
Even see anything

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
Earth shattering in there was a continuation of their efforts

58
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,176
What I like in there something that I've noted

59
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
With Google's IRT

60
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
Press announcements

61
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
Is often missing there was some

62
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,368
Real actual customers in here

63
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,696
And discussions of how these customers

64
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
Use

65
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,256
Microsoft platform

66
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280
4 IRT

67
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
When I say customers I mean

68
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,424
Steelcase color Chevron Johnson Controls United Technologies

69
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,728
The Alaska Department of Transportation which

70
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,312
That was kind of cool cuz they're building smart roadways to monitor weather conditions

71
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
So

72
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,384
They actually Microsoft

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,688
Their iot stuff and azure

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Are you spy

75
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Buy Hershey's

76
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
To make

77
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
Twizzler packets

78
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,856
Twizzlers candy

79
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
That's my backyard Hershey

80
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
So

81
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,744
They use it to make sure every Twizzlers package is packed with

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
The right amount

83
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
Whistlers

84
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,376
Because before they added sensors and analytics to this

85
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
Process

86
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,680
They actually were like

87
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
You had too many Twizzlers in a bag

88
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,056
That was fine but if you didn't have enough to meet the weight requirement

89
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
You had to just Jam more in

90
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
So they were

91
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,944
Are Twizzlers were not uniform enough

92
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
And so

93
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,296
They managed to save money by making them more uniform so they could

94
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,136
Dirty Woods of licorice production

95
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,720
Microsoft has some really good

96
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
Smurfs here and

97
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,071
I actually emailed them to get a little bit more in

98
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,863
Information did I get a lot more

99
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
But

100
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
Put this in context

101
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
Microsoft has spent

102
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
One point

103
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:33,151
5 billion over the last 4 years so this is a huge increase in their spending

104
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
In

105
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,967
They really talk about it

106
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
They're going to add

107
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
More people

108
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,063
They're going to do more in R&D

109
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,879
They're going to work more with

110
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,183
Their partner so a lot of this is going to be training

111
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
People and partners

112
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,999
Some hiring

113
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
And some cool stuff

114
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,375
And apparently this is a really important sentence to Microsoft because they sent it to me

115
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,423
Me twice in the same two paragraph email

116
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
But according to them

117
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:02,847
Quote by investing even more in iot we are committing the resources and Innovation to empower companies to

118
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
To take advantage

119
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,663
Iot and intelligent Edge

120
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
What does that mean

121
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
But

122
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
It does mean that Microsoft is a

123
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
Excited about iot

124
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,111
They actually also this week

125
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
Partnered with Tom siebel scump

126
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
Nac3

127
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,535
C3 is a platform-as-a-service that does alot of data analytics

128
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,119
And they got started in the energy space Benadryl and monitoring

129
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
Data for

130
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
Mini mini smart grid devices

131
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,007
And they really branched out into iot

132
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
I actually just last week did a deal with

133
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,407
Is it all in the industrial Enterprise side but

134
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,711
This is where the big money is so we were

135
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Moving right along

136
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
Qualcomm

137
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,599
Has New Vision intelligence chip

138
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
These are a new line of chips

139
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
They made

140
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
Television intelligence

141
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
It is basically

142
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
It's kind of like what

143
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
Nvidia switch Intel bios

144
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,423
And a couple weeks ago we actually announced it arm is going to have

145
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,311
Machine learning platform for the edge and Invidia is actually using its vision

146
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Processing

147
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,127
Engine on those

148
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
On the arm design

149
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,735
So everybody is really excited about computer vision at the edge

150
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
We can talk about it here

151
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
4 years

152
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
And so it's finally coming

153
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
To fruition

154
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,135
With cheap low-power silicon

155
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
These are the

156
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:28,351
IQs 603 and 605 chips and I actually got really excited when I read about where they

157
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,959
Are looking to apply the technology to where they expect people or companies to apply at

158
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
You'll see why in a second

159
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,591
Obvious example of security cameras Sports cameras wearable cameras

160
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,151
Virtual reality cameras here we go

161
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
Robotics

162
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
And smart displays

163
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
I just got excited with robot

164
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Yes

165
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,855
The ones with arms are the ones that you're

166
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Speaker on and have fun

167
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,511
The smart speaker on the Roomba I think I'll just wait and get one with arms now

168
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
There you go smart speakers

169
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Smart speakers

170
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607
Arbs and

171
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,399
That's what we need

172
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,703
Okay these are wifi-only

173
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Only chips

174
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
Just so you guys know

175
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Oh and

176
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,591
Qualcomm has been doing computer vision but they have been doing it on there

177
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
Snapdragon

178
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
Processor switcher actually design person

179
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,223
So having something specifically designed

180
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
The edge

181
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
A lot of sense

182
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
I'd actually

183
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
Because it's Wi-Fi you're not going to see the sun

184
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
So I guess the Snapdragon stuff will still be on

185
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,023
Oh I don't know about that cuz like a lot of the drums

186
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,863
To use like a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi to a connected tablet or phone for

187
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631

Favorite

189
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,239
Okay well maybe I will see this

190
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
You. We sure might I think

191
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,615
Black people use drones for the vision aspect obviously

192
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:49,247
The 605 chip that the more capable of that you can handle simultaneous 4K

193
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,831
And 1080p feeds at 60 frames a second

194
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
Suck your battery

195
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183
Small drones generally do

196
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
Sure

197
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,583
And I guess you know if you're thinking about staying in a room that's not

198
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,679
Okay so that's qualcomm's

199
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,215
Let's talk about

200
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:14,079
Kevin's story this week yesterday Kevin posted a story that was on Wednesday

201
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
About

202
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
Adding context

203
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
That's the big thing that's what we're always

204
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
About

205
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
Is really

206
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,183
I think there's an opportunity for home assistance and I don't know if people have thought about this weird people really want

207
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,279
Yes I know I do but I know I'm weird so that's okay if you don't want this

208
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
Are voice assistants are good at providing

209
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
Contextual information

210
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
When we asked for it but

211
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
Context means right place right time

212
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
So why it aren't

213
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
Our assistance

214
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
Feeding a set of formation at the right time

215
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
Meaning

216
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:53,247
An extension of their existing notification capability right now on your Echo

217
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,039
There are notifications

218
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
Damn you make it your little

219
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:02,207
Make it a sound when somebody calls you you may see the light ring change a different color when your notifications

220
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,535
Then you have to ask and say met him a tell me my notifications

221
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
I thought just seems like an unnecessary step

222
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:12,191
Google home has limited notification support and again if you're not looking at the lights

223
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:17,567
You're going to miss a notification it supposed to like on your phone you'll get a buzz a beep and all that you pull out of your pond

224
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Mocking someone

225
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,895
That works on a phone notifications

226
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
Such as

227
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
Buzzing and beeping and all that

228
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:30,367
Our assistance have voice capabilities that seems to be a much better medium for me to get that information from the

229
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Those devices

230
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,439
That's what I'd like to see is eventually

231
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
These devices

232
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,375
Speak out loud say hey it's time to leave based on the traffic in the fact that you're going to work right now I saw that on your account

233
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,959
So that's one example I can come up with a hundred different examples but

234
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,263
The question is do people want

235
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
Proactive

236
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,359
Voice notifications should are smart

237
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,431
Speakers speak before being spoken to is the question

238
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
You know what it can

239
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,271
I was just out of it so we'll get into this but

240
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
The Nest doorbell

241
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
Which I installed

242
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
Actually gives you an option

243
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
You're going to love this

244
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
If I'm using

245
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
The face detect

246
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
Is my doorbell rings

247
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,631
I have the option of turning on a setting that says notify me

248
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
The nautical

249
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
All devices

250
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
So it will notify me on my

251
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,519
Home that somebody that my doorbell is ringing

252
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
In addition to the chine

253
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,591
Right what's even cooler is

254
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
Is it recognizes

255
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
The person's face

256
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
It will just say

257
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Stacy's home

258
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,271
Exactly I knew they had that feature and

259
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,111
I think it's awesome that's a perfect example of the value right there

260
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
Okay yes and I see this too and so

261
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
This brings me to

262
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
Epicenter recommended listening

263
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
Is sleet

264
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,375
Future tense so will oremus did a podcast

265
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,447
Cast without Lindsey who's the chief of Amazon's

266
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
Voice assistant

267
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,543
And they talked about what Madame a here's a took

268
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
Laughing

269
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
It was really interesting is

270
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,967
Will like Kevin and I really wants more context because that's going to make

271
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
Madame is life a little bit easier

272
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
But we're in in

273
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
Allen's he's all for it

274
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
He says that

275
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
The big challenge is how do we make

276
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
Madam

277
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
Contextually

278
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
They say they're doing this initially

279
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
Bye

280
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,887
Having devices listen so it can determine who's closest

281
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Figuring out if

282
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
When you ask her to stop

283
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
Do they want you to stop music or the

284
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
The video that's on your fire

285
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,567
So they've worked on those and saw that

286
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,431
The idea of kind of gathering ambient information about your environment

287
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,247
Willing that back to the echo that's not have

288
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
But he does think

289
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
That's how we're

290
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,183
And if for people who don't want that I hope it it's configurable

291
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
So that way you can

292
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:46,303
Yeah you can disable those type of notifications I realize that not everybody wants that

293
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,143
And there are other pieces of the puzzle that need to be in place such as presence detection

294
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,191
Like if it's time for me to leave for work

295
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:58,591
The echo next to my wife downstairs in the living room while she's watching TV shouldn't say hey it's time to leave

296
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
For work

297
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
Yes

298
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,455
That is NC in those are the kind of features people will give up

299
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Privacy for

300
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
Think about

301
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,599
Think about how freaked out we worry about Gmail and it reading our email soon

302
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
Serving ads

303
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,231
That went away so fast because we have free email

304
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
And it's not just things like

305
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
Free it's things like

306
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,655
How many people get over the worries about Amazon listening to your conversations

307
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,191
Because the echo is such a

308
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Valuable device to them

309
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
By the way the

310
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Podcast has talked about

311
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
How the echo works so you can

312
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
Get a refresher course on

313
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,687
How it listens and triggers the Wayward and your privacy set

314
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
They are still the same

315
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,015
They changed I would have led with that

316
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
So yeah

317
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,855
I recommend you listen to this if you're a huge Echo user

318
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Will

319
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
Drop a note in the

320
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
Show notes for y'all

321
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,255
Let's talk about o

322
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
One of my favorite

323
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
I guess apps

324
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,143
From a while back stringify was bought by

325
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Comcast

326
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,471
In Comcast just this week said

327
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,031
Did they basically relaunch stringify

328
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,567
Are there users of their expected

329
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
And

330
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
Twitter Kevin Durant

331
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
Comcast subscribers

332
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
I used to be a stringify user

333
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,551
And Comcast is basically created all of these they call them flows

334
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,855
What is a recipe on automation

335
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,671
Comcast is gone in and created all these flows for

336
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
People so they don't

337
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
In themselves

338
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
It's awesome

339
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
So there's a movie night float

340
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,351
For example that says when I ask Madame age to rent movie night

341
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,911
Set the brightness on my living room light.

342
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
10%

343
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
Pause my son's iPad

344
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
Change the channel to Starz kids and family

345
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
Do that for me would be family

346
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,639
So none of the flows are is, they're usually about

347
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
For devices

348
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
They're not as complicated as

349
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
I used to try to do

350
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,087
But if I was a mess because making a flow with so hard

351
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,903
And having all these pre-configured for you is actually real

352
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
So yeah

353
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,279
Totally agree and again neither you nor I have

354
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,071
Comcast for

355
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,655
Video provider a lot of what they're doing with stringify

356
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:02,751
Tying into the Xfinity X1 video platform so

357
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,799
Well you may be a stringify user

358
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:11,199
You may not have access to everything it can offer if you're not a Comcast X1 subscriber so

359
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
Yes now as a

360
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,039
I recommend so stringify

361
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
Competes most closely with yonomi

362
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
Which is a

363
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,207
You know he's a little bit easier to use and they're they're both going in the same

364
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Direction care so

365
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,535
Load one or the other

366
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
In start playing around with

367
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Famous the best way I

368
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
I can tell you to

369
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
Are both free

370
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,471
Comcast still lets people who are not Comcast customers used

371
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
By the way they also added

372
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:40,383
Lutron support So now that got support for casetta lighting Serena shades

373
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
And the carrier

374
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
Cor thermostats

375
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
Yeah there

376
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:52,415
And folks who use Android where they have a Android Wear watch out for the first time as well so you can easily one tap or what

377
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Voice control your scenes inflows

378
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
I will not be able to

379
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,607
And you shouldn't be able to on that small screen so

380
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
Those flows

381
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,007
They're really powerful that's the

382
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
It's kind of like the choice of

383
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
Really simple user interface Limited

384
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Keto options

385
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,687
Kind of more complicated you could do a lot more stuff

386
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
Okay speaking of watches

387
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
Let's talk

388
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,343
About something that people have noticed

389
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
The Apple watch

390
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
Is losing apps

391
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,767
Yeah and that's kind of why I said what I just said you shouldn't be able to set up

392
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,119
Smart home flow is on a watch because it just doesn't make sense on that screen

393
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
And yes people are getting a little

394
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
Worried about the Apple watch

395
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,519
A platform because now they saw Instagram

396
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,823
Is going away from the Apple watch

397
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,175
And other apps have gone away such as Twitter and slack and

398
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:50,527
Couple of others even Amazon I don't think they're going to be upset about as far as the

399
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,623
Because a lot of those apps really had no place on the small

400
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
Screen on your wrist

401
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
To begin with

402
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,767
I mean I'm not going to go to an Instagram if you don't know you know 1 and 1/4 inch

403
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,071
Screen Flip Flip Flip Flip and liking flipping foot

404
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,863
It just doesn't make sense

405
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,959
No not Twitter I mean anything with a long float

406
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,031
Certainly doesn't make sense to no notifications for those things

407
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:18,431
You can still do that without those apps because the way the Apple watch work says you can mirror the notifications from your phone

408
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
To your watch so

409
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
I don't have

410
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:26,367
The Facebook Messenger app on my Apple watch but when somebody

411
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:31,999
Messages me it creates a notification on my phone which is then creates a notification on my watch

412
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,327
Can I get a reply from the watch as a result of that you don't need the app

413
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,399
A lot of cases and notification still very actionable

414
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
Again Instagram

415
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
Do you want to get notified everytime somebody likes your photo on see that on your watch I can you could probably still do that but you don't need the answer

416
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
Give me a map to do anything

417
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
Now your rest if it just doesn't make sense

418
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
I don't

419
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,039
I don't think it's the right place for these apps to begin with

420
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
And that makes a

421
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
And so Kevin is not

422
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
And I think

423
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,719
Maybe if we get cool stuff like

424
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
The watch today

425
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Airpods

426
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,327
And having more voice cwise maybe that'll

427
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,911
Compensate for the screen so maybe having your

428
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Smart

429
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
Assistant be able to talk

430
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
Talk to you and me

431
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,799
More context oriented and notify maybe that make

432
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
For now

433
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
No

434
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
And we moved so much to the vision

435
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Get on

436
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
It's insane

437
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
I feel

438
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
When I surf

439
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
The internet today

440
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Maybe I should

441
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
I should tell you guys it's my birthday

442
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,463
Yay I just turned 40

443
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
So that might be

444
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
All right

445
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
Let's talk about

446
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
News

447
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
Okay

448
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Little bit

449
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
Lifx has new controls in feet

450
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,751
Yay August now works with SimpliSafe

451
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
FB

452
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,103
Smart home security company so your August lock integrates it now with that

453
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
And then Kevin has in x

454
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,223
Will stop my exploit but I'll report online

455
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:01,087
The other was an interesting article over in Wireless

456
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
We cry red

457
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:08,511
It's not what I thought it was going to be because the title is a long-awaited iot crisis is here and many devices aren't ready

458
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,327
So I assumed it was like IPv6 or something like that

459
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,911
New itsallaboutyou P&P

460
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
Which is universal

461
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Plug & Play

462
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
That's

463
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,871
I guess it's called a protocol that helps devices on a network find and

464
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
Work with other devices

465
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,479
Typically tan media streaming devices

466
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
Like if you want to

467
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
Use a Chromecast for example

468
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
That uses UPnP

469
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
To find

470
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
Other devices working get content from

471
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,487
So basically the exploit

472
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,607
It's something that Akamai researchers found and they said that there are about

473
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,911
4.8 million devices on the open internet

474
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,775
That would improperly return a certain query related to UPnP

475
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,847
And nearly a million of those

476
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,151
Another issue that would create

477
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,199
A network communication vulnerability

478
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,039
And they have a number of exploits that they've seen out of that as well

479
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,695
A lot of people turn UPnP off because it's not the most secure thing in the world is pretty open thing hey

480
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,279
I'm looking for devices on the network who's out there who can find me

481
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,351
So security standpoint it's not the best

482
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,167
Problem is certain devices require it

483
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,959
Such as a Google Chromecast

484
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,031
Even a Google home because that's how Google home finds

485
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,335
Devices such as other Chromecast so

486
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
I'm not suggesting that

487
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,687
Your Google home isn't secure or anything like that but

488
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,527
It does kind of make me wonder I'm trying to get turn around my head around

489
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,439
What the alternative is to UPnP for iot devices in home assistance in such so I don't know what that is yet

490
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
I don't know what

491
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,023
Everyone is using so

492
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,583
Not panic mode but this is something to be aware of

493
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,911
All right I know just who to call and ask so maybe I'll

494
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
Later this week

495
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
Video

496
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,775
All right that's enough news for now

497
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
Talk about

498
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,103
Should I go with things I've added or things I've done

499
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
Take

500
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,223
Let's go with me dumb cuz I'm really curious as to why you dumped this

501
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
Product plus I like to hear you say the product

502
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
Oh okay so

503
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,879
I was house cleaning I think I told you about myself

504
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Spring cleaning

505
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,719
And basically I have dumped my Ikea

506
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
Triad 3

507
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,023
Tradfri

508
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
How is it supposed to be

509
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
I think you said it correctly

510
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,631
Okay my Ikea tradfri

511
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,215
And I'm sorry Ikea I'm sorry

512
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,031
Worked really well

513
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,335
In their own little ecosystem of

514
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
Stuff to the hub

515
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,919
Two bulbs that I had

516
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
Incredibly well

517
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,735
They did not play well

518
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Madam

519
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
One I never actually got to

520
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
One worked

521
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
London

522
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,671
And then the one billboard wood

523
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
And one ball just

524
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:50,559
It would be recognized by as a device on Madame a but it would never actually be

525
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
Controlled BMI

526
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
My voice

527
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Except

528
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
What's so weird about it

529
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,471
Except when it was included in a routine

530
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
And that would work

531
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
That's odd

532
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
Isn't it crazy

533
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
I assume this is done through a skill

534
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,663
It is it's Ikea has a skill

535
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,759
And I will tell you guys that I deleted it off the echo

536
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,295
I deleted the skill

537
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,831
Alright disabled the skill

538
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
I uninstalled the app

539
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
I reinstalled

540
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
I redid the Gateway

541
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
I re-added every

542
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
Instilled

543
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
And going through the

544
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,840
Comments on the app

545
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,888
Apparently this is not an isolated incident

546
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,936
I found several things in Reddit about

547
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
This being

548
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
No problem

549
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
So

550
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:34,336
I just got sick of it it was my bedside table lamp in my husband's bedside table lamp

551
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
I laugh at this but

552
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,920
You know it was so nice to be able to say

553
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
Turn on Stacy

554
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
And poof

555
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
The Lamplighter

556
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
Turn off

557
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
Turn off

558
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
You know those are

559
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,440
Really nice use cases in my husband was just his it was his that didn't

560
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,512
Of course it was

561
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,816
So basically

562
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,864
I did it out of him it was like a mercy killing

563
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,680
So these are no longer in my home

564
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,472
No longer installed

565
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:05,568
I may try to give them away so we'll see if that because I give away later on

566
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,640
Take my broken iot devices

567
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
Broken

568
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,688
I know I

569
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,736
But yeah they don't work with Madam a

570
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
And I don't believe they work

571
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
With Google home

572
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,320
I don't believe so

573
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:21,952
That is where those stand I'm leaving them maybe Ikea will get its act together in this work but

574
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,488
Until then they're not installed

575
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
That is dumped

576
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
Alright well what did you ask

577
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
Oh you guys

578
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,168
You know that I love doorbells

579
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
Or if I have a love-hate relationship

580
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:36,032
So I had gotten a review unit of the nest

581
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Hello

582
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
And this doorbell

583
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
Is amazing

584
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
It is a very good

585
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
I don't know

586
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,480
It is on par with the ring Pro

587
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,784
In terms of the level of installation

588
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
And

589
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,368
The quality of the video

590
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,672
I think it loads a little bit faster

591
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:57,024
And then you have all these Integrations because I have a Google home and because I have a

592
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
Pixel 2 phone

593
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,632
This is definitely the doorbell I would choose for that type of setup

594
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
I also have a Chromecast

595
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
I have not

596
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Casted

597
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,544
To the Chromecast yet I'm actually in the next week I'm at

598
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,872
I'm going to come to you guys after having Google fi to my house

599
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
It's going to be fun

600
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
That's where we are right

601
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,344
I will be very curious how that works with your Chromecast only because my Nvidia Shield which is also my SmartThings

602
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
Tub

603
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,160
Has Google assistant and

604
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,952
When I'm watching TV

605
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,000
I would love to actually

606
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,536
Get a notification

607
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
Of

608
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,864
Somebody at the door and door

609
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
The video

610
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,168
Pop-up mode I don't think that's

611
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
An option right now but

612
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,288
I'm thinking ahead I would love to see that cuz all the tools are there just needs to be in

613
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,664
So we're going to see what happens when I Google fi and I also have the Yale lock

614
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,968
It's not installed on the same door

615
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
Where is the

616
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
Doorbell

617
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Because

618
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,320
The doorbells on my front door

619
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Front door is weird

620
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,928
So we're running some experiments to time how long it takes me to

621
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,768
It'll be able to remotely unlock the door so we'll tell you more about that but

622
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
The doorbell

623
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,072
$239

624
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
Install

625
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
Like the physical install

626
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,960
Pretty easy I think we talked about it last week

627
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,728
I did

628
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,776
Resolve the wiring issue

629
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:15,360
And that was mostly a Stacy's got weird wires kind of thing

630
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
In the end

631
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,176
Getting it connected

632
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
Was a challenge from my

633
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,248
Pixel 2

634
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,528
It was a snap

635
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
On the iPhone

636
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
That's weird

637
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
Yeah that was how I feel

638
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,208
It took me a couple customer support interactions and then

639
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
A reset

640
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
And it never connected

641
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,120
So I'm a little frustrated by that I find at the

642
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,192
Adding devices experiences always if your

643
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,240
On an Android device so

644
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,288
If you were able to connect your nest

645
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,824
Hello with an Android

646
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
Tell me how you did it

647
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
I spent

648
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,456
Probably three or four days trying to make that work

649
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
It's kind of longer than I

650
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
So those are my products

651
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
And now

652
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
What's answer somebody else's

653
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Question

654
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744

Suggest some to my favorites and some of Stacey's favorites and we're getting some really good suggestions in the comments

672
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,736
But I would love to have people call in and provide us some of your

673
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
More unique

674
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
Home automation routines

675
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,856
Yes super actually to do an episode that is all

00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
You guys

677
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,416
Your comments

678
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
Your automation

679
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
What's your question

680
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
So

681
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,536
Send them in

682
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,840
512-262-3742

683
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Okay

684
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,680
This week's question is from

685
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Derek

686
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,032
Hey Stacy Hey Kevin this is Derrick from California

687
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
My question is around smart home devices it appears that you know zigbee and Z-Wave are still kind of duking it out

688
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
I'm wondering

689
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
Is there a

690
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,528
Stand-alone hub

691
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,576
Or maybe a starter pack

692
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,112
You might recommend

693
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,416
Somebody to connect to their router

694
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:42,816
So that you know I don't have to worry about which protocol eventually you know when's the game so again just look

695
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,144
Looking for a way to break into it with maybe a

696
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,984
Mandation on your part thank you guys great show love it by

697
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
Oh Derek this is

698
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,104
Like you could have asked this question 5 years ago and you know what the answer still probably

699
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,128
The same

700
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,688
Pretty much mostly mostly the same

701
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
What's the Atari

702
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,736
So yes this is

703
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,528
Lady Eternal question

704
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
And iot

705
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,344
Your answer is

706
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Uniqlo

707
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,952
The best hubs we find 3 Kevin

708
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,744
I found we found

709
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,096
3 SmartThings support zigbee and Z-Wave as does wink

710
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,424
As does a router that you point it out to me

711
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
3

712
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,800
The almond 3 router by securifi

713
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
That actually

714
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,152
It's kind of an under-the-radar product but you can buy

715
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,432
This is both a

716
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,456
Smart home hub

717
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
It is a router

718
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,808
And it can actually act as a home security system with

719
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:39,136
The proper it to have a home security system options so you can have sensors and stuff

720
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,928
Talk to it

721
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
One of the routers is $150

722
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
3 cost

723
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560
$400

724
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
And

725
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,376
I tested these out actually there

726
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
Quite good

727
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,704
It's a good Hub it's a nice user interface

728
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,008
I don't know why more people don't have them

729
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,800
In all honesty because

730
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,104
I don't think people know about them as much

731
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,176
Yeah so that is out there and it's a mesh Wi-Fi router system

732
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
I don't know

733
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
So

734
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,904
And Derek if you're wondering why we didn't include the new Amazon Echo Plus which is an echo

735
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
A smart home hub in one

736
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,488
Because it only supports

737
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
WiFi Bluetooth n

738
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
Zigbee

739
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
Not Z-Wave

740
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Yes

741
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
All right

742
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
That is the answer to your question

743
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
Hits by a hub

744
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,592
I'm sorry that that is the answer to you

745
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Your question

746
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
It is what it is

747
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,480
Alright stay tuned you guys be

748
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,320
Because our guest this week puppy Crum is Avicii scientist

749
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,904
Dolby labs and she's going to talk about hearables

750
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:50,304
How we perceive music and what it means to give computers hearing

751
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,704
From The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is for truck and I have

752
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
Ben Goodman

753
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,824
VP of strategy and Innovation here at Fort Rock to talk to us

754
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,616
About ringing consent

755
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,896
To the edge

756
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Superman

757
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,712
Remind us first what it is

758
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,784
Active digital identity

759
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,088
We have a platform

760
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,904
Tools that allow us to do things like

761
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,952
Authentication and authorization

762
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,560
Manage user data and one of the things that's really exciting about our platform is

763
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:27,168
Is that we can take that platform and use it in ways that people didn't traditional music

764
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,728
So outside the Enterprise to the edge

765
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
And I think that's what we want to talk about here

766
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,848
So last week we did talk about this idea bringing consent to the edge

767
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,384
How do we do that

768
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,784
Generally speaking has really been about things that you do inside of your computer or your mobile device so it's been about

769
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,904
Authentication to a website or authentication to an application but more and more

770
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,928
Especially as

771
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
Taipei

772
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,256
Organizations are trying to compete with

773
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,048
Your native digital organization

774
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
It really is about

775
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
Instantiating all day

776
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,448
Controlling capability that I have on the web in the real world

777
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:04,288
And so what we believe is really important now is to take

778
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,360
The concepts of digital identity Weatherby Authentication

779
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,408
Or data protection or Access Control

780
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
Elections

781
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
Bring them down

782
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
To the physical world

783
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,040
What we've been doing is working with a lot of really interesting

784
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,832
Vendors like Armin

785
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
Samsung Intel

786
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,904
And making sure that we can take

787
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
All the capabilities

788
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,952
We have in the web

789
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
And bring it down

790
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,792
Into the real world answer some of that may be as simple as

791
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:31,424
Utilizing a trusted element or a trusted environment inside of a chipboard inside of the device at the edge

792
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,216
And actually making sure that

793
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,008
We can control the flow of

794
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,544
Personal information

795
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,336
As it goes to and from that device

796
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
It may mean around how we

797
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,920
Create secure channels and how would you ask

798
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,224
So what you really the key thing here

799
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,992
Is that

800
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,528
More and more people want a bridge

801
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
The physical world

802
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,344
And in order to do that

803
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,368
You need

804
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,392
Addition identity

805
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:57,792
And he destroyed any vendor that understands how to push that and that's something that has been focusing on really expensive

806
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,096
So what does that look like for the End customer

807
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,400
It's important that for the end

808
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,960
Customer they don't see this kind of jarring

809
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Separation

810
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,776
What happened to the physical world

811
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,848
You seem very organic and so

812
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,640
What that means is that behind the scene

813
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,408
We have to

814
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,200
Create an identity for a thing

815
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,528
And manage relationships with it just like we would manage relationships

816
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,808
Between two people and

817
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,368
Give them the end-user levers

818
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,208
That makes sense to them about how they share data just like they would share data with

819
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,024
And so I think it's very easy if we say that I'm hey

820
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,352
You know in order for me to personalize this hotel room for you

821
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,888
You're going to have to share a certain

822
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,984
And make those very clear concise and

823
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,288
We provide the plumbing that allows that to happen

824
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,336
But it's still the responsibility

825
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,152
Of the vendor that wants to provide this personalized

826
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:49,248
Make sure that they're surfacing that in a really user-friendly way

827
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,552
Alright where can we go to learn more

828
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,344
Please look at our website

829
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,392
4j.com where we have

830
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,976
A ton of information on privacy and really interesting things that are cost

831
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:04,352
Dealing with it and specifically checkout.com privacy

832
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,824
Hey everybody Welcome Back To The Internet of Things

833
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,872
This is your house Stacey Higginbotham

834
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:20,224
And today's guest is Poppy Crum who is the chief scientist at

835
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
Toby

836
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
She is talking to us at South by Southwest

837
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,320
Just part of the IEEE.

838
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
Hack for Humanity

839
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,648
So hi Papi how are you

840
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416
Feisty

841
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:34,560
I am super excited because you work on something that I am super passionate about which is curable

842
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
Because I think this is

843
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,376
Perfect example where like

844
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
Technology advancement

845
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,192
Meets actual

846
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Better

847
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,032
So let's get right into the fact that

848
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,104
I am super optimistic about hearing aids incurables

849
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,128
How do you feel about this

850
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:55,040
I really think that you're is going to be a transformational place with regard to both Ai and the

851
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:01,440
When did reality Hub in the future there's so much information and learning about an individual that happens in your ear we can

852
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
Talk about that

853
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,256
But there's this also

854
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,560
Lot of movement that's happening

855
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,864
In this space right now

856
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,400
We're seeing huge converge

857
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
Between entertainment

858
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,216
Lifestyle

859
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
And

860
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,752
Hearing health

861
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,288
I'm a True Believer that

862
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,104
Our Technologies are only going to be as good as we

863
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,176
Can get them too if we have personalized devices

864
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,480
Annie really becomes this amazing

865
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,504
Hub at

866
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,528
Information

867
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Between

868
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,856
Individual and the external world

869
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:36,512
To really think about how we optimize our experiences and make these devices and enabler iot devices to be

870
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,072
What I would call an extension of our agency

871
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,888
Wow that was super deep okay you brought up

872
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,960
The whole bunch of stuff for me so we're going to break some of this down

873
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,984
Cuz I was thinking

874
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,128
Hey hearables their medical devices but then when you talk about AR and BR in like oh my gosh in at Dolby I'm like

875
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
Peasant immersive experience

876
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,504
Is false breakdowns for me should I be thinking of hearing just

877
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,552
Bradley and we should apply it everywhere

878
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,832
That's a great question

879
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,856
I think there's a lot of waste

880
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
I tried to break it down

881
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,976
Where is a device in my ear might actually be able to enhance

882
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
My life or ways we even use them

883
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
You can separate and let's start

884
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,424
With the way we're already people are already using hearables might be as assistants I think that's a pretty

885
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,216
Ubiquitous use that showing up

886
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,776
Are you can talk about hearable both as a static character

887
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,800
What's the price of an Amazon Echo

888
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,592
Go home or a wearable device

889
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:28,224
We should listen we talked about the wearables right now as an assistant you've got something intersecting other app

890
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
Applications

891
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
Ways of

892
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,576
Causing things to happen in my world that I'm actually

893
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
Requesting

894
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,648
In your ear you've also got information

895
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,464
It can pick up on you've got within their system

896
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,024
Really rich set of biological signals

897
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,352
That having sensors and that one particular place in your body

898
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
Tiny

899
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,680
Certify call it will dime-sized patch you can pick up

900
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
Up your heart rate

901
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,032
You can pick up the electroencephalogram pick up EEG you can pick up

902
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
Blood oxygenation

903
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:57,664
Your galvanic skin response

904
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
Internal information about

905
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
Kathy is our state

906
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,760
So how do we use that to sing

907
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,320
But you've also got the devices

908
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,600
It's listening to your environment

909
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
So now you got it for

910
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,976
Coming in and information about you whether it's for your voice or through

911
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,280
Reading information about your state that's going out

912
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,120
And that interplay is I think will really important part of the future

913
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:21,216
Wow I didn't realize you could get all that for my ear so that's actually go bad

914
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,752
And talk about yours for a second

915
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,056
And hearing and all the information like

916
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:30,944
Maybe it's not as simple as how it works but if I'm thinking about taking information what does information that's

917
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,736
Good to get from

918
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,832
My eardrum and what makes sense to

919
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,856
Happen it

920
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,136
In your device

921
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,744
Great questions and if we look back five years things have really evolved

922
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:49,120
That's why the way we might have described him Taken 2 years ago different than how I'm talking about them

923
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Today

924
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:56,288
We are in the last few years people have been able to in a lab and you're just with your sensors capture

925
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,824
Picking up and decoding

926
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
My attention

927
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,152
Attentional my cot where it's being directed

928
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
The Who

929
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
The what

930
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,224
Aware

931
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,064
And you end up with these inferences happening in a lab might be

932
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,464
Somewhat noisy but suddenly you pair that with environmental intelligence and contacts I know I'm at a restaurant

933
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,256
Because the device can tell or I know I'm

934
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:22,400
I got certain stalkers I'm trying yo that are in my social network in my device knows that it knows who those people I care about are

935
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,704
Answers and start painting this really rich

936
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
Picture that's going to ask

937
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
Actually

938
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:32,896
Truly enhance my experience and not just be feeding me again that you have a text message to go check your email

939
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,968
So I can literally mute people

940
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
Don't we all

941
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
Completely possible that your device in

942
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:49,024
Getting out of the lab is one thing that we're really moving towards that your device would allow you to have

943
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,816
One conversation listen to another

944
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,584
Multitask

945
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:56,448
Let's do that in a effective way but it's a can make you more social again it

946
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,728
We already do that

947
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,800
In our attention at the cocktail party solving that kind of

948
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Problem

949
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,432
You're aware I'm in a noisy environment and how do I make sense of my

950
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,968
Acoustic environment

951
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:12,064
Someone who has hearing lots of fun of hardest problems in for someone that doesn't have her

952
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,368
Hearing loss that's still a hard problem

953
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:18,976
Let me go to a restaurant that's popular it's really noisy and it's something that

954
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
Greatly impacts

955
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
Our social club

956
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,792
Communication

957
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,864
So what we want our devices that enable us to

958
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
Better communication with

959
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,496
Each other without us having to break that conversation and go you know

960
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,288
Turn up the cell phone or

961
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:37,152
Intersected and police things that you want your device to know so what am I device that can pick up one on my cock.

962
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:43,808
That's a fairly robust thing that we can track quite easily it can tell if my brains having to work harder and it responds

963
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,368
How do we change that technological Lube

964
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
Because you've got

965
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,440
You've got these different devices you got

966
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
Information about me

967
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:56,352
These things that are happening in the world of AI and machine learning are we becoming much more intelligent

968
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
2

969
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,144
The environment

970
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,472
You're in the military they call that situational awareness and

971
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,008
When you think about what

972
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,104
My situational awareness for my contacts that's really relevant

973
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
To my devices

974
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
Sing to me

975
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,944
I want my devices optimizing

976
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,736
Their signal processing

977
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:18,112
And their capabilities to be intelligent to that without my having to intervene

978
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,184
Type of intersection and so that's what we're really starting

979
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,584
To see in especially in development especially in sort of what I would call bleeding edge Technologies for hearing aids as well

980
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:34,240
Okay so you're actually talking about customization both to my hearing level and then also to whatever environment I'm in

981
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,288
Has a lot of computational

982
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,312
Power so

983
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,104
Or it feels like it should be a lot of come

984
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,152
Computational power so what is happening

985
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,200
Justin the physical Hardware side

986
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,736
It's making this pause

987
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Football today

988
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,064
I think there's really a beautiful Resurgence in Seoul

989
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,344
Working development that's happening

990
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,648
If you look at the let's just talk

991
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
Carrying out front

992
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,232
Because the richness of what's going to happen

993
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,304
Or needs to happen to truly make a hearable device

994
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,608
A significant one that we all

995
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,632
Benefit from

996
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:06,496
Is Convergence of both entertainment and lifestyle and this hearing Health space

997
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,032
Sharing Health space UCI

998
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
A lot of

999
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,080
Hearing aids in

1000
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:14,944
Make use of the same so I can make use of the same signal processing and it's really quite

1001
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,968
Constrained but

1002
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,248
In order to get

1003
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,272
A lot of this

1004
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:22,368
More advanced machine-learning nuts and things that are going

1005
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,184
To enable more intelligent experiences

1006
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,744
The Silicon development has really started

1007
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,584
There's been a big Resurgence in that development to be able to miniaturize computation

1008
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
In Tucson

1009
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,632
Into a small enough

1010
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Form factor for hairball

1011
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,704
Now form factor is a huge

1012
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
Yeah you look at it

1013
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,032
Hearing aids they really haven't changed much at all

1014
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,568
And there's a big stigma

1015
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,104
Associated with some of the

1016
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,896
Four factors that currently exist Things Are

1017
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,176
Behind the ear

1018
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:50,272
Come with a medical branding on them they say you're old

1019
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296
And people hate that

1020
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:54,880
What I see that's really wonderful about how things are going to transform music

1021
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,928
Everybody's wearing horrible to destigmatize is it

1022
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,952
For everyone because

1023
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,536
Unlike Vision where people might say not wearing glasses you

1024
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,096
You have a muscular a muscle benefit sometimes and

1025
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,656
And I would question that but there are reasons with the

1026
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:10,240
Case of hearing if you actually don't innovate your hearing

1027
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:15,872
If you have hearing loss and you aren't stimulating people wait to get here unless there's actually an increased deficit

1028
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,152
Neural deficit happens

1029
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,944
All through the pathway so there's this

1030
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
Very important

1031
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,784
Aspect of getting people to

1032
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,136
Not just preserve there. But actually intervene when you have hearing loss as soon as possible

1033
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,720
The reality is we all start having hearing loss when

1034
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
Dinner

1035
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,584
Early twenties and its mission

1036
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,448
Things from our environment exposure to noise ototoxicity aspirin soda toxic

1037
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,496
A lot of things we just

1038
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
Julian just

1039
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
Avatar

1040
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,104
Okay so my life is a rock critic

1041
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,408
In my college Years and

1042
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,736
My incredible ingestion of aspirin is causing me some eggs

1043
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
Now I'm like oh my gosh

1044
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
Okay but

1045
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,856
Let's go back to what it takes

1046
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,392
Before you freak me out more

1047
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,672
Too many tries this

1048
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:05,536
What is the ideal form factor do you think or what is a form factor we're working toward

1049
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,816
And then what

1050
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:11,680
Just be something we have everyday that we just wear and we listen to music and we

1051
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
Go talkin

1052
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,288
Pop it in when we're like of a certain age I mean what is this look like in the

1053
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,336
That's a great question.

1054
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,896
Because it's evolving and

1055
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
Think about it this way

1056
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,456
I don't like to

1057
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,040
To think that having hearing loss there was a statistic I came across 19% of

1058
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,320
12 to 17 year olds

1059
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,880
Already have some degree of noise-induced hearing

1060
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,464
And that's a pretty terrifying statistic but

1061
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,000
Movie think about hearables

1062
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,792
I really do feel

1063
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,840
We don't want to talk about it with regard to hearing

1064
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,400
We want to talk about it disregard

1065
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
Personalization

1066
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,008
And how do we we all have our physiological systems are all differ

1067
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:47,776
Environment

1068
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,895
Irrelevancies and sensitivities that are environments demand of us are differ

1069
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:59,295
So we went processing that is capable to adjust to that and learn those needs of us

1070
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,831
With regard to a form fact

1071
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,879
That's a really fun question because

1072
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,439
They're a lot different ways you can go and things you're seeing happening

1073
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,743
There's no question a small device is interest

1074
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
If you look at it

1075
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:12,095
Where are the Haribo company's are right now it really is it runs the gamut

1076
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,143
Let's it's a hugely heterogeneous in terms of form

1077
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,167
Talking about devices

1078
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,215
Like your go who are trying to be assertive

1079
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:21,311
Disruptive I love their form-factor they're sort of a disruptive they still considered

1080
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:27,711
Call themselves the hearing aid but therein are almost entirely hidden from the world there's nothing that goes off

1081
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,503
Warrior versus a company

1082
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
There's a Hero

1083
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,039
Human

1084
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,087
But has he started Elston

1085
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,111
Devices that fit

1086
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,695
Completely over here which I also think is beautiful you're trying to

1087
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:42,303
Create a very different in both cases a different landscape than what

1088
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,607
Historical hearing aid

1089
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
Fourth doctor

1090
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
Whip It

1091
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,935
You'll have a lot of devices like

1092
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
Like nuheara

1093
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,751
Former Doppler where you have

1094
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,543
A near device but it's

1095
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,847
Wanting to point out here is it's fully exclusive

1096
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,639
And everything you hear from the world

1097
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,175
Is Electro acoustic layer

1098
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:58,943
Representative

1099
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:04,063
Which is just some level of philosophical conundrum I'd like to think of it

1100
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:09,439
So instead of the analog signals we're getting the digital interpretation of the analog signals

1101
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
Precisely

1102
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,511
And we can do that pretty well

1103
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:16,863
But it's a funny thing so it to me and this is my personal belief that

1104
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,959
Ideal form factor something that leverages our natural physiological capabilities and then

1105
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
Gives us things on top of

1106
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,543
Rather than just recreate it so it because

1107
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:31,199
You think about going to wander the world if I would you wear a VR device if I tell you everything you're going to experience is

1108
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,503
Entirely an accurate representation of the world

1109
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,063
I will be able to give you more but you're still it's all going to be sent

1110
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,879
Did you go out for the rest of your life doing nothing

1111
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,159
No I would not

1112
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:44,511
Which gets to this idea of perception and you've done a lot of Standards work around the concept of

1113
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,071
So let's talk about

1114
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,119
Let's talk about your philosophy there actually that

1115
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:55,519
So in this case you're talking about letting someone else mediate how you experience the world but you also work

1116
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,615
And standards efforts to establish baselines for how people

1117
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
A different

1118
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,431
Levels experience the world correct

1119
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:08,063
So my background I'm a neurophysiologist by training but also I've been in the technology space for quite some time

1120
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,343
I really

1121
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,903
Like to think that I spend my time trying to identify

1122
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,671
Anafi

1123
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,231
Ways our technology is going to best intersex

1124
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:15,999
With

1125
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:20,607
Austin's depending on both an understanding of our biology but also a

1126
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:26,239
Are perceptual realities we each experience the world and very unique ways some of those we can track some of those

1127
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,031
We haven't been able to but

1128
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,871
And we're learning more about how we can actually objectify what someone's XP

1129
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,919
Prancing and use that to informed

1130
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,943
Technology

1131
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,991
No I'd like to say we're building

1132
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,527
Technologies that are

1133
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,879
The way they intersect with us it feels like a true extension of our agency

1134
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:46,207
And not the technology telling us what we have to expect

1135
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,743
Answer what we are going to do

1136
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,767
Anticipating

1137
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
How

1138
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
Yep we would naturally

1139
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:56,703
For me the world going at every moment is and this is I think

1140
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
We are thinking about

1141
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,055
Things now it's a probabilistic

1142
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
Experience

1143
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,151
And many features come together

1144
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
To determine

1145
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:10,271
How we experience how we each differentially experience perhaps the same

1146
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,039
Piece of

1147
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,575
Cremation your and UK

1148
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,879
Can probabilistically model those things weather

1149
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
I go back

1150
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,303
20 years I spent a lot of time thinking about probabilistic inference for how we experience auditory and visual information to four

1151
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,607
Where it is

1152
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,887
When it happens and

1153
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,215
You can develop very intelligent models at this

1154
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,519
But now you get into this

1155
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,055
Transition where

1156
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,335
The device

1157
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,359
Needs to

1158
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,383
Understand those

1159
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,967
Perceptual reality cuz if ice is going to have a lot more information then

1160
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
We ever experienced

1161
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,271
We don't Xperia

1162
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:48,159
And having a device tell us things in the wrong place or intersect Us in the wrong place that isn't consistent with that

1163
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,463
Is jarring and actually think will make us less if

1164
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,255
So it's how do we

1165
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
Bridge that Gap

1166
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:57,631
So it's like we've been doing a lot of work we read a lot about computer vision

1167
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,191
This is kind of computer hearing and understanding

1168
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,775
What different things mean to a person when we're actually perceiving

1169
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,103
So I always know that if I hear a car in my

1170
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
Like behind me

1171
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,199
I always look in check and I know exactly where that car is based

1172
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,527
A computer may not have that sense until we program it

1173
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
Is that kind of close

1174
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,879
Yes on some level

1175
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,903
Computer hearing

1176
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
Is very relevant

1177
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,463
But it's more than

1178
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,999
Write it needs

1179
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,023
There's information

1180
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,047
What it tells you

1181
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,583
How it informs

1182
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,167
How it makes use of that information so something as simple as I want to

1183
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:37,567
Inform you that their car right behind you there's other things I have to get right because now I've got to create binaural represent

1184
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:40,895
Tatian maybe I got an inner tube I so I didn't synthetically

1185
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,175
If I'm

1186
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:46,271
Trying to do this and it say an inclusive environment at the synthetically recreate

1187
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,575
Information that informs you in the right way

1188
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
To make sure that you reacted

1189
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
That's indicative of

1190
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,439
What would be the most successful for you

1191
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,231
In fact that's a pretty tough problem

1192
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,279
In that case because I got a saint if I didn't

1193
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,303
Patient meaning

1194
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,863
I need to identify what's the best Q I could give you

1195
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,447
How to make sure that every single time you experienced that

1196
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,471
Or someone else does

1197
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,263
It's in the accurate location

1198
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,335
And that's something that the industry has not been able to get

1199
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
Cracked

1200
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,663
In the variance is based on what

1201
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,711
Are hearing loss over time or just

1202
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,039
Totem multitude of Futures because it one thing we each have

1203
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,087
Unique what I like to call cookie cutters

1204
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:24,415
Our bodies are at anthropometry of our ears or head

1205
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:30,815
Create a very unique filter of continuations and excitations across amplification Center

1206
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,119
Continuations across every frequency in sound in

1207
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,911
World that is unique

1208
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
Chimichurri sauce

1209
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,215
But we also have very unique

1210
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:40,031
Hearing patterns and different physiological

1211
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:44,639
Call changes that happen to our bodies and we also have them the context of information of the environment

1212
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,199
Those three pieces come together and no

1213
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
You have a knack

1214
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:52,831
Accurate representation right now what most of the world does what most of

1215
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,623
The technological space and

1216
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,927
Offering to the market do is assume

1217
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,695
We're all the same

1218
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,463
Wow

1219
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,767
I just learned a lot and

1220
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,559
Now I have a sense of

1221
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,327
Both house

1222
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,095
How hard it is

1223
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:04,863
To develop

1224
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,191
Reactive responsive hearing aids responsive

1225
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:11,519
I don't even know what we should call this we probably shouldn't call it Heroes what do you think

1226
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:15,871
I am happier with hearables in hearing aids for sure I'd like to say

1227
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,639
It's all about him

1228
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,175
We can

1229
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:18,943
Have assistance

1230
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
Enhancement

1231
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
We can

1232
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,039
Delivery information out

1233
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:26,623
Meaning understand our bodies and have a device that helps us

1234
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:33,023
Connect to our environment to make us more effective but it's how we bring information into in an effective way that it actually helps us

1235
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,839
Make our lives more augmented and enhanced

1236
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
Awesome alright

1237
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,191
When can I expect to see things like that are this cool

1238
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,983
Some of them are already coming out there

1239
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,263
I think there's

1240
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,311
Awesome thank you so much Poppy

1241
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:51,711
Thank you Stacey that's it for this week thanks so much for listening to remember if you'd like more iot

Sign up for my newsletter at Stacey on iot. Com

1243
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:02,463
Will see you next week
