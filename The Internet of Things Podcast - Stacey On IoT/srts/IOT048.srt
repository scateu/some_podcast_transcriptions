00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,032
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast I am your host

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,056
Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:13,824
And this is

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,592
Is your co-host

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,616
Kevin tofel

6
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,432
And today we have an awesome show for you

7
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:21,504
Cuz we've got a brand new Raspberry Pi

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,576
Stuff from Saudi

9
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,368
Ready to take on the Amazon Echo

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:30,720
I don't know if that's a gay or boo I was waiting for Kevin I'm on the fence

11
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:31,744
All right

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
Wechat

13
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,536
Cheaper watches

14
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,304
And do watch

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
We've got

16
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,656
Update from last week because we didn't talk about

17
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,192
New developments in the stand

18
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
Community

19
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:47,360
And I guess this week is Chad Curry who is the managing director for the center of real estate technology at the Nash

20
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,640
National Association of Realtors

21
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,688
You got it

22
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,968
Bringing smart houses

23
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,064
And I'm really curious to hear the interview because

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,088
Cos

25
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,160
That's a lot of opportunity for iot type

26
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,720
Connected devices in the home real estate market

27
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,280
I'm finding more and more Realtors I talk to

28
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,816
Are really getting into this thing

29
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,960
Okay so let's get this party started with the raspberry

30
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Reply

31
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,032
Always room for pie

32
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,848
So latest and greatest in this is like only a few

33
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
Months

34
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,664
Jax Ali like 2 months

35
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,712
That node 3 months

36
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,480
Because it came out

37
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272
November

38
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,088
The pi zero this is a better equipped by this is

39
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
And it has

40
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,952
Integrated thank you

41
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Bluetooth

42
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,256
On board

43
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,536
So everyone's like this

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,352
Raspberry Pi for The Internet of Things

45
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:46,496
Yep yep yep this is nice because I don't believe the previous pies had integrated connectivity

46
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,824
I could always do add-ons look forward to things like that

47
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,200
They're doing this at the same price for the Raspberry Pi 2 which you can still get for $35 but

48
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,224
Why would you

49
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,784
Cuz for $35 you can get a faster chip

50
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
It's a 1.2 gigahertz

51
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
64-bit

52
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
Quad core

53
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,256
Other thing is 10 times the performance of the original Raspberry Pi which the make sense

54
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
It's been 4 years now

55
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
Debut that

56
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
It's the first six

57
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,912
64-bit Raspberry Pi

58
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,240
Which is Big because you can turn this into like a little mini server

59
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:25,408
Yep yep that one of the things I like that they did over the Raspberry Pi so it's it's fully compatible with the original

60
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,808
Pies and all the accessories in such all the try to keep all the pins in the same spot I think they only move like one LED

61
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
D indicator

62
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,416
Unisex he's got like add-on boards from the older pies

63
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,256
You should still be able to use them with the Raspberry Pi 3

64
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
Oh that's nice so I was

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,888
It's still good feel good exact

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,728
Exactly so I think it's still broadcom empowering this right

67
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,288
It is still a broadcom chip there still

68
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
Stay in bed with broadcom

69
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Hey now

70
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
I don't know where that came from

71
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
That wasn't supposed to be anything

72
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
Negative

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,344
But you can't unlike would like the Arduino are other

74
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,928
Things you cannot buy the chips that powers the pie separate

75
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
So that's something worth noting

76
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,536
Because you could buy the other chips that are the brains behind

77
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,120
Like Arduino or any of those others you can buy those separately but not with

78
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,680
And if you have kids I should tell you

79
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,752
That Cato the the computer for kids

80
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
I should say that I

81
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
Put together as my daughter and love so much

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
They actually have something

83
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
They have a new computer coming out soon

84
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
It will work with this

85
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
Pi

86
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
And

87
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,576
They're going to be available for pre-order for one night

88
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
149

89
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
It won't ship till June

90
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
But if you want

91
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,232
You can buy this version of the pie

92
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
And you can just download the

93
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
Pokeno software on it today

94
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
Inner work

95
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
And I only say that because I really liked the

96
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
Aquino and I thought it was a really cool

97
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,264
OS and system for teaching

98
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
My nine-year-old about like

99
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,176
Parts of a computer and here's how to like program your own stuff in Minecraft which she was

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Yeah

101
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
A software perspective

102
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,576
Just in case people are interested you can still use all the old

103
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
Software the raspbian

104
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
Pi

105
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
Suffer image

106
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,744
They are still keeping that same 32-bit software but they're going to consider

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,047
Making that a 64-bit

108
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,839
Operating system in the future

109
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,375
Because you know I'm in

110
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,679
You got the hardware that can support it so maybe it makes sense

111
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
Okay so on the

112
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Next topic

113
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
Sony

114
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
And it's

115
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
New Amazon Echo

116
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
Tell us a little bit about

117
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:37,503
Yeah this is an interesting prototype device that Sony debuted at Mobile World Congress last week it's called the Xperia

118
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Agent

119
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,575
Not yet for sale and they don't have any

120
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,879
Potential dates running like that they were showing it off

121
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,951
Is very similar to an Amazon Echo it looks

122
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,255
Have a similar form factor although it's more

123
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,351
It's not supposed cylindrical against tapered at the top and that's because they have this

124
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,447
Rotating ball that actually has a camera in it and a projector

125
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
So unlike the echo

126
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
It can actually project information

127
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,383
So that you know if you ask questions about maybe the stock market I could just show you

128
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
The stock market numbers at the time or something it's a small projector made it a little it looks like it's projecting maybe a 2in

129
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,879
Square down on a tabletop it's going to work through voice

130
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,975
So just like the Equitable control it asked questions just like any personal assistant

131
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,535
I'll search through gestures because it has a camera

132
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583
They haven't really explained what those gestures

133
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
Would be what

134
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
You adieu

135
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
People also

136
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
Potentially they said be tied to your smartphone

137
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,775
So that way using your smartphone for information

138
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Presence

139
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
When you walk into a room

140
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,687
It would see you get information on you and literally set the room up in a scene that

141
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,711
Is custom to you

142
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,295
Turn certain lights on perhaps turn music on to a certain station

143
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
And so on

144
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
It's like jam packed with sensors

145
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
And have a lot of

146
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,463
Potential but it is still just a prototype at this point

147
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,815
OC that seems really very close to prototypes I've seen from like

148
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
Almost a decade ago

149
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,447
I'm really excited about this

150
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,263
The concept i think was frogdesign had something called

151
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
The room

152
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
And it had a projector it had cameras

153
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,639
I think it used modified connect

154
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Is actually

155
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
And

156
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
You would gesture

157
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,783
And it would turn on lights if you gesture to a light

158
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,647
Or if you set you know lights on it would turn whatever you were gesturing at on for example

159
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
And if you were

160
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,487
Looking at used also like

161
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,095
It's image recognition to understand if you were looking at it so if you were addressing

162
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,703
The device is opposed to another person to ask it a question so you never had to do anything like

163
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Funny wake words

164
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:41,151
It was really kind of cool but it was also super clunky and kind of like weird to set up but

165
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
The other cool thing about the camera was

166
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,807
Then you could interact with what was projected on the screen because the camera could see what you were

167
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
Interacting with

168
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855
Which is really kind of fun

169
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
I like the surface table

170
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
That sounds cool

171
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,535
Again they the projections really small so I don't at least at this point

172
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
Smalls I don't know if

173
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,655
You be able to interact with it or anything I think it's more Just for information and

174
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
I like the idea that

175
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,007
As much as I like the idea of gestures as well

176
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:12,383
I personally prefer voice control over gestures any day of the week and I found that out

177
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,687
Long-term using my Xbox Kinect

178
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,503
I voice control the thing all the time

179
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
I could do dressers for things but I tend not to

180
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,623
It's his voice always seems easier to me

181
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,927
I think it depends on what kind of what you're doing

182
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:30,047
Voice is great when your hands are full but you do have to think a lot more like I found when I

183
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
Controlling the echo

184
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,143
I often give it the wrong command cuz I've got

185
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
Five different lighting commands

186
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
SportZone Lake

187
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
Oh I'll be in

188
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
In one of them

189
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
Suunto turn on

190
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Running rampant

191
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,687
You know what then she's like what are you talkin

192
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,271
Yep in a situation where I was like he just turn on the lights

193
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:55,135
And then I was gesturing and both of those things could be put together to turn up what I wanted on

194
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Because I'm not.

195
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Articulate

196
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
That would be really nice

197
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,511
It's tough but you know what

198
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,351
It would also help if the natural language processing word prove which

199
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
It is

200
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:10,495
So that way you can be a little more vague I mean obviously I can give it the wrong like a turn-on that's

201
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
That's exactly what's going to happen

202
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,567
That's user error

203
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
So we call user error in the industry

204
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
But you're right there certain

205
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
Phrases that have a very

206
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Particularly

207
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
Spoken

208
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,807
Especially like stay with it the triggers and skills that

209
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,343
The echo is using these days

210
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,999
So yeah I'd like to see more freedom in an improvement there

211
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
Of this weird

212
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,119
Isolation is perspective I feel like

213
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
The people who design

214
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,727
The smart home scenarios must like not live with people

215
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
Because

216
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:49,407
Music and do whatever you want

217
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
Okay

218
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,247
How many people actually walk into their like

219
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
House like their actual home

220
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
And

221
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Live alone

222
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,183
And don't have other people to contend with when these things are happy

223
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,743
Cuz if I walked in and like my music played

224
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,303
I guarantee you that my husband would be like

225
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
Oh my God why is this

226
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
Who are you Stacy in the Royal we

227
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
The program

228
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
The house

229
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,495
Yeah that's that's definitely a good point I think it's

230
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
Set plates interesting is it practical

231
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
For a lot of people know

232
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
Exactly I'm just imagining my 9-year

233
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
Run music

234
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
We'd all be like

235
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Jamming down

236
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
Calvin Harris

237
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Stats Hood

238
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Calvin Harrison

239
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
Okay so

240
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
Cool things SoDo pricing

241
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Prototype

242
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
Still a concept

243
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
So much stuff

244
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,263
Sony doesn't sell cheap stuff so right off the bat I would agree

245
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
Okay well we'll look for

246
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
Things like this I imagine many people out

247
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,271
Maybe not many but some of y'all out there probably built similar things feel free to tell us about it because I'm kind of curious

248
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,319
Thoughts on speakers it's a big

249
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
Fun topic

250
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Next topic

251
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
Fitbit has a new watch out

252
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
The Fitbit Blaze

253
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
Did Market udderly

254
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
Fidget

255
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
Is shipping now

256
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
And I don't have one

257
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
I don't know

258
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
I think my next like

259
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
Wearable

260
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,031
Is going to be something that has my heart rate

261
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
And

262
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
I don't dyslexia

263
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
Pure pulse heart rate

264
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,015
I just I feel like $200

265
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
It is a lot of minister

266
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:38,975
What color the flagship device it's got a totally different design and their prior devices that looks more like a regular watch

267
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,583
I didn't want to say that but yet it does what it it's

268
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
What did you with the corners cut off

269
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
Also it's Sino octagonal and

270
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,239
But it has it looks more like a traditional watch than their prior

271
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
Products which look like tracking devices

272
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
So

273
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,711
You know it's our Flagship and it does everything that I think most people would want like you said it's at the heart rate monitor

274
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
It does include

275
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,063
Call and text notifications and calendar alerts so that has

276
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
A little bit of

277
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
Smart watching is to it

278
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,975
You can record running cycling cross training Etc attraction

279
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,303
Steps to distance calories floors climb Auto sleep

280
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
Got a 5-day battery life

281
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
It's nice

282
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
I will say it's nice

283
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
I actually just bought something different

284
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
For about the same price

285
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,103
That is all the same stuff plus electric store and play Wireless music on

286
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,687
Do what you buy the TomTom cardio

287
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
Plus music device

288
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,599
It was serious like $25 more than this and it was actually a

289
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,183
On sale so you would probably spend more I would have paid full retail

290
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,535
But I'm very happy with it and it's great for everything we just said

291
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,375
Plus I have forgiven stores to put music on and go running

292
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,447
With the GPS in the heart rate monitor that's built into it and

293
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,983
And listen music at the same time

294
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
Remember that

295
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
We're going to get to music

296
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Just a minute

297
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
Okay

298
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
But first we should tell you also in Smartwatch news

299
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
I'm thinking about it

300
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
Smartwatch news

301
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
Pebble time has actually lowered

302
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
Racing

303
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Yay

304
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,207
Yeah that was actually the extended on I believe

305
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
2

306
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
Devices the time and the time round

307
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Time in the time

308
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Timer on but the time still stays

309
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Okay

310
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
Haircut

311
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,215
Cuz it around versions of the Pebbles have been out that long

312
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,775
No they haven't which makes me wonder how are they

313
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Just not said

314
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,639
I do not know I haven't seen sales figures

315
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
So War

316
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,991
I think last I heard they had over million sales as of

317
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:41,343
Oh I don't recall when it was but I haven't heard any numbers in a while it's well say

318
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
So the time

319
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
Is 149 99

320
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
In-N-Out on round 1 round

321
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
Is 199

322
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
It's $200

323
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
Who's got a $50 price

324
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
Cuz I was just too much

325
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
29

326
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
I'm just going around

327
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
In the time steel is still 200

328
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,895
Yeah I actually had a pebble time

329
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,991
That I sold to somebody at a discount because I wasn't using it

330
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:13,599
Part of me says that maybe I should have done that because they did add some help features back in December

331
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:18,463
And you know it's using some sensors to track things like sleep and activity and whatnot

332
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
It just wasn't granular enough

333
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
For me to

334
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
Be that desirable

335
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:27,423
You know. Dedicated Fitness tracker with heart rate monitor that's kind of where I was going

336
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
So I have my ancient first pebble

337
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
I loved

338
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Because it was

339
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,151
It did exactly what I needed it to do and I still wear like my one-off tiny little tracker

340
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,455
And I've stopped kind of wearing it

341
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
Because I tend to wear my ring

342
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,855
My ring late now and I need to notifications and

343
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,463
I also carry my phone more places but I'm wondering if the weather gets warmer and I start ditching

344
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:55,071
My phone cuz I'm not wearing pockets as often if I'll strap it if I'll be

345
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
I need upgrade my SmartWatch

346
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
I could be

347
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
I could be

348
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,495
Even though you had the older pebble

349
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:09,151
I think in and you can correct me if you know I think you got the time interface that they launched last year

350
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,223
I did as a software update

351
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,527
Past present and future stuff

352
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
It was an interesting take on things

353
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
I like their interpretation

354
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
Changes not

355
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,439
I'm not one to be like

356
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,815
But I tended to use my Watch solely as a watch

357
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,887
And then I only had notifications for like

358
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Text

359
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
And that was pretty much it

360
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,335
And I tend to keep my phone on silent so the watch or the ring is the only thing I have that's like

361
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
Gotcha gotcha

362
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
Everybody everybody

363
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,927
You know we should mention down to folks who just bought a pebble timer time around if they bought it after January 21st

364
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
At the higher price

365
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,511
You can reach out to Pebble by April 1st

366
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
And get a price adjustment on the difference

367
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
No.2

368
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,375
50 bucks

369
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Back to music

370
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
I saw this

371
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
And I wanted so much

372
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
I think it's so cool

373
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
I may actually

374
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
I'm so this is

375
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,479
Hang on a second I have to say before the show

376
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
As we talked about what to talk about

377
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:22,879
Stacy was gushing over this thing so if it's not a parent enter voice right now to trust me

378
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
She is dying to see this

379
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
I love it okay so this is called the mighty

380
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
And this is

381
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,047
It's an iPod Shuffle for your Spotify play

382
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
That is like

383
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
I don't know who called it that

384
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
How did that but

385
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
That is what it is so you need to have a Spotify

386
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
And it has to be premium

387
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
Spotify songs that you have

388
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
Download certain songs

389
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:51,039
Download your songs for offline listening when you have a Spotify premium account

390
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,087
So when you decide logos onto this life

391
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Little

392
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Device that is

393
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
I-75 in

394
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
Yeah it looks like

395
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,119
It's just cuz it's a little square with a basically not like a jog dial but round button placement

396
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,703
It very much looks like a iPod Nano or Shuffle rather

397
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,751
That there's not much in it I mean it

398
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
There's a battery there's

399
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
Ortega storage

400
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,431
There's a wireless connectivity for Bluetooth headphones there's also a regular headphone jack

401
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:25,087
Oh yeah I didn't realize I thought I had to I thought you had to do it over USB very cool

402
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
Sweet

403
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,999
Anyway it's such a Nifty little something

404
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
Would make Maybe

405
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
That would sell gazillions of

406
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Puppies

407
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
Units units

408
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
Students

409
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
Man I'm so glad this is being crowdfunded

410
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
Although I don't think it's made it to it

411
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
It's cool yet so it's

412
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
70

413
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
$9

414
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
For one of these

415
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
Kickstarter

416
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Right

417
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
You can also pledged $5

418
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
And getting in

419
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
Yeah I think I won't do that

420
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,951
So it is raised 180000

421
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Send

422
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,279
Now that's $10 you can have a photo of one

423
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Excellent

424
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,143
So they raised about a hundred eighty thousand

425
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
Send 200

426
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,495
I go back at its going to ship in November

427
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
Actually happens

428
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
I am content

429
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,151
Concerned about licensing hopefully Spotify works with them

430
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,503
Hopefully the licensing of the music like I can see how there might be problems

431
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,623
I don't know about that and I'll tell you why I mean if you can already download

432
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,183
Music with a Spotify Premium subscription

433
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,743
Can listen to offline on your phone

434
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
I can't really see the difference

435
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
2

436
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,631
Pushing across one more wire to another device

437
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
There might be intelligence

438
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
DRM associated with

439
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
The app on the phone

440
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,799
Typically cuz I believe Microsoft

441
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:53,663
Do this way back when with the zoo and you could download all the music you wanted

442
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
From your subscription

443
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
But you had to resync the Zune

444
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
With your car

445
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
Computer so we could go and double-check

446
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,647
Your subscription status every 30 days or less to make sure

447
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,951
That you still were paying if not

448
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,767
That it would automatically DRM lock all the songs

449
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:14,399
And that's what I'm assuming what happened cuz it was Spotify the same thing also like you have to

450
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Castle link every

451
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
I think it's at 4:30

452
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Days may be hung

453
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
So

454
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,615
I love this because I like to go out without my phone

455
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
I love the idea of having

456
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,223
Dislike little tiny clippy thing on when I go running or working out

457
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
And

458
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
Maybe then I wouldn't need a smartwatch that

459
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Guitar music

460
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
FairPoint

461
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,183
Alright good luck

462
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
Good Law School

463
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
All right

464
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Now

465
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
Industrial news

466
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
We don't talk about this

467
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
Because I forgot

468
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
Occasionally

469
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
There is trouble in standard land

470
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,591
And let's see if we can get this right with all the acronyms

471
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,615
Hellboy

472
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
I know

473
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
We got a new

474
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
Foundation

475
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,503
It is called the open connectivity Foundation

476
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
Ocf

477
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
Dallas New Consortium

478
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,647
Includes Intel Microsoft Samsung Qualcomm

479
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
A whole bunch of other vendors

480
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,255
And they're going to push what's known as the iotivity stand

481
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,791
Going forward

482
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,375
In this standard is used for discovery of devices

483
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
In

484
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,423
Communicating what they can do

485
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,983
You guys might be going

486
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
Wait a second

487
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,847
Some of these guys have their own standards right

488
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Allcom

489
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Had

490
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,711
All joy and they actually form the all seen alive

491
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,527
With some of these Microsoft actually was a premier member

492
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
They were really important

493
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,183
Electrolux in some of the other kind of companies

494
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
And

495
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,583
When Intel launched their Foundation

496
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
Which they called the open internet

497
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
Consortium

498
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,423
2014

499
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,031
Intel launches a Qualcomm freestander

500
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
Because that's

501
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,895
Essentially what it was both kind of groups

502
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
Pushing the same

503
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,991
Standard which was device discovery

504
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,783
That never happens with standards

505
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
Never

506
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,207
So here's here's the bottom line

507
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
What I discovered in tok

508
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
People

509
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
And this was not easy cuz no one ever wants to admit

510
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
Things made out of

511
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
Rosie

512
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,959
The Qualcomm folks that were working on

513
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,239
The development of all joy

514
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,543
That whole team is actually DeCamp

515
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
10 God / 2

516
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,127
So those guys are not working until

517
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
Which I

518
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
Imagine hat

519
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
No small

520
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,527
Leaving it we're taking our standards with us

521
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Still exist

522
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Is there still

523
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
Working for the good of

524
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,279
You know the Internet of Things in the standard blah blah blah

525
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,303
It looks like

526
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,143
Almost all of the code and development is going to be happening

527
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,703
Under the open connectivity Foundation

528
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,263
We should expect to see

529
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
Most of the work happen

530
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
There

531
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
Device discovery

532
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,919
Most of this looks like a license

533
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
That's an issue

534
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,759
Can get into the Arcane politics

535
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,063
Standard settings organization or

536
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,367
It really super duper arcade politics of license

537
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
Guess who

538
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
But that's kind of what seems to be

539
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Driving

540
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Is

541
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,632
To license the standard and who has to pay if we use this technology

542
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:32,288
It's rather interesting to me after watching Intel on Qualcomm go at it in the chip business for

543
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,592
The past I'll say 10 years or so

544
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,664
When it comes to mobile and desktop / laptop

545
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
And now they're

546
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,504
Fighting it out / working together

547
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,808
For the iot chip business

548
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
It's

549
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:50,208
It's nice right you like

550
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:56,096
One less standard right is what it kind of feels like

551
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,888
But yeah it's essentially one list

552
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,936
It's by no means

553
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
The singular stand

554
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
Because

555
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
Homekit

556
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,568
Is trying to do the same darn thing only it's closed in

557
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Apple

558
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
And then Google

559
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
With

560
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
Weave

561
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
Is not necessary

562
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
Which

563
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
May or may not be doing this

564
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
Is also doing this

565
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
So

566
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:22,208
We can't really have like some singular standard when we have two of the largest players in the industry

567
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
From the handset side

568
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
We like our

569
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Let's try to make these

570
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,888
Yeah

571
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,192
Say hey

572
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Headsets

573
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,520
Not needed we're going to go with gesture control invoice

574
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,824
Smell you later Google and Apple

575
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
What do we think

576
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,224
No I think the smartphone isn't going away anytime soon

577
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,784
Maybe find why someone try though

578
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,088
Good luck with that

579
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
Smell Ya Later app

580
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,208
Okay so that was that was one on the

581
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,768
Kenneth Moore Industrial side of things are the more

582
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
Can Enterprise E

583
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,584
Less Fun Gadget side

584
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,632
And let's see what else do we have here

585
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
We have

586
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,472
We have it's time for a guest I guess that's right

587
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:11,104
Like we said it is Chad Curry the managing director for the center of real estate technology and if you stay tuned

588
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,408
He is going to talk to us about

589
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:20,576
Touchy Realtor about technology giving smart hubs as a closing gift and how your ml

590
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:26,976
Things may change

591
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,816
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

592
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
This is your house Stacey Higginbotham

593
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,168
Our Guest today is Chad Curry

594
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,752
Managing director of the center for realtor technology

595
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,568
National Association of Realtors

596
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,176
I'm great CC thank you so much for having me on here

597
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,456
I'm so excited

598
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,736
So

599
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,088
We had this awesome conversation

600
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
Smart Home

601
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
And he told me

602
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Why Realtors

603
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
Interested

604
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
Absolutely you know

605
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:09,472
Here's the thing is is we ran a 108 year-old Association

606
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,264
With 1.1 million members

607
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:17,920
And they are in more homes than anybody else you know they sell about 5 million homes a year in a lot

608
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:22,016
Happening in the space right now and you know by 2020 their estimates of

609
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
No 26 billion

610
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
To 250 billion

611
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,416
Iot devices being connected to the web

612
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,208
And so we got to get out of that

613
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,256
So that's why we turn to slap

614
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,608
When we talked before you you had talked about improving the existing

615
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,144
In home stock in what

616
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
Is

617
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
2

618
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,240
Get maybe new homeowners

619
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
I'm bored

620
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,336
Sensors that showed them things like

621
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,616
Hey your air quality

622
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
Could be.

623
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,712
Show them their air quality

624
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
Didn't think to make investments

625
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
In their home

626
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
Then boosted

627
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
The value of the home

628
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
Realtors happy

629
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
Winger

630
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,560
Yeah so it did that that is predicated

631
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,096
If you think about

632
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,656
You know say that you didn't care about

633
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,984
Taking 10000 steps until you got one of those turn things right

634
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,312
And that's kind of what we think is going to happen with Environmental Quality sensor

635
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,712
I mean you got this invisible are around you your breathing and you have no sense of what's in it and we think as a closing gift

636
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
What if

637
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
A realtor

638
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,552
Gave a homeowner

639
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
Ihob

640
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,672
And some Environmental Quality sensors that could allow that homeowner to understand

641
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,976
What the CO2 levels are for the home

642
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,024
What's the temperature and humidity are for the home

643
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,120
What do you particular matter levels are for that home in the vocs

644
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:45,472
And those metrics are going to help them understand how their living

645
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,520
And those things affect our health greatly

646
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,568
NIH just put a study out of

647
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
A few months ago actually about

648
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,200
CO2 levels outside it was Booth focus on Commercial properties office spaces

649
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,808
And they talked about what a difference a regular office space

650
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,880
Makes compared to the Green Plus or green

651
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,416
Office spaces that have

652
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,232
No air filters that are

653
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
Much more

654
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
What's improved

655
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:17,216
I mean that's what I bring to the existing home stock we want to make it so that people who buy an existing home because Millennials are

656
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,264
Clamoring for existing homes

657
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
And so we would have been

658
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
Bring things to them

659
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,432
I can help them have a better quality of life and was existing homes homes are built a hundred years ago that didn't

660
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,528
They were considering air quality air temperature and humidity at that time

661
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
But if you could mitigate

662
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,368
Problems like mold or bacterial growth

663
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,208
Bi monitoring what your humidity levels are in a home

664
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:44,096
Going to go a long way to having a better quality of life in that home and we think our membership can be a part of that to a partnership

665
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:48,192
What's really interesting is if you start taking that a step further and you give

666
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,728
People the tools

667
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,056
It makes them familiar with it in their homes

668
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,104
They could actually take that to

669
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,920
You know things like home water testing and then

670
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,968
Implicit activism on the scale

671
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
You could see

672
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,576
Leaving out of prevention of Something Like Flint Michigan

673
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
But I mean

674
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Empowered enough

675
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,720
It said holy cow

676
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
My hair is

677
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
Really toxic

678
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:19,168
Yeah this is this is about improving the housing stock and quality-of-life for everybody and then that's exactly right

679
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:24,288
Things that where we're actively participating in our things like the array of things project

680
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,824
Keep using the word things but I

681
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,152
I can't get away from it right now we're talkin the iot podcast

682
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:36,064
But the array of things project is happening here in Chicago and the city of Chicago

683
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,880
University of Chicago Argonne National Labs

684
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:43,232
All received a 3.1 million dollar Grant from the National Science Foundation

685
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:48,352
Put 500 nodes around the city of Chicago so we can monitor things like air quality

686
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:54,752
The amount of people in an area outside it's not it this is not a surveillance thing it's that is not anything we're interested in

687
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,800
What were interested in though is

688
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:03,200
Is traffic levels in an area because that could impart you know what's happening with the commercial

689
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
Real estate

690
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,576
Immunotherapy trophic levels go down there might be an issue in that area that could

691
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:13,440
I'll be improved upon to improve the commercial real estate space where the residential space

692
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:18,816
Project the way we are approaching this entire

693
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,144
Space is if we think of the home as a cell

694
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,472
Right now there's nothing in the home that allows for homeostasis

695
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:30,336
The self-regulating as you have in a Cell for biology any of the eukaryotes that have the nucleus

696
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128
And self-regulation

697
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,432
So you think about that you got the home and sell

698
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,016
As you work those homes work together and you have an aggregate of data

699
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
You start to build tissue

700
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,112
Commercial buildings and become like organs

701
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,720
And the city itself becomes like a body so you have this organic living breathing thing

702
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,792
And this is this is already happening these things are organic

703
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,352
But we don't have any insight into their performance

704
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,448
So we can't make improvements upon what's happening already and that's what we want to do is

705
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,728
Has helped build that

706
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
So

707
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:04,896
Our communities can take action to improve upon their quality of life and homeowners can do the same thing in our members can be a big part

708
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,480
Okay so you start with data about Environmental Quality

709
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,344
The Next Step though once you have this data is taking action

710
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
Where are you guys

711
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,464
Or is the array of things project

712
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
Going that next step

713
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,024
Or is it just

714
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
Okay so what are you

715
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,168
Project open data

716
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,984
I'm so app developers can build upon that

717
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:35,104
So the data coming off of these devices will be in a repository at the city Chicago site

718
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,736
So people can take that data and start building apps that can tell you about the best path to walk if you have asthma

719
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,040
Or you know what's that

720
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,112
How quickly is standing water being taken care of in a city

721
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,440
Or what are the traffic patterns like on a

722
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,256
July vs December in Chicago

723
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,560
And what I should mention about that

724
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,864
Project or not only other thing they looking at

725
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,936
Chicago they have 15 partner cities around the globe

726
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:04,032
We're also going to do the same thing put these devices out so

727
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,056
And so

728
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
What we're hoping is

729
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:12,992
With our little project we've been doing we're calling Rosetta home and I know I given you some screenshots when we

730
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:17,600
Meet we talked about last time about what that looks like with CO2 monitoring and temperature humidity in

731
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,904
And an energy monitoring

732
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
We want that

733
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,696
2B you know

734
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:26,304
Got to be a place of action for these homeowners in for the community itself

735
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,400
And I think that's a really important

736
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,960
And I I'll be curious to see how

737
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,264
Home Motors any good Realtors kind of take

738
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
Action because

739
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,568
It's one thing

740
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
Here's an informative app.

741
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,456
Succezz

742
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
This is happening

743
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
And then

744
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
There's things that

745
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:50,880
Individual action and then there's the collectively

746
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,648
Better axe

747
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,208
Yeah and I think you know for us

748
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,096
Our members you know the value to our membership here is that they have a relationship without a homeowner

749
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
Outside the transaction

750
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:06,496
Right so they're able to work without homeowner in and be a partner in the ownership of that home

751
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:12,896
And the value is you know that they've got a relationship that they formed and in that naturally becomes a elite generator

752
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,712
But also when that house comes back on the market and 7

753
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:19,040
Veneers that homeowner is going to work without realtor

754
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,856
And when they work with that Realtor

755
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,904
Things that can become gachas

756
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,232
Over the process of owning a home things like mold you didn't know you had

757
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,536
Because you weren't monitoring the humidity or

758
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,328
Particulate matter that could cause

759
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:38,240
A child to have a hard time breathing with respiratory issues those are things that you work with that homeowner to help mitigate so when it goes on Mark

760
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,288
That's less time you have to spend on

761
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
Dealing with those issues

762
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:45,664
Proactive type thing between the homeowner in the realtor

763
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
Will we ever see

764
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,712
Sensor data Spark

765
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:55,392
Also that's the project we worked on is exactly that we both over a course of a few weeks we took it to

766
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:00,256
Are standard body in real estate is called reso the real estate standards organization I'm a board member

767
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:05,376
And I took my team down there Chris Cote Varley lab engineer and Dave Conroy who's our lab engineer

768
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,728
The three of us went down there and we presented what we done which is where we took a listing

769
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,776
Tv listings right now

770
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,848
There static there is essentially what you had in the listing books

771
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Before we had the intern

772
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,896
Why not make that

773
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,456
Why not have that information accessible

774
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:25,856
22 Byers you know in and we think that when a buyer's first moving into that process of of going

775
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,904
Away from the home they own to this new home

776
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:31,488
And we give him a closing gift of this device with the sensors

777
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,048
That's an opportunity for them to them start

778
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,584
Moving down a Paso

779
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,424
A corrective action on that home in a way that is informed

780
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:46,080
You know that they know what to work on because they have that data we had a few mls's talk to us about including that data and their list

781
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,896
Now I wouldn't want my actual data

782
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
Set the show at

783
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
Catholic

784
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:58,112
It would be aggravated you don't want you know you don't want to be able to see certain patterns like CO2 patterns

785
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,952
You know if you had CO2 patterns listed on a on a regular basis

786
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,816
Hourly basis somebody could look at that and see how I know when they're not home

787
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,376
Why do we break into their house then we that we do not

788
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,216
Of course so that's yeah I would have to be an aggregate a type of date

789
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:19,872
Now you can totally tell when people in my house are taking a shower

790
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Yeah

791
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,968
Because

792
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,504
You are so associated with

793
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,832
Real estate market in everyone loves

794
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,856
Or at least that's what

795
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,904
Everybody I know loves talking about

796
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,720
Let's talk

797
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,768
Well it's not really a game

798
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,584
What bone exist

799
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,376
In homes of tomorrow

800
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
So

801
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
I think this all the time

802
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
That's my job

803
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
Because I'm a weirdo

804
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,312
So I'm going to throw it out there I think

805
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
Cheese

806
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,128
These are probably something we won't have like

807
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
No I don't know what

808
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
What are you thinking

809
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,808
Yeah so I gave a talk at a conference

810
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,904
About a month ago where I talked about was called 5 mind-blowing Technologies but

811
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,184
It was really about

812
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,744
What are home would look like in 2026

813
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,792
Things I don't think we're going to exist

814
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,656
In 2026 are things like the thermostat on the wall I think that

815
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
Within our

816
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
Homes

817
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,776
We're going to have sensing technology integrated into the wall

818
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:26,432
So you can see temperature and humidity all up and down that wall as well as air quality sensors built into that

819
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:32,320
So you get a good sense of what's happening at ruin water sensors to I mean if you have a leak behind your wall

820
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,392
Yeah so what if a wall could

821
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,696
Change color where there's a leak in a way that's

822
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,976
And also alert you

823
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,024
Yeah

824
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:46,400
Takes it takes some time so what if it is soon as that leak happens

825
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:51,264
You are able to be informed upon you know that you're good but whatever device I would have limited to a phone

826
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,056
I with the wearables coming out

827
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,616
But whatever device you're wearing what if you could receive

828
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,384
An alert

829
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,224
On that and that's the beauty of that's a beauty this technology

830
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,552
Drywall will have sensors built into it your windows

831
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
I imagine it

832
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,392
Future Stacy where as you update your home

833
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:11,488
The listing is updated with data from those devices you're putting in your home you know

834
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,536
There's that there's a commercial

835
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:19,936
All kinds of card building information modeling I think that's going to come to the residential market and it's going to be informed by these smart device

836
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:26,336
We're putting in our homes I think you could have less and less of dog was not talk to people at work a beacon companies and they talk about beacons and what they can do

837
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,896
Anna Begins now are these these

838
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,992
Little Rock sir would have you devices that are freestanding

839
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,832
But I think Beacon Technologies going to be built in things like your lights

840
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,856
Or

841
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,160
Outlets whatever else you know wall fixture

842
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:47,328
So I think it's the world we interact with become less obvious in the home you know what I mean by it's not visual you don't

843
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
See the thermostat on the wall

844
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,656
I would I would love that

845
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,496
I would also love for my power outlets to go away but I think we're a little far off from

846
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:59,872
Tesla What will what happened to Tesla's hopes and aspirations you know

847
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:00,896
No one wants

848
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,712
Just yet we're working on it

849
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
Eventually

850
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
So here's that yours

851
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,088
I thought because this is something I think about

852
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,112
What about lights

853
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Stairs

854
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
There's an inherent

855
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,280
I actually had a designer in the show a couple weeks ago and he got me really

856
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,816
It was really the Scott Johnson

857
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,400
And he was talking about you know different types of lighting

858
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,704
Ambient lighting

859
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,008
Lower levels versus are overhead lighting

860
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
In

861
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,568
I was really fascinated by thing

862
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
Thinking about like

863
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,896
Yeah why limit lighting till Aiko

864
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,016
Q has with a light strip

865
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,088
So that allows you to do different

866
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,648
Places there and they have the bloom I think it's

867
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,488
So I mean you know I didn't end

868
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
I agree with you

869
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,096
Going to be limited just to the fixtures above your head I

870
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,400
I in fact it was a really interesting

871
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,752
Concept that is University of Cincinnati adult novel devices group over there

872
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
They had

873
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,104
Office in the office but I can see it working on as well

874
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
World Harvest

875
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,664
The Sun's light

876
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,200
End broadcast

877
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,248
Throughout the the office

878
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,272
She don't have that

879
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,320
Fluorescent light beer actually using sunlight

880
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:16,416
To create Lighting in the home so it's a very passive type of lighting

881
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
Isn't

882
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,000
A critical smart but it can be controlled without you knowing

883
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,304
Baffle of sorts so you can you can

884
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,120
You could have it be brighter and darker based on

885
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
Are there natural light but

886
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,704
I think the integration of

887
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,104
Smart devices in the lighting will lead to things like you know sad mitigation that seasonal affective disorder

888
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,408
And it's already happening with you but I think that

889
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
A sad room

890
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,504
As it were almost like a safe form of typeset

891
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,136
I think that helps you almost know it sounds really silly for me to say it that way I know

892
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,000
There's somebody there are so many things I want to take back in

893
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:52,768
That statement

894
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,608
You're actually you have a room that's going to help you be happy

895
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
We'll call it a happy room

896
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,448
Anyway but I think

897
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,104
There's so many opportunities for light to to be more natural and more surrounding and not feel like it's coming it's just

898
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
One Direction

899
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,664
I think there's a lot happening in that space

900
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
Let me go with

901
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,712
Like a super contra

902
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
Burchell predict

903
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
It feels kind of disturbed

904
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,392
Good everybody

905
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,416
Clearing House

906
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:25,024
This is less for somewhere like the us but more for a place like chinaware

907
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
You know

908
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,584
Density is important

909
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
Sitting

910
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,656
The cities are jam-packed full of people

911
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
But also wear

912
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,056
What about this idea that

913
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,896
With TVs in it you don't 4K and soon-to-be 8K

914
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,944
What about we lose windows

915
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
Which actually makes

916
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Buildings

917
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,040
Very interesting

918
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
And somehow you think about Lake

919
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,392
Lighting that can be delivered via LEDs

920
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
Can prevent

921
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,208
Seasonal affective

922
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,256
Yeah

923
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,304
How to screen

924
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,352
I don't know is that crazy

925
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,656
Yeah I mean I think I think it's not

926
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:09,056
In fact our lab we have no windows that we have glass that is out to a hallway and I often think about

927
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,872
I mean you can make an experiential

928
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:16,224
Something very experienced you know there might be a place you love to visit and maybe it's

929
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,528
You know I love Florence maybe I have

930
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
Florence projected on a wall

931
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,600
You know it it has.

932
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:25,952
Natural light color with feels like I'm sitting in a conference room with a large window

933
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,744
Ionic and not

934
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
Can affect you

935
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:33,376
Office productivity in about about Smart Technologies I had there's a

936
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,984
Center for the built environment at Aaron's and his team David layer

937
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,288
Out in Berkeley they've been looking at office

938
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,568
Productivity and

939
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,968
Comfort levels in the office and they come down to it being a behavioral in fact they talked about Heating and Cooling and how much energy

940
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,760
E-Waste trying to cool

941
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:56,160
Are heat entire room and they come down to having products actually have something called hyper chair which is an office

942
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,464
Trailer has fans and heating and cooling elements in it

943
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
And you can control

944
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,536
Your comfort locally

945
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,584
At that space you know what I think

946
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,608
I think you know that

947
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:09,216
I kind of figured out there but I think that window you're talking about or that of that led technology

948
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,032
That that fits a long it's the same type of thing or your

949
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,080
Dealing with someone who has a personal preference

950
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:19,712
You know what I think you could have some really resting I mean I can get to the micro units and smaller places

951
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
Can you start to have

952
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:26,368
Less and less opportunities to have like come in naturally and so what can you do to

953
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
2 offset

954
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,464
And make out to pleasing environment there's actually a

955
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,792
Call Black Mirror have you seen anything for you

956
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,560
That's what I

957
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,584
Picture of the guys

958
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
Riding bikes

959
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
Yeah exactly that's that's

960
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,192
I was thinking about that as well but I like to think

961
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:44,544
What's dystopia with respect to that I hope I'm hopeful La time

962
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,360
I'm pretty hopeful for the the quality you can bring till

963
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,920
Cuz yeah you're right I mean it could be very

964
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
Very lonely

965
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
You know there's a possibility

966
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,808
So what about let's let's go cuz

967
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,904
We brought up Black Mirror so it in the episode that we're thinking of it I can't remember the title of it

968
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
Stationary bikes

969
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,280
People energy to generate energy

970
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,096
One thing that I think about a lot with

971
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,912
Smart Home in a lot of these Technologies is that

972
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:15,008
We're probably going to consume more energy because we have more devices

973
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
Set to consume energy

974
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,128
There are energy saving things out their butt

975
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,176
What are you kind of working on

976
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
You know what the idea that

977
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,552
Hey yes we are adding more stuff to her wall outlet

978
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
But what are we doing

979
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,600
Please save energy

980
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,488
Yeah you know there are some really interesting things happening in the What's called the energy harvesting space

981
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,792
University Michigan has group

982
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:42,400
Collab 11 and a Gentleman and purple. So it's his group they have a lot of

983
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:46,752
Smaller devices actually when I talked about having sensors inside the walls they have a

984
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:53,407
Something called smart dust to these computers that are about the size of a grain of sand and you can have an array of them that mesh

985
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,175
And they

986
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,223
Have different sensors in them but

987
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:02,623
They are working on a lot of different types of energy harvesting Technologies solar panels that Harvest energy from the light above you radio wave Harvest

988
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,159
Testing Technologies

989
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,975
So that those those devices are self-powering

990
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:11,583
But I think energy harvesting is the is what's going to happen for those devices met something I'm very interested

991
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,447
You know I talked about beaconing technology earlier and you have the limit of the battery so

992
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,031
As you to play more more sensing technology around the city what if we could

993
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,823
Be responsible for its own energy

994
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,895
Solar panels that I don't think

995
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:31,295
They're going to have solar panels just yet but I can imagine a future where those devices could be powered by solar is it becomes cheaper

996
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,855
For those devices to be produced

997
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,391
It's actually Kevin and I are

998
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,487
Actually right after CES we had we talked about

999
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,791
Arm has shown off some of the

1000
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,095
The smart dust kind of Motes

1001
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,911
And this was a tiny little chip that had

1002
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
Like

1003
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,959
Basically

1004
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:53,311
I can't remember the arm processor name but it was like it did on the edge of my fingertip

1005
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,895
Kevin and I were kind of puzzling out different things we could use it for

1006
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,687
And I should have thought about

1007
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,455
Powering

1008
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Wallpaper

1009
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,271
Cuz it's solar-powered we're like

1010
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:06,367
You can't swallow it we were talking about using it as like blood pressure in the eyes but

1011
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,415
You think about sticking it you know

1012
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,439
Wallpaper

1013
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,231
Connecting with natural light

1014
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,023
SodaStream might have Windows

1015
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:17,119
Really interesting or you know there were others that could be powered by

1016
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
Temperature change

1017
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,447
Interesting options

1018
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:27,615
Yeah I mentioned University Michigan they actually had some a research project where they had this

1019
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,943
Additional Bluetooth connected device that sat on the

1020
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,247
On the pipe of a shower head

1021
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:38,879
And you could tell how much hot water the whole was using because it would heat up to a specific

1022
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
Point

1023
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,183
And it would fire off

1024
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,999
Play music by a capacitor that they would fire off

1025
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
Answered

1026
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,327
You know give you a sense of the temperature for that

1027
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,887
The shower scene with hot water you were using

1028
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Very interesting

1029
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,191
Research project they were doing

1030
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,215
Thought so

1031
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,495
Yeah but I think

1032
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,287
Lobbying

1033
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,079
Being what it is and in

1034
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:03,967
Things like the pi zero coming out and Chip and and all that they cost you the stuff is coming down

1035
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,247
Pretty greatly

1036
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,063
So I think in the pi 3 coming out

1037
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:11,391
Do you know what side the Bluetooth connection now

1038
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,671
As of today

1039
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,463
So that was pretty exciting me

1040
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,255
Cheaper and cheaper

1041
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:22,911
And the worst of a difference doing with their their iot educational arm I think there's a lot of opportunity in this work

1042
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
Write 2

1043
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,519
What is the one thing that you're hoping to install in your home

1044
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,823
Like this month this year I don't know

1045
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
I'm

1046
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,127
Really

1047
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,919
Very interested in voice

1048
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:38,783
Ina what that's going to mean for our home and so we don't have an echo in our home

1049
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,879
We are looking with Josh 8.8 eyes doing over

1050
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
J-star

1051
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,671
Thinking it over there

1052
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,975
I'm very interested in voice interaction

1053
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,791
And actually as voice interaction comes on

1054
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,607
I'm interested in voice recognition

1055
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,911
Not just that the voice interaction

1056
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,191
So

1057
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,495
If I have the Amazon Echo I'm not going to

1058
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,055
Toyota Prime in my home because I have to

1059
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,847
Kids who love

1060
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,919
They love certain shows and and I don't want them ordering

1061
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:10,271
Pacific shows on their butts as it moves forward

1062
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,063
I'm very interested in having voice

1063
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,391
I ain't what that's going to mean for the home I mean people disabilities and

1064
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:20,511
The elderly what it means for them to control their home and have the settings match where there

1065
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,559
Voices for me

1066
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,167
All right. Thanks so much for coming on the podcast today

1067
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,447
I really appreciate it

1068
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,239
No problem thank you so much

1069
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:36,383
That concludes this week show and thanks for listening to The Internet of Things podcast
