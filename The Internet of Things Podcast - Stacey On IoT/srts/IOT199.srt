00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,064
Today we're going to be talking about final thoughts from CES

10
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,368
A little bit about iot device

11
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,136
Surety

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,672
Actually a lot about iot.

13
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,488
Kevin's local supermarket is implementing

14
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
Robots

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,608
Excited about that we're to be talking about skills form anime

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,936
Little bit of privacy information

17
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,216
And a lighting

18
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,240
Position

19
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,824
Plus we are going to hear from fair come about its iot Edge database

20
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:46,848
And

21
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,616
Hear from

22
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,664
Ghetto giraffe who is the chief

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,456
Chief digital officer of ABB

24
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,528
The 34 billion dollar a year and Rev

25
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,296
The new company that

26
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,368
You may not have heard of but we're going to be talking about what he

27
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,904
He calls Maslow's

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,928
Hierarchy of

29
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
Coyote

30
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:02,976
It is an

31
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
Awesome in

32
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,536
I was really impressed

33
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
I think you'll enjoy it

34
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
And now

35
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
It's time for

36
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,656
A message from our sponsor

37
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,704
This week sponsor is a pharaoh

38
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,008
Are you looking for an iot platform

39
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,056
Figure out why Kenmore and dealing

40
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,336
Pharaoh

41
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,920
Avero customers have experienced as much as an 80% reduction

42
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:22,944
In time to Market

43
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,248
99% pure support calls

44
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,296
And a 10x higher activation

45
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,648
Plus they can we use 90% of their work from one project to the neck

46
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
To learn more visit a pharaoh

47
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
. IO

48
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
That's a f

49
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
Ero.

50
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,304
IO

51
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,096
Okay

52
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,888
Let's get this started with

53
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,704
CES we're going to mop up the last bits of

54
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,752
CES trends that we saw in

55
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,776
Tested

56
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
Play with it

57
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,592
Lord only knows what else so

58
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
Kevin you came back

59
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,712
With CES play so we're just going to apologize right now for any

60
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,016
Any weirdness in Kevin's Voice or demeanor

61
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
Yeah

62
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,136
Kevin is on Sudafed for like the fifth day in a row so

63
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,440
We'll see how this goes

64
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464
So something

65
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
Cuz I wanted to

66
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,024
I wanted a mop up some Gadget

67
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,328
It's cuz I covered them in various

68
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
Articles

69
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
Possibly in the CES

70
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Episode

71
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,448
But there are a couple things that I thought were

72
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
One is Schlage

73
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,544
Does sponsor or voicemail

74
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,336
They introduced a Wi-Fi

75
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
And

76
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,176
You know I think that's a big deal it's part of a

77
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
Bigger trend

78
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,528
Towards adding Wi-Fi to as many things as possible

79
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,088
That we saw at CES basically people don't want to have a

80
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
So they're like

81
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416
Hey can we do this with Wi-Fi or

82
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
Which makes

83
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
Bluetooth matches getting better so we're seeing

84
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
More low-powered sensors and such

85
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
Bluetooth

86
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,656
The endless leads to something we've been talking about recently and that prior shows

87
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
Zigbee and Z-Wave

88
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
I mean

89
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,800
They're just slowly fading away from at least on the consumer side

90
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:57,664
It seems it like you said people don't want to hug you don't even know what the benefit is

91
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,736
Which mainly is Automation and there are

92
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,784
Non-hub automation methods so

93
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
I don't know

94
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,880
Pino's Disick B&C way folks say just

95
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
I think it'll be part of the pursuit

96
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,976
I mean Amazon did put zigbee in the air

97
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
Plus

98
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,048
And I don't think it'll take that out

99
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
But yeah I don't think

100
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
I think if you're just

101
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
Casually trying to

102
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
Connect sump light switches to your

103
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,216
Amazon Echo or

104
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,288
No door locks are video cameras you're going to try for all wife

105
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
World

106
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,968
Write in a treehouse of my take on that on the CBS fam

107
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,088
It was like not even part of the conversation I'm curious since we split up most days did you hear Company stock

108
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
Only the zootopia lion

109
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
Switch text back..

110
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Which is

111
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
There

112
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Ziggy Ansah

113
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
Thread combination

114
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Thanks so this is a

115
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,888
Deeply nerdy Wireless protocol for folks red was actually created by Nest way back in

116
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
The day and

117
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
With a bunch of other

118
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
And it is

119
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
Basically it uses the CB radio

120
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
Also 802

121
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
15.4

122
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
I hope tomorrow is like

123
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,968
So it's the same underlying radio

124
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,040
But it has software on top that lets it do things like

125
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,576
Go directly to the internet

126
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
IPv6 enabled

127
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,416
Smash therapy

128
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
Low power

129
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,000
So the idea is your zigbee stuff could actually be

130
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
Updated

131
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Possibly.

132
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Banana chips

133
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
Set to

134
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
Work with

135
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
With thread

136
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
And vice versa

137
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
Doesn't interrupt ability after they're also trying to bring it over Wi-Fi

138
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
Which again

139
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
So

140
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
Will see that would be

141
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Thread over wife

142
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Not

143
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
It feels

144
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
It feels like that ship may have sailed but

145
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
They said they'll be

146
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Products and 22

147
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
23rd work

148
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
With DOT.

149
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,415
You know I look for products in the other standards news there's

150
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
Open connect

151
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Ulta beauty Foundation

152
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,511
And they have their iotivity standard

153
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
This was

154
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
It was Intel's effort

155
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,887
They kind of subsumed all these Qualcomm alljoyn engineers

156
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,191
And basically I thought we'd hear from them at sea

157
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
But we didn't so I didn't know what to say to you guys

158
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
Is on the standard side

159
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
I'm feeling a big

160
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
Yeah

161
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
You know

162
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
Boc F gas

163
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:13,599
Say that their products out there there's nothing that's not a Gateway really

164
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,951
You know maybe in 2019 we're going to see stuff but I really am not going to hold my

165
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
My breath on this y'all so

166
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
Your standards are

167
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,559
Pretty much going to be Madame a witch

168
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,607
We call Amazon's ecosystem

169
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Or Google

170
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
And

171
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
And homekit in Wi-Fi and blue

172
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
So those are kind of diff

173
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Layers

174
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
For most people

175
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
Those are kind of going to

176
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Work with

177
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
So

178
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
That's

179
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,759
Is that the bad news that's just how the smart

180
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
And that is where we are

181
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,623
So back to his wife I like

182
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,671
Loxo Schlage introduces Wi-Fi lock

183
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,719
Wi-Fi is a huge power suck

184
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
So

185
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,071
That's why we hadn't seen a lot of Wi-Fi locks up until this moment

186
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
Company called Hampton

187
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Arabian

188
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,679
Break Stuff they had a Wi-Fi locked

189
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
They have solar power in it

190
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
Help offset the battery drain

191
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,543
If you get the Schlage Wifi lock

192
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
Depending on temperature depending on

193
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Number two

194
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Packers like how often you

195
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
Open your door and use this

196
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
You're probably looking at maybe a 2-month lifespan

197
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Inn on the batteries

198
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,831
Yeah that's a lot of batteries but it is

199
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Is Wi-Fi

200
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
The Sleep books actually

201
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
They told me they thought it could last forever

202
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
At four months

203
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,231
I feel that's really

204
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,023
But maybe I'm just

205
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
I haven't tested it

206
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
The alarm test so

207
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Want to see

208
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,191
So it's taking middle-ground and say it's 3 months

209
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
My Z-Wave lock

210
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
Usually 6

211
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,103
Easley the grant that I needed some I need a hub for that

212
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
So

213
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
Tentative get on the Wi-Fi network

214
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
Communicate with everything but

215
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
I don't know I don't know the people want to change their

216
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,159
Front door batteries every 3 months or 2 to 4 months or whatever it's going to be but we'll have to see him in the Proctors

217
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
In use for x amount of months

218
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
To be honest yes and it will vary

219
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
I mean weather drain your battery

220
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,143
If you got a hard lock to close and shut you know that my

221
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Have some issues

222
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
You know any other thing I noticed

223
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
With my zigbee and Z-Wave

224
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
Blocks they actually if

225
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,847
If you didn't connect them to the hub their batteries drained a lot faster

226
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
Because they were constantly trying

227
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
Connect to something so

228
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
Emma switch the locks would kind of be reversed in that the bolt that goes from the door where the lock is into the

229
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
Frame of the door

230
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,903
It actually came through the frame into the door

231
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
Because then you can actually wire it

232
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
Oh that's a really in

233
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,303
Yeah I don't know if it says secure

234
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
I can't see why it would be

235
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
Alright we'll see if

236
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:38,495
Hey if you work in the lock industry and have thoughts on that give us a call I mean that would be a

237
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
Something you have to build in that would be kind of a pain to Retro retrofit project old door frame out

238
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,479
Although it's a yes I talked to the mowing guys and they're changing the way they do

239
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,783
Plumbing a new houses so

240
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
Because these like

241
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,599
They're talking about like having connectivity in

242
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
The shower so that means you got to have electricity in with your showers

243
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
So what they're doing

244
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
Instead of putting a

245
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Electricity right by

246
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
Behind the shower wall

247
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Pudding

248
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
They're basically

249
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
Putting it

250
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
In a junction box where all the

251
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
The pipes for the shower

252
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,215
And that's where they're trying to add the elec

253
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
Atrocity

254
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
And I thought that was kind of an interesting thing

255
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
Now if you're doing a bathroom

256
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,871
Which is probably when you put the stuff in

257
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
You could do that fairly easy

258
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
So it's kind of an interesting

259
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
I think about how the Smart Home

260
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
Like these connectivity Alamo

261
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
Interchange

262
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Design of Art

263
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,599
Okay

264
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,879
Another thing that

265
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
I feel like we should talk about because it's

266
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Pretty freaking awesome

267
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Is Chamberlain

268
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
They did a deal with Amazon

269
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
So now you can use the Amazon key

270
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
Key Program Ashley it's not now.

271
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
It'll be later this year

272
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
The first half

273
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
This year what will happen is

274
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,263
If you sign up as a Prime member for the Amazon

275
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Key Program

276
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
You can actually

277
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
Have the

278
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,383
Amazon delivery person open York

279
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,967
Garage door if you have a Chamberlain MyQ compatible garage door

280
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,295
And that is so much better in my opinion because

281
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
Nobody's actually Ortega

282
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,415
In your house as soon as your door from the house into the garage is locked in.

283
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Yes

284
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,767
And I'm like super excited about this one because I live in

285
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,559
Texas where we have huge homes in

286
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
Lots of people in Costco so

287
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
A lot of people actually have her

288
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
Refrigerators or freezers in there

289
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
Garage

290
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,567
And so imagine being able to do grocery delivery into someone's garage as opposed to leaving it on

291
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,663
Porch if only amazon-owned

292
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
Although here I will tell you guys

293
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,039
That we get our groceries delivered on the rare occasion or sometimes

294
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
But they always take everything in a

295
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
Which is terrible if you have bananas

296
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
Cuz then they come out Brown

297
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,951
That is it so if you're going to

298
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
You're going to buy like four

299
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
The grocery store

300
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
You should not buy bananas

301
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
That is not a smartphone

302
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
Pro tip that is just a general

303
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Privileged

304
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
That's a produce tip

305
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
A produce tip

306
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Thank you

307
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,847
So I thought that program was really

308
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,151
Interesting there no fees for the consumer for

309
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:57,503
For that it does open up like you could deliver a lot more interesting things

310
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
Like you could order a larger TV

311
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
Computer I have no idea what I would order

312
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
But I like it

313
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,463
And I think it's probably something I would sign up for

314
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,767
Where is Amazon key I would not touch that with a

315
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
12 foot pole

316
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,119
I am right there with you even though I'm home most of the time I still don't

317
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
Amazon

318
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
Yes oh I should tell you that

319
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
Y'all

320
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
It is going to only go live in 37 C

321
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
Austin is one of them

322
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
I don't know about Harleys

323
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:27,455
I'm thinking not cuz we're not really a city classified as a village

324
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Yeah

325
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,551
The village of Harleysville is what greets you on the side when you

326
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Drive to miles

327
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,391
Strep throat

328
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,999
The other thing that I was excited about it CES was a lot of health and wearables

329
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
Some of it felt like digital snake

330
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,375
Best Buy

331
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,191
We'll have an algorithm then it will help you pick your

332
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,775
Best foods for your metabolism or we have an algorithm in it will help

333
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Help you

334
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
I don't know

335
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Use your brain better

336
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
So those

337
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
Agreed with a lot of

338
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
But

339
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
I will say that

340
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,807
I felt like we actually saw some really interesting devices that took

341
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
Like the last generation

342
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Snuff devices

343
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,671
Where you're like oh I'm going to give you information about

344
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
But your steps

345
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,975
And took that into like

346
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
Dunkin give you actual actual

347
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Information about your

348
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,447
Yeah there was quite a few of those some of the snake oil things I've actually having fun taking pictures of people trying them

349
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
People accept out in special massage chairs and wearing like a thing on their head that would massage their brain man was

350
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
Pine, Co

351
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,455
But there's definitely been some advancements useful advancements in this area

352
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,783
And I think podcast

353
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
Pryor when we're at CVS

354
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,135
Thinking about next gen tie products

355
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
Why things came out with their moves

356
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,791
ECG watch $429 which adds the same ucg type

357
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
Functionality that the Apple watch 4 has

358
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,631
Obviously too much lower price

359
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
And

360
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,239
You know I thought I thought price-point the addition of that to their existing line

361
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
Was rather smart on their part

362
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
Yes

363
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
And we also had some

364
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Smart

365
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Blind

366
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:05,503
News I mention this because every that is like one of the number one request once you get your license

367
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
I would like to make

368
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
My blind smarter

369
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,391
And there's been a bunch of Kickstarter efforts

370
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Really have

371
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
There's also a

372
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,487
Company called mysmartblinds

373
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
It's about $150

374
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
For that

375
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Retrofit

376
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,655
On your existing wooden slat blinds so it's kind of expensive

377
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
But I ran into

378
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
Access

379
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
In this company actually

380
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,079
She has like a little motorized thing that you attach

381
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
Hatched here existing

382
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Chords

383
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
Has to be a continuous loop

384
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Court that's the one thing

385
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
It's kind of a pain

386
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,783
But if you have that you attach this connected device

387
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
What the motor in it

388
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,599
He'll actually raise and lower your blinds for

389
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,159
It's $250

390
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
It's available now in Amazon

391
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
And

392
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
I thought that was

393
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
Pretty neat but

394
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
At the same time

395
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
Ikea

396
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
Announced smart

397
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
This is about

398
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
Time I went to Ikea like

399
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
Gosh last

400
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
I think it was last brainless summer

401
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
I don't remember

402
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,079
It was months ago I remember you telling me

403
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
So long

404
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Hand

405
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
They showed me this

406
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
And they were

407
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
And they were going to be

408
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
So cheap

409
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
Kevin do you remember how much they cost

410
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,183
I think they start at $113 and go to Lake 180 or so depending on the width

411
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
So that's a little more than they

412
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Lacoste at the time

413
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,327
But that's fine cuz still those are really real

414
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
And these are all

415
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
These are a whole set of shape

416
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
This is not a right

417
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,263
Right and the retrofit would not work for me because I

418
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
Considered it but I buy cellular

419
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,359
Shades with no cord

420
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
So there's no

421
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
When I can retrofit there's nothing to

422
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
Winder online if I had a motor there

423
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,295
I may go look at the I can try

424
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
For the shades

425
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
There you go

426
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,671
So yeah so smart blind World finally opening up

427
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Woohoo

428
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:54,559
I mean I know this is a silly thing to get excited about but I guarantee you a lot of people are going to be excited

429
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,119
I don't think it's silly because most of the

430
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
Smart blinds to date

431
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,239
You're literally you're starting it for $300 a window

432
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Yeah

433
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
Yeah it's very expensive

434
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
And if you want to go like

435
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,895
Crazy higher-end shades are you have a lot of fiber

436
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
Then you're looking at like

437
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
I'll tell you guys I have these like

438
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
10 x 14

439
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Cheap windows

440
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,575
My shades basanti Shades I have Earth

441
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
$10,000 a window

442
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
I mean it is

443
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
TQ

444
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
Yeah and

445
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
I had to spend

446
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
An extra Lake

447
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,839
Six hundred bucks to get a retrofit

448
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,143
Play the special proprietary Radio 2

449
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
Z-Wave

450
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
Converter

451
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,519
That is not my favorite to buy some he did actually announced a

452
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
Cubs it does there

453
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Proprietary

454
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
WiFi camera

455
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
So now that it's

456
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,967
And I'm assuming he's require the tradfri Hub

457
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
They do require

458
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
Expensive

459
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
No not that one

460
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,111
I got one of everything

461
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
Okay

462
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
Other cesa

463
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,767
You know anything else that stuck out at you or you were like

464
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:03,935
You know I hate to be maybe it's cuz of my medicine me I hate to be the downer but I can wait from CES

465
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
Just kind of

466
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
Attitude

467
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
Any other cool gadgets and you mentioned a bunch

468
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,103
Instagram

469
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,663
Talk about them in the last show but you know

470
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:20,319
I don't maybe my expectations are too high this smart home is still not smart I'm wondering in this is what I wanted to say

471
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,367
CTS where is the predictive

472
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
Learning and

473
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,951
Machine learning and AI

474
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Big Data

475
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
We can

476
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:32,863
Using devices for years several years now and all this data is collected on how we use the

477
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,655
Protocol Smart Home

478
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:38,495
But we still basically have voice control and program yourself automation

479
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:44,895
Why doesn't the home say hey I notice you turn your lights on within 5

480
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,735
It's still very manual and I don't understand that

481
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:55,391
I don't either I mean I don't know about you but I signed up for the Amazon hunches which is the closest we're getting to that so far but

482
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
I haven't actually gotten

483
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
There are no

484
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,535
I have a hunch it's not that exciting

485
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,327
Well maybe but you know

486
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,631
Oh I should mention briefly

487
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
Digital assistants in cars was

488
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Totally a thing

489
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
So

490
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
Send I thought of that

491
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,567
Because I still haven't been invited to try out the Amazon Echo

492
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
Car think so

493
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,687
And related to what I was talking about and digital assistants

494
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
Google did

495
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
Announce

496
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,295
Through its partner Hard Rock Orlando valet

497
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
4 inch touch screen smart clock

498
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
It's $79

499
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:33,279
It's like the other smart displays obviously smaller microphone no camera for his touch screen as I said speaker

500
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
And

501
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:38,655
It will actually this is kind of what I'm hoping to see for

502
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,751
It will suggest alarm times based on your morning and evening routines

503
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
And my hope is

504
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:50,431
Since Google knows the events on your calendar like if you got an early meeting or something and traffic is bad and already knows that

505
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
Can tell you that

506
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,551
Practically maybe we'll start using that data to suggest

507
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
Alarm times and such

508
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
Sure wake you up early

509
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,695
Yeah see that's now that's a smart home

510
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,487
Example that's the stuff

511
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
I want to see and

512
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,815
That was like the only real

513
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,863
Glen said that that I got it for you

514
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
Yeah maybe next year

515
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
I didn't actually say that every year

516
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
I was disappointed by the

517
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
The lack of like soup

518
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,055
Check everyone is very focused on

519
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,103
5G or Smart Home

520
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
Connect with Google

521
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
Madam

522
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
In that to me was like

523
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,759
There was just an extension of last year

524
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,039
Yeah I felt like

525
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,087
I didn't see anything cool with like

526
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,647
I don't know designs for better battery life

527
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
The things that I

528
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Look for that are

529
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
Blow me out of the

530
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,791
The water like oh this actually could change the way we build products

531
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,095
I didn't see any of that I usually see some

532
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
But I did see

533
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,423
So in 2017 I saw a device like

534
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
I thought it was a meme space

535
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
Projector

536
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
You can interact with

537
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,055
It was from basa basa actually product

538
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
So that was kind of

539
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
But sadly no one else seems to be using

540
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Sing its own kind of like

541
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Oh

542
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
Oh well

543
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,647
Let's talk about let's talk about security which no one talked about

544
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
Yes I didn't get a lot of

545
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Security and privacy

546
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
Personally I don't know

547
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Nope

548
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
This is actually more on

549
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
The Enterprise

550
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,399
Industrial site but it's chilling nonetheless

551
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,703
Gemalto found that nearly half of work

552
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Organization state

553
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,311
Actually can't tell if they're iot devices were breached

554
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
So this is

555
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
This is a call for

556
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Auditing

557
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
You guys which is it

558
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
Erie Airport

559
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
To have his party

560
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
If your security rep

561
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:34,111
So gemalto surveyed 950 it and business decision-makers for this

562
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
Report that they made

563
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
So most organization

564
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
Consider iot

565
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
Security to be a priori

566
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,583
Nearly two-thirds so that's 57% of survey

567
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
Ben said their organizations

568
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,423
Have adopted a security by Design approach

569
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
Search for creating their own iot

570
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
And

571
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,799
Fewer than that so 46% said they thought that

572
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
Securities the main consideration

573
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Customers

574
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
I can go with that

575
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,735
Even consumers choose based on price

576
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
Enterprises

577
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
Their security

578
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
Concerned so I'm not sure

579
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
Who these people they in

580
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
Radar

581
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
So if it's

582
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
Consumer

583
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
If they're selling to

584
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
Consumer marketer in Enterprise

585
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
Other services found

586
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,119
Upwards of 80% of Enterprise users iot security is their biggest

587
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,911
Barrier to adoption

588
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,007
So security is typically right up there

589
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
No question

590
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:28,127
But less than 14% of the survey respondents iotv

591
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151
Kids are going towards

592
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
So

593
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
That's

594
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
That's not green

595
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,039
And less than 2/3

596
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,623
Only 59% says their organization and Crips all the day today

597
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,415
The capture or store Vio

598
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
That one jumped out of me that kind of

599
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
Shock Me

600
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
Yeso

601
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,583
I'm a little concerned everybody should be storing their stuff in it

602
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,655
Everybody should actually be doing

603
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
Security by Design

604
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,543
And you know everybody needs to have auditability so they understand

605
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
Like when

606
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,871
Things happened that they should know about

607
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:06,527
This is it expensive it's hard but if you're going to actually put centers on everything and start Gathering the data that you need in

608
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
And storing it

609
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
You have to protect that data

610
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,391
I find it interesting that if

611
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
Security is like a number one priority

612
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487
One of the easiest ways to

613
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,839
Check the data is to encrypted and yet companies are investing the time and effort to encrypt

614
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
Okay there we go

615
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
And

616
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
I don't know what else to say

617
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
But

618
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,079
For the more advanced people who are like

619
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,127
Encryption is not enough

620
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,407
Take it a step further

621
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
The IEEE

622
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
Has a solution

623
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
And boy howdy

624
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
It is quite the same

625
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
Solution

626
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
So

627
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
It is quite the name as well

628
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
It is so they're calling this

629
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,231
A reconfigurable secure

630
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,023
Security framework for iot

631
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
The acronym is

632
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
Res iot

633
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
The idea is you

634
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,191
You put a software-based security agent

635
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,495
On a wireless router a base station

636
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
Or a gateway

637
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,567
Spice so you put this on

638
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,615
Somewhere in your organization

639
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
You can talk to this

640
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
And it

641
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,967
Basically lets

642
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:11,039
That's kind of is a gateway security Gateway yes

643
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,343
The GateKeeper

644
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,879
It makes sense

645
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,208
Community can protect everything from the router on down this way

646
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
Gear

647
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
In much better shape what I don't understand

648
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
And this comes from

649
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,608
My other hat when I read about Chromebooks

650
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,680
Chromebooks are secure because every Chromebook

651
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,752
Has a TPM or trusted platform module

652
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,032
Which is a piece of hardware

653
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
And that

654
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,104
Checks up on boot up every time to make sure that the

655
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,152
The system firmware has not been tampered with

656
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,176
If it is

657
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,552
Totally useless to that point because it's been infected whatever

658
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
I don't understand why

659
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,136
Routers or some type of

660
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,696
Gatekeeping devices haven't used

661
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,024
This type of approach from a hardware standpoint other than cost

662
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
It just makes sense

663
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
Yeah

664
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,120
I mean in it could

665
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
I mean they say it

666
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
Require changes in Ark

667
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,984
Catchers and it doesn't but it does require

668
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Maybe a smarter router or

669
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,056
Gateway and that's not something that people

670
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Think about

671
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,640
And then the other thing is when you start thinking about that

672
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:14,528
You're bringing your it system in your sensor system which is usually an operational technology system that's been air-gapped

673
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
You bringing those

674
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
And that can be

675
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
Disturbing so this is America

676
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
Architecture we see actually

677
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,440
Industrial

678
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,256
So they have their sensor networks that are

679
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
The OT

680
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Talk to

681
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
A dedicated game

682
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
That Gateway

683
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,912
Handle security and all the in

684
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
Information flowing up

685
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
From

686
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
At the machinery

687
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,544
And then the it infrastructure

688
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,104
Connects down to it and you can't actually

689
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
It's designs for you

690
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,176
You can't have the it stuff

691
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
Talk down to the Cent

692
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
The design of a car

693
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
Car should be right so your

694
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
Canvassing

695
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
Ethernet never actually

696
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,880
That has been

697
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,416
Proven unsafe as in

698
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Charlie Miller Jeep

699
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
But

700
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
That's the idea

701
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
And you know

702
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,304
Depending on how you do it you're actually

703
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
So take a look at this will link to

704
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,936
The story about this it's definitely interesting it's deaf

705
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
Currently a nice way

706
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,264
To you know maybe retrofit

707
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
Security into

708
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,384
Your organization although you should still be encrypting in auditing and

709
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Other things

710
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
Speaking of sex

711
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,968
Security Trend Micro released

712
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Report

713
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,272
Tell me about RFK

714
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
Taxo this is radio frequency hack

715
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
And

716
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,160
It is scary as all get-out so the report's findings

717
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
I found

718
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Problems

719
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,536
In cranes drills mining Machinery in other industrial device

720
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
Produced by the 7 most commonly.

721
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,400
They are huge point

722
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
Securityweek

723
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,728
This is because they are connected there

724
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
Expensive to replace in there

725
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Painting

726
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
The patch and they exist in the field

727
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
4

728
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
A decade or

729
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,688
So This research is saying that

730
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
That they have

731
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
No rolling code

732
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
No crypto

733
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
And no software

734
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Protection

735
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,344
So you can have all kinds of

736
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136

Over-the-air updates

740
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,560
It's no thinking about cashing an industrial system

741
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,352
I think we're going to actually need some dude

742
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,888
Parameters around that to me

743
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
Dispatching

744
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,448
Is not the same

745
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
In

746
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
Factory or a mine

747
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,544
As it is in an IT organization

748
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
But still

749
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,640
We got to fix it snow treat an IT organization in the race to do that

750
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,920
Yes but

751
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
But it is easier

752
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,224
You can lose billions

753
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
Shut your factory

754
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,296
By accident during a

755
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,112
I mean it's a pain when your

756
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
Computers go down

757
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
Don't get me wrong

758
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,464
Okay as anyone can tell you like

759
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
Flying in the

760
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
Turkish Airlines

761
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Peter's go down

762
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
Okay so let's move on

763
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,168
Security and scary things and talk about

764
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
Fun things like

765
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Kevin

766
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,008
Your Supermarket is implementing robot

767
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,312
Yeah but you could be scary but

768
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,152
The supermarket is adding big googly eyes to this robot suit looks dirty

769
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
Approachable

770
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,992
The chain of supermarkets is called Giant

771
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,064
Giant supermarkets which is based in Pennsylvania

772
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,648
200 stores not just in Pennsylvania but

773
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
They are

774
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:05,792
Implementing robots in their stores or Technologies

775
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,376
It's rather tall it doesn't look like a robot it kind of looks like a

776
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,656
Oh I don't know about

777
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:15,776
Stalk on a base that just kind of Roads around that's why they put the face on that so it doesn't look

778
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
Weird

779
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,592
And have a lidar in it

780
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:23,456
Took a nap and never get the store it's got hi-res three-d depth cameras for navigation and

781
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
Data acquisition

782
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,320
Basically this thing can run for 12 hours on a charge and what

783
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,600
Does in the store

784
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
Is it

785
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
Looks

786
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
4

787
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,464
Tripping slip hazards on the floor

788
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
Which could be

789
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,048
You know anywhere that and they don't want me baby

790
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
Hurt themselves

791
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,840
Ricky Nelson

792
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:46,240
Yeah we're lawsuit yeah but he can also read unit tags and recognize if things are out of stock on the shelf and then

793
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,592
An alert employees when those items are available in the stockroom for restocking

794
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,152
But doesn't have arms that's not going to restock for you unfortunately

795
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
And it also can

796
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,992
Scan the prices and make sure

797
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
By checking the prices against

798
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,112
What's on the shelter's what's in the register database if the prices are accurate

799
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,440
So can actually let people know hey we need to update this tag

800
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
It doesn't seem to be really

801
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024
Taking the place of Annie

802
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,096
People which I think is a good thing but it seems

803
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:17,472
Are useful way to gather data and compare data to make sure the shopping experiences

804
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,264
Best as it can be so

805
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,592
I am looking forward I will take photos or video this thing when I see it

806
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
And Chase it down

807
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
Chase

808
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
Oh okay

809
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
Okay

810
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
And next up is

811
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,832
Hey Kevin is there money in creating cuss

812
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
Custom Madame Isabelle's

813
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,672
I wouldn't think so

814
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:43,072
But then I just read this article on axial saying that the New York Times is planning to make

815
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,096
Money building

816
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,632
Madame a skills

817
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,656
And

818
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,960
I'm surprised that they're getting into this

819
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,240
Basically

820
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,568
Time is going to create custom skills for advertisers

821
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
Enceladus

822
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,872
Is there a white label service

823
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,664
And they're not making any money

824
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,248
After they create the skills there's no like Kickback on the ads or not. It's just

825
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,552
Wheedle it you take it and go

826
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:09,184
I'm really surprised they've 175 people dedicated to this

827
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
And

828
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:14,816
They're expecting it'll take about three months per skill to make a custom skill and

829
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
I guess I don't know what they're charging for it but

830
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,424
I'm just shocked it's so it's like an ad agency

831
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
Kind of service

832
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,080
It is but did you expect the time or somebody to do is I did not they try and

833
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,176
Once

834
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
Right now so you got it you got it

835
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
Make money where you can

836
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,760
Damn

837
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Show me self

838
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
Let's talk about this

839
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:45,280
Hack that you found to protect my private conversations from my Google home or my Amazon Echo

840
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,072
Yet we for the number of

841
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:52,192
Stories in people with bowel concerns about how these microphones are always listening somehow

842
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:55,776
Every once in awhile the private conversations aren't so private and

843
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,080
Are two people that created the

844
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,640
How to hack basic cuz that's what it is

845
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
This hack

846
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,712
Under the name project alias

847
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:08,064
And what project Alias does or will do it's not ready for prime time yet

848
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,392
It will literally create white noise

849
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,184
For the speaker

850
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,000
Until you say the the keyword

851
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
And because of this

852
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
It will not

853
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
Hear your private conversations

854
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,704
Innocent a white noise what kind of balance battery during the gate that out

855
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
I think it's brilliant

856
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,264
Yeah I think

857
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,288
We honestly

858
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,104
These two companies were talking about Amazon or Google

859
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
She really buy it

860
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
Because

861
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,712
Mission implemented themselves at the device level

862
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
Well so what's interesting is

863
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,832
Cuz I'm less concerned about Amazon or Google hearing my stuff all the time

864
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
I'm more concerned

865
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,392
About someone

866
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,696
Hacking my microphones in those device

867
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
If that makes sense

868
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,792
So this way

869
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
That's

870
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
Correct

871
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632
Yeah I'd be all about that

872
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
So what

873
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
It's not out yet

874
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
That's so

875
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,472
We should just go check it out

876
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,008
What is Project alias

877
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,288
Project alias

878
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
All right welding

879
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
Okay

880
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
We got a little acquisition news

881
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,408
For everybody in the lighting world

882
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,712
Let you guys know how much I love my Lutron gear

883
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
Yay

884
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,760
They

885
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
Do not advertise

886
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,552
I just left them

887
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,856
And they acquired an outdoor lighting

888
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
Limelight

889
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
B

890
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
Purse price wasn't

891
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
Disclose

892
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:22,304
But we should be able to love my hope is like we should get awesome outdoor lighting

893
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
Tied into the existing

894
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,888
Lighting controls offer by Lutron

895
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
And Wallah

896
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,984
We have integrated lighting Oliver home

897
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,288
Amazeballs

898
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
Is it

899
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
It's just a tiny

900
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Little thing but

901
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Worth noting

902
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
And

903
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,712
That's probably sufficient for the news this week

904
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736

00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272

But that's the stuff we cared about

908
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,672

00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,416
When the bus is arrived.

944
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
The child survived

945
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,488
So that they can meet him

946
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,768
Andorno's Italy

947
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,352
So you have any ideas he's asleep

948
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
Tile

949
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
And

950
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,680
A few other option

951
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,960
Just didn't seem dope

952
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,496
Alert remotely

953
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Inn at the distance

954
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
That we wanted

955
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,056
Thanks

956
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,336
I want like it's used

957
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616
Case it's very practical

958
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,432
I love those practical use case

959
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
So much

960
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,248
And we have a really easy solution

961
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,296
It is going to cost in Escanaba

962
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,600
Scription cost but it is the Samsung

963
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
SmartThings LTE tracker

964
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,208
Yes this was announced

965
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:30,560
Couple months ago we saw it on the FCC database before they even announced it

966
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,400
Samsung site

967
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,216
It's 9999 for the tracker

968
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,752
It has GPS

969
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,032
LTE

970
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,824
It's water-resistant so I think it's

971
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,848
Perfect for

972
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
Attaching to

973
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:48,992
The wheelchair or any similar device that somebody wants to track for people

974
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,576
It does have a subscription that you mention Stacey but for the first year

975
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,368
That's actually included

976
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,416
So the cellular service is included

977
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
First 12 months

978
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,304
After that it's $5 a month or $50 per year

979
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,864
You know this is a very important use case I think

980
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,912
It's probably worth the cost in this case for

981
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,704
Rap

982
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,984
Margarita

983
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,336
I don't believe you need a SmartThings Hub with this because

984
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:20,736
Does require the SmartThings app and that indicates to me that you can get push notifications when the Wii

985
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:24,320
Wheelchair new gets into the geo-fenced home area Etc

986
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
An

987
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,672
There's no Hub needed there so I think you're fine with just this

988
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,512
Tracker and the app I don't know if your friend's son has a phone

989
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
But if they do have

990
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
A phone

991
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,864
Then you can use if

992
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,144
So ifttt

993
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,216
And basically load the app on the phone

994
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
And then create an apple

995
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,336
That basically win the phone gets within Wi-Fi range

996
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,128
Home it will

997
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,152
Send a notification

998
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
Vacation Center

999
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
To someone

1000
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,248
So this is an option that is

1001
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
Completely free

1002
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,320
It's going to have some downsides such as

1003
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
Latency

1004
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
It may also be a little weird depending on

1005
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,440
The wifi radius so

1006
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
It may

1007
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,768
Trigger a little early or maybe a little late

1008
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,304
And if there's no Wi-Fi network

1009
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,120
The phone doesn't have the Wi-Fi network turned on that's not going to work

1010
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
So that is an option

1011
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,728
That way and

1012
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,496
And you also have

1013
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
Right there's no fee involved.

1014
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
All right

1015
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
So

1016
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,688
That concludes this portion of the show

1017
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,968
Stay tuned

1018
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,504
Fergie toes you're a loser

1019
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,552
Is the chief digital officer of ABB

1020
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
They make everything from

1021
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,368
Plastic zip ties to

1022
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,392
Industrial robot

1023
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,672
So this is

1024
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,720
A ginormous Company 290

1025
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,024
We did not get into

1026
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,072
I can talk to this man 4 hours

1027
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,864
But we focused on

1028
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
His Maslow's

1029
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
Hierarchy

1030
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,448
Iot needs

1031
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,216
And

1032
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,240
Business models

1033
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,776
That might arise from

1034
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
Basically usage-based

1035
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,848
Pricing for

1036
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
Industrial

1037
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
So stay tuned for that

1038
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:59,296
Everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor

1039
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,600
This week sponsor is database provider

1040
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,672
Are command I have aloe vera

1041
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,696
Who is here

1042
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,976
Compare Cobb to talk to us

1043
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,280
About their age

1044
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,352
Summa question I see a lot of people asking

1045
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Is

1046
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,912
What should their iot Edge

1047
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984
You guys have actually built to database

1048
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
The edge

1049
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,032
LC Tri Edge

1050
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,080
So do you have any recommendations

1051
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,104
To share with our audio

1052
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,920
Depends on what is needed by the business

1053
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:26,944
Sanlitun

1054
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,528
Things to decide on so we try to help by making it a business

1055
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,624
For example user can store all the data at the edge and

1056
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,464
Send nothing of that to the cloud or if I decide that's going to send everything

1057
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,096
The clouds just or just the date of the thingy that the edge and almost kind of fractured his claws

1058
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
In some cases

1059
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,912
Just do what they actually need is to come

1060
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,704
Control the data in real-time

1061
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,728
And dolcenero

1062
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
Strongly recommend

1063
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,032
Tasha Smith

1064
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
Process to the edge

1065
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,384
Especially on the decision-making that you're trying to run

1066
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,664
Okay so

1067
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,712
I'm deciding between the edge in the cloud

1068
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
What are some of the things I need to

1069
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
To take him to come

1070
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Consideration

1071
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,064
Well you have to consider

1072
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
First acknowledge

1073
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:09,184
Both the edge in the cloud VR different roles

1074
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,720
That used different.

1075
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,744
Acknowledges and if

1076
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,512
Protocols

1077
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
That's pretty much

1078
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
The market has been discussing ass

1079
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
The Clash

1080
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,656
Between racial technology and information technology

1081
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,960
Make sure that you are.

1082
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,776
Technologies that support different protocols

1083
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,080
Especialista our standards already in place

1084
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:30,688
Saw some other things that I think it's very important to consider like for example whatever database

1085
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
Alaska

1086
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,016
Assisted on the edge this database needs to be able

1087
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:40,416
Go to provide you with flexible schema mainly because of the

1088
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,744
All kind of different types and in many cases

1089
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,768
Is the closer

1090
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,304
Just able to handle the data

1091
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,120
Producing native format the better for you

1092
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:53,984
Application here is really being able to store data like for a simple Time series

1093
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,056
Basecamp Alaska state of for you but it's

1094
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:02,944
The same time calculate averages in the medians automatically so you don't have to go back in Cuero today

1095
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,736
Crossed your data set stats

1096
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,272
Stop your real time

1097
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
Process in many ways

1098
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
What's worth talking about your is

1099
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,416
Nosql database

1100
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:16,512
And we definitely just I know SQL database is the best candidate for an adjective

1101
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,816
And some of the things that I think of

1102
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,096
As being really important

1103
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
For the edge

1104
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
Would be

1105
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
Security

1106
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,424
How do you guys

1107
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
Help with that

1108
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,264
That's a very good point if you decide if you're going to have to

1109
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,384
Transfer some of your decision-making to the edge you definitely going to have to talk to have to persist data locally

1110
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
For example.

1111
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Historical data

1112
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,272
This immediately leads to the need for encryption

1113
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,576
That's absolutely mandatory if your select

1114
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,880
Sister theater on the edge

1115
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:46,208
How many ways I was teased about combining the real time information

1116
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:51,328
Let's be produced by machines and equipments that you're controlling their be measured by its digital sensor

1117
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,376
What's so-called operational technology

1118
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,704
Or the corporate it Department that has

1119
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,080
Decentralized fuel of all its systems with information like historical date of orders cost and dementor

1120
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,384
We considered making sure that this information flows

1121
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
States with managed

1122
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
Project

1123
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,552
So where can we find out more about faircom address

1124
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,320
Tea tree Edge

1125
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
Database

1126
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,136
You can check website

1127
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:15,904

1130
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,192
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things

1131
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
Podcast

1132
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,008
This is your house Stacey Higginbotham

1133
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
And today's guest

1134
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,336
Is ghetto Jared who is this

1135
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
Chief digital officer

1136
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
Officer at ABB

1137
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,688
So how are you doing

1138
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
I'm doing

1139
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Thank you very much

1140
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
Okay

1141
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,064
Just impress everyone

1142
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
I think you should tell us

1143
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,624
What ABB

1144
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,160
Is and does

1145
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,208
ABB is one of the

1146
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,000
Industrial companies remake

1147
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:56,096
Technologies that helps to turn electricity into motion

1148
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,376
So we make robots

1149
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
Motors

1150
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,472
Control system circuit breakers

1151
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,496
We are

1152
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,312
34 billion dollar company

1153
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,848
48000 employees

1154
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,920
And we have been around for a little bit over on

1155
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,528
Exactly this is one of those companies that you will never hear

1156
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,808
In your day-to-day life

1157
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
But they are everywhere and

1158
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,392
So

1159
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,928
They're doing amazing stuff

1160
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,208
With the internet estate

1161
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,000
So let's just Orient

1162
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,048
Ask the chief digital officer

1163
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,096
How do you think about the internet

1164
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
Really a sumac

1165
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,568
There's a consumer Internet of Things where we talked about

1166
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:43,968
Colored light bulbs and home alarm systems and all kinds of connected speakers and devices like that

1167
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,040
Dustrial internet of things which is the other part of this equation

1168
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
We're talking about

1169
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:52,928
Devices that are connected but they're operating inside of chemical plants and facts

1170
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,976
Inside of mine

1171
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,512
Oil and gas field

1172
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,304
So as a chief

1173
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,864
It's afraid I'm trying to inject

1174
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,424
Digital Technologies in every product

1175
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
Conservative

1176
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
That is a

1177
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
Call order

1178
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,288
And I know that we have spoken

1179
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,568
About your maslov

1180
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
Hierarchy

1181
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,152
Of iot

1182
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,712
Because I think it's a good way that companies can

1183
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,480
Can look it up

1184
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,272
Assess where they are

1185
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,808
Signatureny

1186
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,112
The basically making more efficient use of their

1187
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,904
People their processes

1188
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
Resources

1189
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,048
I'd love to do that explain a little bit why I came up

1190
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,888
It's because the internet

1191
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:37,472
There's use cases that are different industries that are different

1192
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,544
Technology stocks everything from the very

1193
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,640
Small light sensors communicating analytic software

1194
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,432
In the Gateway at the yard Jordan

1195
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,200
Cloud

1196
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,272
Machine learning drone technology

1197
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,088
Too much to get your head wrapped around

1198
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:59,744
Companies and customers you're doing with the Internet of Things

1199
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,840
All the sudden

1200
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,864
Like mouthwash

1201
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,680
Iraq

1202
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,216
How do you say Stephens

1203
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:15,616
Community

1204
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
Classify

1205
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Aldi's

1206
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:22,272
Hundreds of thousands of individual application

1207
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,296
Really only about

1208
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,600
Five different capabilities AR level

1209
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,368
Dorney Park

1210
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:33,536
Whole bunch of application but nothing more than

1211
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:39,680
This thing we're going to put a little chip on it it's going to be able to talk we communicate and it tells us how it's doing

1212
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
Why do we care

1213
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
Mantra

1214
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,312
Because you can then at least go from taipei

1215
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
Maintenance schedule

1216
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:50,688
Commission-based

1217
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,040
Quite beneficial because there's a lot of equipment in construction

1218
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,320
Deployed and of course

1219
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:00,416
Maintaining it properly is important

1220
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
That's the base of the mount Lafayette

1221
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
If you can read

1222
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,024
You can probably also

1223
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,328
Meaning you can change value

1224
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,912
In that system you can write

1225
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,216
Naked

1226
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
The robot

1227
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,264
You can make it

1228
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,544
Do new things

1229
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
As a result

1230
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:22,432
You can go beyond monitoring and you can label a class of application but I call often

1231
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,968
You can make things on

1232
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,248
Faster

1233
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:29,344
Consume less energy be more reliable

1234
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:34,464
And of course this all depends on what the customer wants

1235
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,768
Memphis Behavioral

1236
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,792
As a supplier

1237
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,936
Because you can say to your customer would you like me to optimize this device for you

1238
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:48,800
During its operation to better serve your needs

1239
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,455
Devastation that's mostly where we are today

1240
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,015
Exactly right

1241
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
Probably

1242
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,831
60 70%

1243
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,647
NVM

1244
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,327
And it's very safe to just read as big as opposed to actually

1245
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
Got it

1246
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,423
So now let's keep moving

1247
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,447
Where can we ask

1248
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
Aspire to be

1249
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:22,335
Stacy the world

1250
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,199
Nice because you can put two versions

1251
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
People that make

1252
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
Look up music

1253
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
Motors

1254
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,183
Transformer

1255
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:43,071
We put all this time and effort in R&D and we have no idea which features are customers really do

1256
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,351
Because we have no feedback

1257
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,143
Or at least we didn't until now

1258
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,983
Feedback loops that lets us monitor the characteristics of the device

1259
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,335
Also tells us which button people do push and which dial people

1260
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,639
When you get all this data back

1261
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:01,503
Can you know which features they're using you know which components inside of your machine wear out

1262
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:05,855
Fastest all this wealth of data so you can now for the first time

1263
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,391
Make your products better

1264
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
Baseball music

1265
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:14,815
And I think that's really cool

1266
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,351
Byproduct of just having fun

1267
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,887
And what do you call that

1268
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,911
I call that product

1269
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:24,031
2.0 I called the idea that this was

1270
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:28,895
Product 2.0 because this is a product which actually based on this

1271
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,175
Digital feedback loop

1272
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,455
You keep improving

1273
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
You keep it already

1274
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,271
You keep making it better.

1275
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,319
So I think that's important

1276
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,903
Holding on because I think that changes the way a lot of

1277
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,927
Business works

1278
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
So we'll come back to what it was

1279
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,999
Support

1280
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
Nate

1281
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,047
Product 2.0

1282
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:46,815
But let's

1283
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,095
Keep moving up your higher

1284
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:52,703
Okay so now we're ready for a level four

1285
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,383
Welcome people save all the smartphone getting expensive

1286
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
Well

1287
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,175
Yes or no

1288
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,247
Inexpensive

1289
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,575
Your smartphone means that you no longer have to buy any

1290
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:14,975
Pocket camera for that you don't need to buy an alarm clock or that you don't need to have a

1291
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,999
What's happened is

1292
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,815
Those who become after those are features

1293
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,863
But you can add this is about

1294
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,911
Converge

1295
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,447
And of course if you have

1296
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,007
A piece of machinery and intelligence

1297
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,847
You can do new things like a witch

1298
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:35,455
It's like every other circuit breaker except that it has a computer inside and now it can do things like

1299
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,991
Measure the power quality

1300
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,015
Coming into the plant

1301
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,551
Pecan shed

1302
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:44,159
If you want to participate in demand response for you're getting paid

1303
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,207
Powerful

1304
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
And those extra features

1305
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,815
Apps you can download onto the circus

1306
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:55,935
Computer inside

1307
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,959
The last one is really the

1308
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,751
Changing of the business model

1309
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,823
If I'm not connected I have these downloadable apps

1310
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,151
To pay for this product would you like to pay for it

1311
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:09,759
He's done with me or would you like to go

1312
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
2

1313
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:17,951
Trifold in the maintenance the remote monitoring the remote optimization

1314
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:23,583
Staying up last month and at the end of that product

1315
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,655
Like me to charge you based on usage because

1316
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,543
Utilization

1317
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,567
I know how

1318
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,615
Spanish you like

1319
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:40,735
I can work out a system whereby you pay me the more you use it and if you don't give it a thought you think of that

1320
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,575
Of course the dialogue

1321
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,391
Conversation between the maker of that product

1322
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:50,463
Customer that products

1323
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,999
But those are very

1324
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
Industrial

1325
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,143
Economy hasn't haven't had before

1326
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
I agree

1327
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,215
And we will talk about that

1328
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,007
Let's go back to this idea of product

1329
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,567
Because in our previous conversation

1330
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,335
And you mentioned that

1331
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,127
Tesla is a good example of this

1332
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,175
What's the matter with this idea that

1333
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,967
The car is continually being

1334
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
Updated with software

1335
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
And

1336
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,575
It changes it usually ideally gets better over

1337
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,719
So with that that's fundamentally

1338
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,999
Is a different business

1339
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:24,767
As for a lot of come

1340
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,071
So if you're going to go from

1341
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,095
Making a robot

1342
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
I thought you said one

1343
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,655
Maybe you offer a service

1344
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,423
Contractor maintenance

1345
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,959
Contract for 5 years

1346
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,239
To making a robot

1347
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,263
Is going to

1348
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,567
Constantly get better and have a continuing relation

1349
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,591
Customer

1350
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,871
That feels like it changes

1351
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,151
Cell cycle

1352
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,223
Warranty obligations that changes your

1353
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,759
Cost of operating

1354
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
Producing a product

1355
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,575
Breakdown

1356
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,135
Relationship

1357
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,439
One of those things that is both

1358
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,743
Potentially

1359
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:59,327
Changed as a result if you have a product

1360
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:05,727
And in many cases the members should you have a complex system business where you make something that required integration

1361
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,519
Deployment

1362
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:12,383
They would have to cater you typically work with a channel system integrator people that store your product

1363
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:23,903
Past the point of sale is both an opportunity for the makers of the things she perceived as a

1364
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Weather Channel

1365
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,207
So you may

1366
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,791
Put your Channel

1367
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,863
Because they feel like you might use this

1368
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:38,495
To perceive to be bringing

1369
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,799
I'll install that if he

1370
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,591
And the maker of the robot

1371
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:48,991
You may not know where that's going because that's being done by a system integrator or some kind of engineering company

1372
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,295
Connection changes

1373
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,111
Relationship

1374
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:59,231
Because they see value in 10 Connected for the company that makes

1375
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:10,495
Have to do that just like in the world of Automotive it's best to have its own dealers or have that

1376
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:15,103
It is essentially altering the relationship that would exist

1377
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,503
Continue by dealer

1378
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:25,855
So you're talking about the company making it as well

1379
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,647
Clearly

1380
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,439
Where the R&D

1381
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,719
Shock the Moon

1382
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:36,095
From Hardware increasing video software

1383
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:40,447
Change for companies with traditional have relied on Material Science innovation

1384
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,751
Better Dentistry

1385
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,287
Understanding those deep

1386
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,311
Physical properties

1387
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,591
Ways to make the product better

1388
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,127
Janelle being able to do a lot of

1389
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:52,479
And that's a huge shift and kind of people that were looking to hire

1390
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,295
Materials engineering Stihl

1391
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
Ladders

1392
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:56,831
And so

1393
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:00,415
But you can affect the outcome of something

1394
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,439
Why does it

1395
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,463
In software

1396
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
Where

1397
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,815
Course Material Science may give you that Quantum Leap for that Improvement

1398
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,095
But that laugh

1399
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,399
Extra bit can usually be done

1400
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,055
Of the various components

1401
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:21,663
And I am curious because you guys deal with heavy Industrial

1402
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,199
And what if he

1403
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,735
I'm not going to call it an epiphany

1404
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,271
Because it wasn't quite so bright

1405
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,039
Is bad but

1406
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,599
Talking to somebody a John Deere about

1407
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,879
The right to repair issue

1408
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
And that is basically

1409
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,487
Machines

1410
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,255
Bear

1411
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
Forcing farmers

1412
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,583
To rely on the dealers to

1413
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,351
Repair

1414
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:42,399
A lot of people are very

1415
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,935
Upset by this and I get it

1416
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,215
First century

1417
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,007
People have bought a Prada

1418
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
Repaired at them

1419
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,567
Selves in bed response

1420
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,591
Before and after

1421
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
As we start putting

1422
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
Software in it

1423
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,943
The number of people who have that

1424
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
Joseph

1425
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,503
But it also

1426
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,039
Creates the snoo

1427
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,111
Relationship that some people don't seem to be willing to

1428
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:06,975
To give up and this ties to you know John Deere this might be the people who used to fix

1429
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,255
Your robots

1430
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,279
At various

1431
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,839
Factories that may not have access to as much as

1432
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,119
The things that might be causing the

1433
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
The problems anyway

1434
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,679
And even in a smart home

1435
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
I'm starting to

1436
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:20,031
Relegate some things over to software I'm losing the ability

1437
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Tweaker cam

1438
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,359
I think it's kind of a natural

1439
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:27,455
Abstraction that happens when you get things over to software but I'm curious

1440
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Collier

1441
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,295
Talking to your customer base or how you're thinking about

1442
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:36,415
Good question

1443
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,231
One example of that so you know

1444
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,767
This thing is huge debate

1445
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
Privacy

1446
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,351
I see a data who owns potato

1447
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
There's a similar

1448
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:48,447
Type of debate happening on the industrial side up

1449
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,495
The business side of this equation when it's really busy

1450
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,895
Property and data ownership

1451
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,175
Who owns what data

1452
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,967
And of course as all these devices

1453
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:05,343
We do get data back and one of the ways that we've tried to have that debate

1454
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,647
Clarify

1455
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,671
The different types of

1456
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,207
The data are so we have

1457
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,023
Identity data who you are we have

1458
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,351
Essentially Telemetry data which is the individual value that you

1459
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:21,471
Machine by sending back their temperature energy consumption

1460
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,007
Inside

1461
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:26,847
Which is you take all of that and you turn it into

1462
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,127
Friends and prediction

1463
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:31,967
And clearly the most sensitive of all of this Susie identity data

1464
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,247
Married to the Dilemma

1465
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,271
Why

1466
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:40,415
The weather like in healthcare in u.s. government has embraced something called Healthcare information

1467
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:46,303
Essentially mandates that identity data be stored separately from Telemetry data or measurement

1468
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,887
Potentially a good used to be made

1469
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
Public public

1470
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:55,775
Healthcare data because if we analyzed it better we might be able to determine

1471
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:02,175
But we can understand why people wouldn't want that individual disease information to be tied back to them especially if it could

1472
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,967
Check insurance rates

1473
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:08,831
To be made

1474
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,111
In the separation of

1475
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,391
Data

1476
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,439
Only part of this equation

1477
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:19,839
Being able to fix things and repair things I do think it's more more devices haven't better software than taking that into

1478
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,423
Prepare yourself is increasingly difficult

1479
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,959
What you do find is that

1480
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,263
Increasingly people want to make things work together

1481
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:33,663
That's very similar to be knowledge of your smart home

1482
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
Speaker

1483
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:39,295
How do I do that and that's the same that's happening in industry it's not that they want to think about the light bulb

1484
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:43,391
Speaker

1485
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,183
Driver Motors

1486
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:51,071
And there's a strong interest in driving towards greater standardization

1487
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,375
And this is where the industrial world has been

1488
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:57,471
Low because we have seen a great convergence away from

1489
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:01,823
Token ring and sddi and all these things 2 words pretty much Wi-Fi ethernet

1490
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,871
IP

1491
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,919
Let's talk about business

1492
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
So one of the things

1493
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,527
Charging based on use

1494
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,807
And I think that is

1495
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,087
Incredibly fast

1496
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,903
And I started out my career covering

1497
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,671
Cloud compute

1498
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:19,231
And that the big Trend there was moving your

1499
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,535
Capital expenditures in your it

1500
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
Infrastructure

1501
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,583
To an operating X

1502
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,607
Nature

1503
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
Payout

1504
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,399
No as needed

1505
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,423
Amazon

1506
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,215
Microsoft whomever and

1507
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,239
When I think about

1508
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,519
It sounds

1509
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,287
Awesome

1510
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,567
But it also

1511
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,847
Changes the wave

1512
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,127
Businesses are built

1513
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,943
The creation of wealth it's always been about

1514
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
Building up

1515
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,735
Your infrastructure

1516
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
Historically

1517
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,783
Right and owning saying

1518
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,623
And then taking advantage of those so like owning your own car than you

1519
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,415
Hire it out to people if you were

1520
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,183
Want to make money

1521
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,207
If you're thinking about your

1522
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:50,975
The car is at

1523
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:51,999
You pay for it

1524
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,535
You still never owned it

1525
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,583
And I think that's a very big shift work

1526
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,631
Going I'm curious about your

1527
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,399
Thoughts

1528
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,935
How to change the business mod

1529
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,471
How does that change

1530
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,519
Ideas of wealth in

1531
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,287
Halloween

1532
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,823
Can actually build wealth up

1533
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,271
So you mention cloud computing

1534
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:20,671
An interesting analogy but I think we're

1535
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:24,255
Gets a bit more problematic because it's a little bit

1536
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,791
Expected

1537
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:30,655
The nice thing about cloud computing is of course you can move the computer

1538
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:37,055
Centralized Batman as long as the work is getting done and good response you don't need to know

1539
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,871
And the reason why

1540
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:46,015
What's economically is that an Enterprise was using a server at 30% of its capacity

1541
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,831
The cloud provider says I will host

1542
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,879
Computing loads for you

1543
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,927
Daikin double up Triple up those

1544
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:55,487
Get loan from multiple customers

1545
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,511
Use less

1546
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,791
Total Hardware

1547
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:04,191
Tree companies using service at 30% cloud provider might be able to get away with

1548
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:04,959
With all those

1549
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,639
If you have a factory that's only use that 30% of its capacity it's really hard to rent out your factory

1550
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:17,759
We have to do when we're thinking about pay-per-use models for industrial

1551
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,527
Is

1552
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,551
Somebody somewhere

1553
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,647
But Nina has to be the company that makes beer

1554
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,951
And this is where there's a very interesting

1555
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,023
Economy for companies that want to own

1556
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
Long life

1557
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,375
Understand

1558
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:39,519
If we wanted to rent out those Transformers to customers based on a pay-per-use Model if we ended up

1559
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,543
Providing that

1560
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,847
Former but we retain title to the app

1561
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:48,479
If the customer doesn't start using it

1562
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,527
It becomes very expensive capital

1563
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,343
Activity

1564
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,623
There are other company

1565
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:58,719
Very happy

1566
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:02,559
Pension fund know they have long-term liabilities they need to pay out

1567
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,839
So they're looking for

1568
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,143
Big infrastructure things that are very

1569
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,423
Very stable

1570
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,311
Utilization of the times that we need data

1571
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:17,151
Interesting question around who owns an asset

1572
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,199
Who is able to use the app

1573
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:22,527
Who makes better

1574
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,831
So tonight

1575
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,135
We ended up staying connected

1576
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,439
With a digital read that when we die

1577
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,231
Which as we know where it is

1578
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,279
I was getting used and who owns it

1579
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,559
Everybody can

1580
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,863
Eventually get the benefit of that

1581
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,167
Wow I think you just blew my mind

1582
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,191
I love it

1583
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:40,959
Okay

1584
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,007
Let's go then to the next obvious question

1585
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,031
I will probably

1586
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,823
And here before everyone else is just

1587
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,615
Play this too much to think about here

1588
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,639
What are the things

1589
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
Yes we need to

1590
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,943
To make this sort of vision

1591
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,503
Possible because we are still you talked

1592
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
About standard

1593
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,319
We talked about different business model

1594
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,855
I'm thinking about things

1595
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:00,159
But hey we probably need some sort of assurance

1596
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,207
Security those kind of things so

1597
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,487
What are the technology

1598
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,303
That we need to move up this nurse loves

1599
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,375
So yes it starts with conductivity

1600
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:12,191
Of course if we can't connect to the device then it doesn't work

1601
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:14,751
What the good thing is

1602
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:17,823
Ethernet to Wi-Fi Bluetooth

1603
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,383
3G 4G 5G coming

1604
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:26,783
Activities in increasing be solved

1605
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:32,927
Earlier we'd have an additional things like time-sensitive networking

1606
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,975
You end up with

1607
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:38,047
OPC UA and other ways of standardizing the data

1608
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,863
Change as well that's good

1609
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,631
We definitely need

1610
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:45,471
Both cloud and on-premise or fog computing

1611
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,543
Some people think that it's all going to go to the cloud but the problem is

1612
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,311
As we have

1613
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,615
Huge amount of data

1614
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,151
Latency YouTube

1615
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,711
And we have sort of health and safety limits

1616
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
Which means

1617
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,527
Take all of those loops

1618
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:01,343
Stop control and automation all the way back to the cloud

1619
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:09,535
Are there we need Fantastic Tools to be able to analyze machine learning

1620
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:13,375
Fantastic visualization tool

1621
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,679
See and make sense of all of this data

1622
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:18,239
Augmented reality

1623
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:23,359
Visualization tools made the cameras enabled on drones

1624
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:28,735
Stock us technologies that need to be assembled not to mention of course that you mentioned earlier in fiber

1625
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,015
To make all of this effect

1626
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,295
And it's

1627
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,831
Almost like the moon shot

1628
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,367
Hibachi it's a bit like

1629
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,391
We have to get

1630
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,415
Everything

1631
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,695
Well aligned working

1632
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,719
Very well

1633
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,279
Ultimately benefits from you

1634
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:44,095
And to be able to make it foolproof and plug and pray and

1635
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:46,143
Do you think we'll be able to do that

1636
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:54,591
I think we will be able to do it and I think we'll do that by eating the elephant

1637
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:01,759
Walmart

1638
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:15,327
Network connectivity technology available such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

1639
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,863
Stop this would work but increasingly

1640
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,959
Incredibly reliable incredibly capable technology than

1641
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,287
She didn't even better as time goes by

1642
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,847
Excellent all right you know thanks so much

1643
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,871
For coming on the show today

1644
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:34,783
