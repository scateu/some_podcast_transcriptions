00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,008
An interesting little factoid from one of our listeners

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
Our sponsor this week

Jam-packed full of goodness are you ready

34
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,352
Before this

35
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm ready but people probably have to listen to my landscaper

36
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,704
Do I apologize

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,752
First

38
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,776
We had another ad

39
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
Is Samsung artik you have a great idea for an iot business Samsung artik and easy interop

40
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
Purple and secure iot platform lets you focus on building your business rather than worrying about technology

00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
Arctic provides fully integrated Hardware cloud and services interoperability with other devices

More information visit Arctic. IO that's a r t i k.

44
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,128
Alright Kevin

45
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,432
Let's get this show started with

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
Does Apple need

47
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
TeleStaff

48
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:03,904
We can talk about the question but the news or

49
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,792
Licor remember how we want to put it is that apple is coming out with a Siri equipped speaker

50
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,840
This information comes from

51
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
KGI Securities analyst ming-chi

52
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
Quote was actually one of the better

53
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,008
Predictors of what apple is doing he looks

54
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,080
At supply chain like nobody's business and

55
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,872
He's thinking that

56
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
Maybe at WWDC or Apple's developer conference in June that they announced this

57
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
Siri equip speaker with

58
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,392
A subwoofer and 7 tweeters to provide excellent sound

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
Map of the question

60
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
Do they need it

61
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,536
Well I think they do but they need something else first

62
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
I need to improve Siri

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,496
They need they need to improve Syrian it and here's the thing if I'll be watching the the developer event

64
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,056
Live keynote which is where I would predict

65
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,360
They would announce something like this if they're going to

66
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
And the first thing they

67
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,224
Should be doing if they start talking about Siri and improvements to Siri

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
Then I would say

69
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
Chloe's on

70
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
Target for this

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
If they don't

72
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
I don't know I mean

73
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Siri is just

74
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,976
In my opinion does not nearly as good

75
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,304
As Google assistant and the Amazon Echo

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,168
I can't speak pretty good about Bixby because I don't have Bixby voice that we talked about that a little bit more

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,008
But serious just not that great it just has

78
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
Seems stagnant

79
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
It is

80
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
Not that guy

81
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,176
I don't spend a lot of time talking to Siri my husband does

82
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
Not in

83
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,504
Crest

84
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:40,416
I guess if they can get Siri cuz yes I would be super frustrated shouting something across the room and

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
I'm not sure I can help you

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,144
But just keep you very limited information not be very conversational to have follow-up

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
Iteration

88
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
Amazon Echo is like

89
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
Agreed

90
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Who created

91
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,128
Saudi Arabia it's not perfect. I totally agree with you there when it from

92
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,432
Conversational standpoint the echo is not there

93
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,992
It is something I think Amazon needs to address

94
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
But the echo has a lot of other positive that make up for that shortcoming

95
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,416
So what would let's assume Apple has the same

96
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
Model word

97
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
Has a limited

98
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
AI

99
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,303
What would it really bring to the table here well

100
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Homekit

101
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
Right homekit device

102
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
Control

103
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
I would see this as an attachment for Apple music subscribers if the sound is really good could even sell more Apple

104
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
Music

105
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:34,175
Subscriptions and I would not anticipate it works with other services are easily

106
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
Amazon's Echo

107
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,295
Guys okay with that Google home does not

108
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
Premature Google play music

109
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
Play I can get Spotify

110
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231
Because we mentioned that she word

111
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
We should mention

112
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,863
Oh yes I work for Google as a full-time consultant

113
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,191
Touch it more there Enterprise area with Android in Chrome not with

114
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
Iot devices

115
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Direct

116
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
I would say

117
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:05,151
Where we could see some cool stuff from Apple is things like healthkit integration

118
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
So

119
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,503
What if you can ask your I think you can actually ask

120
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,551
Your Fitbit data from

121
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
The echo

122
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
Where is it

123
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
A scale for that although I've never done it so maybe they

124
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,463
There isn't but being able to say hey

125
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
How's my health

126
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
But today might be real

127
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,863
Could be could even listen to see if you're snoring at night

128
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,495
I stuck so update you all I have not gotten my mice

129
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Snoring pillow

130
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Not yet

131
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
It's expected to come I think

132
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Like another month

133
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
All right yes

134
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Sew in

135
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Pricing

136
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
Sure

137
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
Sure

138
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,951
Corset well

139
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
At least as much as an echo

140
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,607
Which is 189 although you mention right before the show there some refurb units

141
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,935
On sale like right now for 130 something

142
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
135

143
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,543
Yeah it's just really almost too good to pass up if you want an echo

144
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,103
As far as Apple pricing Shores it certainly a

145
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,151
At least 199 device if not

146
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
A 249

147
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
Device

148
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,783
Yeah now it would be nice if this device actually

149
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,343
Replace stored in replace augmented

150
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
Apple TV or an iPad as a home

151
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Hub

152
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
4

153
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Homekit wire

154
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,375
Yeah that could that could work in which case you know

155
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
There's a definite Advantage there

156
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,471
And an even I could see them

157
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:38,079
You know sell multiple ones that stream music simultaneously kind like a Sonos

158
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Exactly

159
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,175
I think there's an opportunity I would love for these things

160
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:47,039
Play nicely the one thing I am sad about with Sonos and kind of missing this boat

161
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
Is there whole mission

162
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
Was to be this neutral

163
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
Kind of

164
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,463
Delivery device for the internet music

165
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,815
Tell him I'm kind of like

166
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
I don't know if I really want to see this fragment

167
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,167
And it's so much especially because I used my

168
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Echo Dot

169
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
My television

170
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Right

171
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,823
We'll just real quick related but not on the show notes

172
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,407
We mention saunas the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus

173
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Phones at

174
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
Launch last week

175
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
We're two weeks ago rather

176
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,551
The first phones with Bluetooth 5 Ashley

177
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,159
Use the feature that allows you to stream the same song over Bluetooth

178
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,999
Two different speakers I do with my Amazon tap and my Amazon Echo

179
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
And actually works pretty good it's not a saint I was

180
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Of course but

181
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,399
If you have multiple bluetooth speakers that works pretty well

182
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
Okay

183
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Good to know

184
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Celine cheaper alter

185
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,311
Speaking of voice

186
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Assistant

187
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
I have to ask Kevin

188
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,687
So recorded the podcast last week

189
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
Amazon

190
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
Free Amazon book

191
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
Echo with a camera

192
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,415
It is designed to take pictures of your outfits

193
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
To give you style advice

194
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
Is it

195
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
What's happening

196
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,959
Really I thought I thought you'd be all over this thing

197
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,007
Will you be like this

198
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
I did Aspirin

199
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,359
I'm not going to lie I told my husband

200
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,431
Right now anyone from Amazon listening to this

201
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
I would like

202
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
An invite so

203
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
I have to get your thoughts on this so

204
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:30,207
A hands-free voice-activated selfie camera that tells me what I already know which is I have no Style

205
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
Me personally

206
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
Not interested at all however

207
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,119
It's interesting to me would it do you think would be fair to say this is a

208
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,167
Product targeted at women

209
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,959
Probably end

210
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,007
I put something out my newsletter about

211
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,335
What I thought was great about this and what I thought was just

212
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Beyond weird

213
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
I think Amazon's pushing

214
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
The envelope

215
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,735
Are people ready to have a camera

216
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,319
I just in their home but this is if it's checking out my outfits

217
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
It's like a bedroom

218
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
Closet

219
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Bathroom tile

220
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
Getting personal now

221
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,463
Feels like

222
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
Those are not places where

223
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Right now I'm even

224
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
There's no mechanical closed

225
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
Camera button

226
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Which I thought was like

227
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
Please add that

228
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,775
But Amazon's been trying for fashion for a while

229
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,359
It's the flight one of the last holdouts of like

230
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
Retail for them

231
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,991
Where can I get a sense of exactly what's in my closet if I own some

232
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
I guess they're going to know all of me

233
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:31,135
I think it's a great idea for a service once it has information to be like

234
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
Hey Stacy

235
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,487
It is cold outside and you have an appointment

236
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,279
Maybe you should wear this

237
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
And my brain.

238
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,679
Yeah I know I mean it brings the assistant

239
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
To another level

240
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263
So I can

241
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
See that

242
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:53,151
It's going to get some information as you said that they don't have today about what's in our closet

243
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
Knight start suggesting

244
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,735
Items to buy

245
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,807
You know like hey your you need an update in here which

246
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,879
Tell me it is a spell I haven't

247
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,463
Yeah I all you have is Beatles t-shirts and jeans and high tops

248
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,047
You need some help

249
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,143
I'm not saying it I don't see this as a viable product I think it's

250
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,703
Targeting particular audiences

251
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,103
So it's less Universal then say their Echo products are current Echo products that's a lot

252
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,895
I also talked to somebody

253
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Who does

254
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Craft block

255
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
And she was like

256
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,831
I don't care about 4 outfits but having something where I can put a

257
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,903
A camera like a mount above my hands while I'm doing

258
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
She says

259
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
Sewing project and then say take a picture

260
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
It have it take that

261
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,095
Picture that would be really great for me from a blocking

262
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
And I thought about things like

263
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
Cooking

264
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:54,079
And showing people things for like recipe blogs instead of having to stop what you're doing take a picture and then

265
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
I don't know

266
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
Oh I thought that was kind of interesting although again

267
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
A very niche

268
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
So

269
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:06,623
I'm excited I was speaking yesterday and it bent and they're like 250 people in the audience that I said hey

270
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
Is anyone going to get the Amazon look

271
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Like literally

272
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
Interesting interesting

273
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
But it was

274
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
In fairness this was

275
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Maybe not

276
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Its fashion

277
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
And I also my talk

278
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Privacy so I asked

279
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:32,479
Yeah well now that's a fine. The target audience site I would agree

280
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
So this is 199

281
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
199

282
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
Amazon

283
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
Have to beg to buy it

284
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
Sarah now

285
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
You know you may not have people may beg to buy it

286
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,815
If you like up too soon too soon

287
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,167
And personal assistant news Samsung

288
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
Is bringing Bixby voice features to South

289
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Korea

290
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Latam country

291
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,871
Maybe it's it's getting ready

292
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
We make it two voices

293
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
I hope so

294
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,039
Galaxy S8 and S8 plus got updates in South Korea

295
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
To enable

296
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
The voice command feature which

297
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:17,279
Kind of weird selling all these phones I have one and you can't use it by voice even though that's one of the big features

298
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
Wasn't ready for lunch

299
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
And

300
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,679
I don't even know how well it works because they really haven't demonstrated it that much so

301
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,239
They did say the us we should have it

302
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
This spring

303
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,591
Which means I got about 7 weeks or so

304
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,663
I would say maybe 6 so

305
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,991
That's a good question I don't know

306
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,807
I would ask my phone but I can't do that by voice

307
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
Yeah so we'll see what happens again

308
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,487
I think I mentioned it prior to on a show when I did get this phone is got the dedicated Hardware button

309
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,023
For Bixby

310
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,631
I'm sure was you Google Now like cards there hit-or-miss for me

311
00:12:54,143 --> 00:13:00,287
And it also has Bixby Vision that is enabled right now where you take a picture of something and it's just like the Amazon Fire Phone

312
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Where you at

313
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
Scanner

314
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,895
Picture take a picture of something and it would magically

315
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:09,503
Determine what it was and then say Hey you can buy that here on Amazon for X dollars so

316
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,319
Also has an Amazon hookup in Bixby for that so

317
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,903
It's pretty limited right now so I'm dying to try the voice thingy

318
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
I'm not going to go to South Korea to do that

319
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
Sponsored

320
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,863
The other news from the personals

321
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,679
Is Google home and assistant

322
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
Is getting more divisive

323
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Leviton

324
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Amber light

325
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639

IHome

328
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Which I haven't

329
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
I haven't seen

330
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,343
No me neither

331
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
What is veal

332
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,463
Crazy but I will say it Cloud the Samsung stuff

333
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
Actually

334
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
Connector

335
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
For all kinds of

336
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,399
Depending on how this works and I'll have to go play with it

337
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,471
You might be able to connect it to all kinds of other things that

338
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
It's like another mediating layer so you

339
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,335
You could be like two hops away from a device that you really want to come

340
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:12,735
Yeah I think I don't know because I don't have any Samsung Smart Home things in my house

341
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,855
I think it's kind of limited right now in this particular implementation to Legrand smart hubs

342
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
The Simpson arcade

343
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,487
Okay I see you're at Sola Grand who

344
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
Makes

345
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
Really nice light switches

346
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,351
And I think these really cool

347
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Plugs

348
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,703
They've actually been working I talked to them before about their smart home efforts

349
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,495
They're big on

350
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Thread

351
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
So that makes sense because

352
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
Cuz

353
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
And

354
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Honestly

355
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:50,367
Most chip vendors that I talk to and most people that I talked to her like thread is a dead standard

356
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
This may be like a

357
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
Come on thread

358
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
Effort

359
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,303
Trying to build up momentum

360
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Because

361
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
It sounds like it needs

362
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
I would agree with that

363
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
So how right

364
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
Will test that out

365
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
All right

366
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
One more

367
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Kind of news bit

368
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,359
Totally unrelated

369
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127

370
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,711
Personal assistants

371
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,319
Now you are very lazy we love our assistance

372
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
Last week cloudflare

Security cam

374
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:31,583
I know for over baggage on covering like servers and all this other fun

375
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
Kind of it

376
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,655
Take it cloud computing efforts

377
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,471
Uber happened is cloudflare launched a

378
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,519
Iot security products

379
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Orbitz

380
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:45,663
And so I had to talk to them about it because I'm always in search of new ways of thinking about IO

381
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
LT security

382
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,479
And the cool thing about orbit

383
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
Cloudflare is it

384
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,807
It's designed in such a way that it

385
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
Prevent something like

386
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
The Mirai botnet

387
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,183
Everybody listen up

388
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,999
Your devices that are unsecured today

389
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
Have a potential

390
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:07,167
I'll say a potential for being secured using this so what it is cloudflare basically Acts

391
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
The way they've always worked is

392
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
You point your

393
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
Your computing

394
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
To them

395
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
And then

396
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,615
It's basically like a filter that's like

397
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,151
You don't want to go here

398
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,735
You know where you don't want to download this packet because it's from an owner

399
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
Right

400
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
So what it does is it

401
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,135
Taxes that filter for iot devices

402
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
And

403
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,975
Right now a manufacturer has to

404
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Put this in

405
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,839
And so it's not going to be everywhere it takes efforts and

406
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:41,471
It's not like if you were like a sea so at a hospital and you're like oh my God I want it I want to scare all my medical device

407
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,567
You can't right now using that unless the manufacturers elect

408
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,407
There's going to be

409
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
Hopefully

410
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,991
More adoption they're already protecting about

411
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
Is that about 20

412
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,367
5 customers and they're protecting about 120 million devices now

413
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
Basically

414
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
What happens is anything

415
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:07,583
This coming from a malicious place or trying to get your device to download malicious

416
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Content

417
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,887
That's going to be

418
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
That's the

419
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,543
So the right and IRT gatekeeper of sorts from a security standpoint

420
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Yes

421
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
And

422
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
I was really just a

423
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
Appointed that

424
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,199
You know you had to put this on your end device

425
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,759
Manufacturer eventually up there hoping to have

426
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
And SDK

427
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
And some other tools

428
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
And they haven't solved like

429
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
Like we just don't know how to solve

430
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
The problem is you're not a manufacturer secure

431
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
Thanks for working

432
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
We hope to

433
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,815
But they're they're just not there

434
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
So

435
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
That's what it is

436
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,727
For those of you guys who saw this announcement it was like hey what's new with iot security

437
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,031
It is new it's

438
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
It's actually very

439
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
Compelling

440
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,639
But it's pretty limited so far and we're hoping it's going to

441
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,455
Bigger better again I should also stress

442
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
This does not

443
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,551
Cluj you needing to actually secure

444
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Your devices

445
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
Physical level

446
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,463
Other security steps that you need to take but this is just for

447
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,791
You know this can help make your over there updates more secure

448
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
New things are talkin out

449
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
The internet

450
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,399
And downloading things if this helps there

451
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
But that's about

452
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
That is cloudflare

453
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,055
Let's get into

454
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
Real quick bit of news

455
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,175
We got an update a story that we've reported on it

456
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Weeks back

457
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
I actually

458
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Purpose tour

459
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
What disease is

460
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:40,255
Zara which is a company that makes software that connects and integrates not the devices they were behind the Staples connect hub

461
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
They worked with ADT

462
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
On their pulse product

463
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,119
An ATT was actually an investor in the

464
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,983
What happened is an acquisition went South so not needed to sell

465
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
It didn't

466
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
Sol ring

467
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,871
Basically came in and hired everybody that worked at Saint off

468
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,687
Or they offered them all jobs most of them went over

469
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,991
And one day they work

470
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,527
One day they worked at Sonic

471
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
The next day

472
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
They worked

473
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
So this was a weird deal

474
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:15,583
In the theory is that ring is going to use the sauna team to build and integrate their products into more places which has

475
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
Hasn't been a huge priority

476
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
So this suit

477
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,471
Tiles in Delaware last Friday it's a 10-count suit

478
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,799
It's accusing them of all kinds of terrible

479
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,871
Lake Perris the CEO

480
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,687
It's saying that he downloaded a bunch of

481
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,039
Miles before going over to ring that rightfully belong to ATT

482
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,831
So this is a 9 piece suit

483
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
They're calling

484
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
The damages

485
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
Real and imminent

486
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
And they cannot be calculated

487
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
IT services

488
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
High drama

489
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
Hainan

490
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,119
And they're asking the court to find that ring and hair is breached

491
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,935
Orated breaches of fiduciary duty

492
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
Tortiously interfere

493
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
The contract

494
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,287
Unjustly enriched themselves in

495
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,359
Converted adt's assets to their own purposes

496
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
This is

497
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,063
It's always tough when you work for a

498
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,623
Technology company and then you go somewhere else

499
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,695
You can't forget our unknow something that you know

500
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,999
I know it's always a challenge with IP

501
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,047
I don't know if ring

502
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,095
New how much is on off

503
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:24,959
I done in conjunction with ADT in the past I'm sure they did but

504
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,495
Balagan how deep a level

505
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,287
This stuff gets messy

506
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
It does and I will say it

507
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
Majorly Messi

508
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
Because

509
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,735
Was a big investor in saint of

510
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,343
But they stopped caring after being acquired by private-equity firm about

511
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
Other kind of home automation

512
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,207
In this field there's been a lot of legal wrangling

513
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:51,583
Write like in the last year or two so there's I control that was purchased by

514
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,399
Comcast and alarm.com

515
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,959
There was actually a suit with eye control

516
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
I believe it was Honeywell

517
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:03,359
So what's happening is a lot of these security firms are like

518
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
How to keep r i p

519
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,199
For while we didn't know what was he

520
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,247
Happening with the Zone off IP

521
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319
This is not really a sip

522
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Price

523
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:20,000
In-N-Out also keep in mind that when you file a lawsuit you got to paint every what this is your your complaint is your chance to pay everyone

524
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,048
The biggest jerk in the face

525
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
Murder puppy

526
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,752
Paste a poison schoolchildren I need that's the level of drama

527
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,592
So take it all with a grain of salt

528
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,432
Singer follow this case though assuming a ghost kitchen use on

529
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
I assume

530
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
We'll see what happens

531
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
Exciting news in the lawsuit

532
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
World Air

533
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
And let's follow up with

534
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,512
He was last week we talked about a company called

535
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
Hubble

536
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
Idevices

537
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
Skip and Kevin and I were like

538
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Who

539
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
What

540
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Why

541
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Yeah

542
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,544
What

543
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
But

544
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
Thank you Robert

545
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
I don't know if it's hafer Hafer

546
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,224
One of our loyal listeners who is sent me

547
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,528
Minion email not in a negative way but Justin

The K by the way

549
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
This happened

550
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,368
He sent me a wonderful email

551
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
About

552
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,928
Harvey Hubbell II

553
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
Who is the founder of

554
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Hubbell Inc

555
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
This is a man

556
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
Who way back

557
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
Like

558
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
Guys 1890s

559
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,656
I like over a hundred years ago

560
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,984
He holds patents for the pull chain light bulb socket

561
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,312
The toggle light switch the two prong plug

562
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
And the duplex Outlet

563
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
That's really cool

564
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,968
So I was I was excited to know this so now it makes all

565
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
Heinz

566
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,296
A sense that this company being

567
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,112
In this deep

568
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
Building space

569
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
Would buy a company that is

570
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,488
Taking advantage of all these things and making it

571
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
Even smarter

572
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,144
Anybody's ever on Jeopardy for the airt prehistory

573
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Category

574
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,192
Now you know the answer

575
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Harvey Hubbell II

576
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
Alright so

577
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,104
What's today's date

578
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,664
I feel like this is a good place to end

579
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,456
Cuz I always like learning a random

580
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
And we are going to

581
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:21,344
Learn more random facts with our guest Beyond block of Ikea Home Smart

582
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
Bralorne about meatballs

583
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,696
Lights and some of Ikea's future plans

584
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
Right after

585
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,304
This message from our sponsor

586
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,704
Hey everybody this is Stacey Higginbotham and I am breaking into the Internet of Things podcast or a message from Mars

587
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
Sponsor

588
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,520
This week sponsor is if

589
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,872
And today I have with me Ann mercogliano who is ifs VP of marketing

590
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,712
She's going to talk about a new way for partners to think about integrating on

591
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Hello Ann

592
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,528
Hi Stacy

593
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,552
Yes

594
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
Typically the old adage

595
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,136
Has been that anybody with an API

596
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,160
Rihanna

597
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,488
But we decided to make it even a bit easier and think about

598
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,840
If you have an RSS feed we're happy to have you integrating how to be a service on it

599
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:10,240
What are the interesting use cases of why we decided about this still see many people are still in the kickstarter fundraising stage

600
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:15,616
They're saying API we say come on to EFT and really think about the idea of

601
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,200
Keeping in touch and growing your user base by putting in updates

602
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Your social media

603
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
Everything about a Blog

604
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,296
Being able to grow that user base

605
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:27,648
Even using it as a form of feedback in R&D for what you're developing so when you're ready

606
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,440
You can already have a robust user base

607
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,000
Sit on it and start using your service right away

608
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,816
So what do you think the most popular way that people are going to

609
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,120
Use this new feature at these new news feeds

610
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:42,752
One thing we seen from the user side is that a lot of people like to use our news feed services

611
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:49,152
Just be able to kind of author information overload so the idea of saving for later so it's not just about getting an email or have

612
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,760
You know every piece of information go to your inbox you can say things to things like pocket

613
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
Evernote

614
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,088
Dropbox Google Docs whatever is your choice

615
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,160
Essentially want to be able to catch up on information

616
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,048
Digesting you're only getting what you're interested in being able to use some of those filters is another really compelling way

617
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
Everything people use us

618
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:12,960
Also just alerting a group we use as a test around the office is all the time we love to have in our own slack channels

619
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,544
What's going on with different news is there interesting breaking stories

620
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,872
It's a great way to kind of keep everyone informed what's going on throughout the day

621
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,152
All right and

622
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:25,760
Everyone this was so easy I actually made one of these with if

623
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:30,112
So you can actually enable The Internet of Things podcast RSS feed service

624
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,136
And you can

625
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:36,000
Tweet for example when there's an episode or your Hue Lights might blink when there is an episode

626
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,816
Have fun play with that in an

627
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,096
What other cool Outlets are there

628
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,888
Share well with your service I think

629
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,448
Some great things would be alerted when you have a cyst

630
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
Coming on your show

631
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,800
So you never miss an episode on what's important

632
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:52,128
Do you know other great things that we thought about is

633
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
Saving episodes of Pocket

634
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,968
Posting it to your slack Channel being able to

635
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,016
Bring us to work or share with colleagues

636
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,856

637
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
Stopped so

638
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,672

We're going to talk about all kinds of things today you guys are going to talk about

664
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
I'm going to screw up the pronunciation

665
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,768
Traffic

666
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,400
He's pretty close to him saying is that correct pronunciation but I think yeah I think I got it

667
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,984
All right we're going to talk about the try to feel lights

668
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,288
We're going to talk about Ikea's be with a smart home

669
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
And

670
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,336
We're going to talk about

671
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,176
Combining Smart Home Technology and Furniture and Things

672
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:33,248
Probably going to live a lot longer than the technology itself

673
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
So

674
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,552
Let's get started with

675
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
Ikea

676
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,880
And it's view of the smart

677
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
What is it

678
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,696
How long have you guys been thinking

679
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:49,632
Good journey Nike Elite we started the Journey about 4 years ago

680
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,192
We got the question come from

681
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,240
If there was an opportunity of

682
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:58,336
Integrating technology and digital Solutions in tar

683
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,152
Home Furniture range of course we

684
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,432
Answer yes or no

685
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,272
Tell me where I stood

686
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,576
Leave that project

687
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,928
Project inside Ikea Bay schedule

688
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Startup

689
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:18,048
Asking to become and get business in Ikea

690
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,608
Nothing Jordan really stalking me

691
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
Doing

692
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
What we always do

693
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,192
Meaning of we are curious about

694
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
License

695
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,056
Better everyday life

696
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:33,664
So the tallest self is not something different to to IKEA

697
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,712
It's just the difference

698
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
So we have different to what you know two bucks

699
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,088
Digital Solutions

700
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,440
Can you Technologies the weekend used to dissolve the

701
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,000
Okay so I should not think Ikea

702
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:51,584
Flat-pack furniture company I should think Ikea solving

703
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376
Life dilemmas at home

704
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
Exactly

705
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
Okay

706
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:01,312
So you guys actually about two years ago released a smart kitchen video that was very forward-looking

707
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,640
And you guys also have the wireless charging

708
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,920
Embedded in furniture

709
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,504
So are those kind of projects that came out of this small group

710
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
Y'all created 4 years ago

711
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:17,440
Yep the wireless charging it collection of Lowenstein in the April 2015

712
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,720
Actually the first

713
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,304
Collection of the first branch of products that came out from

714
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,352
Initiative

715
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,400
Now that's starting point plus

716
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,472
Around the charging in in life at home

717
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,568
What are the landmarks that you have

718
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,384
And a lot of people came back.

719
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
Said that it charging my

720
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,968
Mobile devices or tablets

721
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,392
You know you can't find your charger the cord is too short to waste the charger or someone has stolen It. Whatever might be

722
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,464
And that's what we got yours about the

723
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,512
The wireless charging technology

724
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,792
So we didn't at all

725
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Invented

726
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
Stupid gesture

727
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,144
Captain to the existing technology

728
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
The chief technology

729
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:06,080
Incorporated into our bedside tables or desk lamps

730
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,896
Made it part of Home Furnishings

731
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
Stand-alone

732
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,296
But we can help a lot of people to

733
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,136
Easily charged at home in a nice and good looking man

734
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,720
Definitely starting point for HomeSmart

735
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,024
The kitchen concept was still strong.

736
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,864
Different poster constellation within Ikea

737
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
Public golf course

738
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,704
It was more of an experimental and more of it

739
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Concept

740
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,544
That we showcase thing that email on that 2 years ago

741
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,104
We got some great lunch from

742
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,664
That project and I think yet

743
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,200
Aloha Del Sol

744
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,528
Inside the concert that we tested there

745
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:50,624
Generate a lot of pictures

746
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,440
Will we see some smart Kitchen products come out to

747
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:58,048
The good thing with with HomeSmart inside Ikea Easter we have no boundaries

748
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:02,912
Which rooms are areas of the home that we can go to or we can talk to you in so

749
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,448
Right now we are collaborating

750
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:08,032
With every part of the of the home inside a Kia Soul

751
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,080
Only businesses that you see the news

752
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,872
Go through the store the living room

753
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:18,016
We are basically working with all of them so good

754
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,808
Kitchen stuff coming out soon

755
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
All right

756
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,856
I cannot wait

757
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,928
So let's go back to the tradfri lights

758
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
Which recently launched

759
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,512
Why did you guys choose

760
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
Lighting

761
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,072
First of all we know live

762
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,632
We know the importance of life

763
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,168
For the life at home

764
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,472
We know that a lot of

765
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,008
People want to change

766
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,568
The atmospheric layer depending on that

767
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
Activities at home

768
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,408
Because basically you want to do

769
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,944
Homework around AA

770
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,552
Dining table if you want to have that cozy Friday night dinner on that same dining table

771
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,856
You should have completed except

772
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,648
Lighting setup in order to be

773
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,440
Yeah prepare for that setting

774
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:02,560
And we know that that's a huge potential in you proving life at home

775
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,840
Using lighting

776
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,680
We took a bold statement a few years ago

777
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,472
Going all-in LED

778
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,288
Autumn 2016

779
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:18,944
Meaning that we had the precondition to explore the full potential of digital lighting

780
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,504
So

781
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
Eagles

782
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,088
I shouldn't say easy but at least

783
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,392
Daily blast from the past or golden from

784
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,928
LED torch

785
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
Smart LED

786
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
Need for it

787
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,072
So we understood that people really want

788
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,912
Feel safe at home and a great atmosphere using lighting

789
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,192
So that was a

790
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
Starting point for us

791
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,800
And what are some things you learned in building

792
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:45,824
That Prada

793
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,128
And maybe even building the wireless charger

794
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,688
Call Lee learned a lot of things

795
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,528
Project versus initiative

796
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
One of the greatest

797
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,088
Importance of

798
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,368
Simplicity

799
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,672
You take the connected home massage

800
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,952
I think it's been nuts

801
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,976
Possible

802
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,000
Quite a few years

803
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:08,352
Stop looking at smart lighting work or whatever type of connected home that were looking at

804
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,656
Testing a lot of frustration on

805
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,472
How complicated is today to set up

806
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,520
And also in terms of how

807
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,824
Insidious 2

808
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
Guiding principles

809
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,968
How to make it super simple

810
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,320
People to get curious about the connected home or connected devices

811
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,600
Alarm contacts

812
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,904
And also how can we make it really for

813
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
So I think the

814
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,488
The greatest learning here was to

815
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,840
Finding the starting point so we can start with a fully connected home

816
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,656
We believe that people buy a smart products

817
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,960
Then add another smart product and

818
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,008
Suddenly God created your own

819
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,312
Rancho Park in the home and you get

820
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,640
More exploratorium edu connecting them together

821
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,200
Suddenly you're evolving towards a connected home

822
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,248
But you don't start by buying it for me

823
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,528
Connected

824
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,344
I think you're right that seems to be the journey

825
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,392
Hopefully soon to be less fraught

826
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
Frustration

827
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,928
Now

828
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,208
In looking at

829
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
The lighting

830
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,048
Kevin and I were talking about it a few weeks ago

831
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
I was like

832
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:17,728
Very concerned about security cuz I'm like yeah I hope you did this rate I hope you did this well because there's so much bad

833
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,776
Iot security

834
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,592
And it turns out you guys did

835
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:26,176
But in part one of the ways that you did it appears to be

836
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,224
Keeping it a closed ecosystem for now

837
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
I'm just kind of curious about

838
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,576
How you guys approach security

839
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,112
And the idea of the

840
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,672
Yeah I should start up

841
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,744
So thankful for having you

842
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,584
I think it's a we took today

843
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,632
Security aspects of Courts

844
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:50,752
Very seriously and we enter that dilemma with with great respect

845
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,336
And I'm the team put a lot of effort into

846
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,616
Finding the best

847
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,456
Apartments all dogs how to take the color out to make it to a

848
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
Secure systems

849
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
User-friendly

850
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,064
So I think

851
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,904
Really good job and yeah reading the reviews

852
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,768
Forever grateful that the music turned out well.

853
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,352
To the extent that we thought so real happy for that

854
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
Also saying that

855
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,680
Our intention is not to be closed

856
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:25,312
We we think that's the one of the major success factors in the connected home Easter.

857
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,616
I have good friends

858
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,408
K24

859
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,480
Seamless user experience in the home so

860
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:37,344
I think the more we can work together with with partners and and other players that use you're in a better way

861
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,184
It's on our journey for short tube

862
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,744
To make sure that we eat the open up in that direction

863
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:48,096
Okay any time frame or mechanism for this like an API

864
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,936
I compliment to give you a time friends but just to say that we are

865
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,984
Very good sir.

866
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,824
A good partner to collaborate with in the NHL standings in the states

867
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,616
Got meatballs

868
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,920
Okay

869
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
So

870
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,016
The other thing that Kevin and I talked about actually

871
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,576
After I was like please don't screw security up

872
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
Was

873
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,952
That you guys really have the opportunity in your stores to showcase

874
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,256
A smart home in a very compelling way that I think

875
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,280
Is lost

876
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
Actually

877
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,608
I shouldn't say lost a lot of retailers been trying

878
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
And figure out how to show off

879
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,912
The Smart Home

880
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
To their customers to get them

881
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,752
Interested in also just to educate

882
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:31,360
So how are you guys thinking about building that experience into

883
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
Your stores

884
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,920
Well I think it's

885
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,736
Fantastic opportunity man we have

886
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:41,344
More than 900 million visiting customers every year trust or Sunday

887
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,904
It's a great opportunity of course to have access

888
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,768
And of course we we will try to build there

889
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:54,400
Living room sets where you can experience the smart home and that we know that touch-and-feel is

890
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,192
OSHA when it comes to

891
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:00,544
The last message we just released for example

892
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,944
It's almost in that feeling when you switch that little nugget and I'm using the lights go

893
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,784
So we will try to build it

894
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,624
Intuitive any drafted station as possible in the store environment

895
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,208
It does take you quite a bit to

896
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,768
Walk you through the phone store so

897
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:25,888
It needs to be there if you want to play with it will give us some play areas and that we will also make them

898
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,472
Easy to grasp and use it to buy if you just have to grab them by in

899
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,568
Before coming to the store

900
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,640
But it's a great opportunity and we have to

901
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,456
Barely started yet

902
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
I agree

903
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,088
How to customers in the store in maybe online in general

904
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,136
How are they reacting to these

905
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,416
Kind of smart products

906
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:52,768
Do they see them in the store and buy them do they do their research ahead of time

907
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,560
What are demographics look like

908
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,144
So far we have seen that a lot of people to the

909
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
Homework online

910
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,704
Prior to the storm

911
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,568
The majority of customers

912
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,384
The know about the Detroit Red Wings before they

913
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
Sheet in the store

914
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,200
Bubbles Salon

915
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,248
Not exclude the ones who are

916
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,528
Maybe looking for

917
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,576
Just a lightbulb going to come to the store

918
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,880
And after

919
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,720
Sympathy 27 LED

920
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,792
Maybe they progressing there and

921
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,632
Knowledge level and the Curious stand there and see how they

922
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
Might get interested in

923
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
It's most likely just

924
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,288
Wendell buying a lightbulb so I think there's a little bit of a difference

925
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,104
Customer Journeys if you are

926
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,128
Curious about the

927
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,432
The Smart Homes from the starting point

928
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
Say goodbye

929
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,600
She's at people can man

930
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,416
Engaged

931
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,952
Coming from Los Angeles

932
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,768
And as you open up the platform

933
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,840
Are we going to see other devices Maybe

934
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,680
In your retail experience with your partners and that sort of thing

935
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,960
Will you go deaf

936
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:11,616
More products coming out from Ikea smart lighting is nothing in destination for us I would say that

937
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
First of all

938
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
Smart lighting Products.

939
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,736
Is in the store today

940
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:22,112
Is only the starting point we will of course expand base range

941
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,136
Get more rich

942
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,160
In this range

943
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,816
But that we will tap into the same TracFone

944
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,120
If you're asking if we will see

945
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:37,472
Third-party product or products from other vendors inside Ikea.

946
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:43,104
Highly unlikely we are quite strict about only selling Ikea parts stores today

947
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
That is true

948
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,664
That's why I was like

949
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,944
Dad in the meatballs in

950
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
And Lincoln buried

951
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,504
Delicious

952
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,880
Chocolate could be good for you to know that we are selling 2.9 Million

953
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
Okay

954
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,792
That is a lot of meat

955
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,096
As you guys

956
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,656
Build connectivity in the more products

957
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,984
And even with the tables that have Qi wireless charging

958
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,520
How do you think about

959
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,824
Putting technology which may have like

960
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,152
Three to five-year lifespan

961
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
Into

962
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,712
Your furniture witch

963
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
I assume has a longer life

964
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:25,856
It's a good answer that you bring up on me let me develop

965
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,880
Ikea Warehouse

966
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,184
Formula call Democratic design

967
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,256
Wait 5S

968
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,328
The Equalizer

969
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
Function

970
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
Quality

971
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,680
DeAngelo price

972
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,960
Those on the side

973
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
Always

974
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,080
Judging evaluation we developed

975
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:52,736
And of course I thought I can be recycled and and also what the chair just made up

976
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,600
The one aspect of course also

977
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,136
Table top cradle

978
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,672
Clicking no kick-out

979
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,744
So that's how we see the wireless charging

980
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
Solution

981
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:11,936
All the solutions that we are put out that mean you can basically mean it's almost a replaceable part that you can upgrade overtime

982
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,496
So you can keep the piece of furniture in MD

983
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,288
Work with the electronics SM

984
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,568
Usher more than module

985
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,360
When it comes to the

986
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,896
Connected products

987
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,944
We see a great opportunity

988
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,760
Using the Ikea Gateway because that's how we can

989
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,552
How you can download the latest

990
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,368
Firmware with the latest software from Mac Thomas

991
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,488
So hopefully making sure that the products are always up-to-date with the latest technology in the latest

992
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,768
Play the song

993
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,096
So why we hope that the lifetime of the product is going to be

994
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:46,240
Appropriate weight needs to be in order to being a sustainable product overtime

995
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,288
Along with sustainability

996
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,592
How are you guys thinking about

997
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:54,175
Reducing waste because I know that is a big function for you guys

998
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
When

999
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,295
You got these electronic components that often times have heavy metals and can't be

1000
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,623
Tossed easy or shouldn't be too hot too easily

1001
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,695
Are you guys thinking about programs to take that back or

1002
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,487
How are you going to communicate that with

1003
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
Your customers

1004
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,327
Yes it is something we are

1005
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,607
Lily Garden

1006
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:19,775
Boats in every aspect of the value chain

1007
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,311
Less every year

1008
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,431
Recycling fossil have programs in place so we can

1009
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:32,831
Recycled products or we use the products that at the end of life for when you are at the end of their life

1010
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,391
You have a big program out

1011
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:39,487
Alarm circularity we're looking into aspects of how we can take back

1012
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,767
Mattresses

1013
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,303
Whatever you can be

1014
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
Okay yes cuz

1015
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:50,495
I'm sitting there thinking about like my smart light bulbs that I've already had some of the LEDs that should last

1016
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,031
3 years

1017
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
Eminem like

1018
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,591
I throw this out

1019
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,639
Now I have to stem light bulb what do I do with it

1020
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,663
This is

1021
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,735
A first world problem

1022
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,295
But I think it's also interesting

1023
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:09,695
Opportunity for thinking about the LED light bulbs that you take YouTube

1024
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,999
For 25 years

1025
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,535
Ikea

1026
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,327
If you open 2 years ago

1027
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,239
20 years left on them it's a great

1028
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,031
By and it's a great little

1029
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,567
Secondhand opportunity

1030
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
All right

1031
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
Guys

1032
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,943
I'm going to start Stacy II headlight bulb store

1033
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,967
Just after this

1034
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
All right

1035
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,599
So you talked a little bit about extending the range of your light bulbs line

1036
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,879
Does that mean

1037
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,183
Colored light bulbs or different

1038
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:45,791
Formfactor so not maybe the traditionally nineteen's or what what can I be

1039
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
What should I expect

1040
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,351
Planning my smart home

1041
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,119
Around Ikea

1042
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:53,471
Yeah so first of all you want to make sure that we have every socket size 2

1043
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:57,567
Survival apps

1044
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,895
Chick 63147

1045
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,943
Exploring

1046
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:08,063
What type of color temperatures are we we should have for a home furnishing a state

1047
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,367
Today we are

1048
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,903
Having a ball

1049
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,439
Three levels of

1050
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:17,023
Whitestone going from the lights to the neutral White

1051
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,351
We are extorting you

1052
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:24,959
If that is sufficient

1053
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,311
Just play around with these three tones

1054
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,127
In home furnishing context it makes a huge difference

1055
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,663
2

1056
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,247
We'll see how we go there

1057
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:41,087
Right now I feel like there are a lot of really cool Technologies

1058
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,367
That are being

1059
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,183
Incorporate into the things like Fabrics or

1060
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,231
Haptic research there's a lot of

1061
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:53,375
Is a lot of cool stuff going on and I just be curious what kind of Technologies are you guys looking at in thinking

1062
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,423
Wow this is exciting

1063
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,447
Well I think

1064
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,983
The luxury of working

1065
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,055
Inaki I used to have our own

1066
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:06,175
Material Development Department department for new technologies and so on

1067
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,455
So we have access

1068
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:12,575
I agree with you

1069
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,879
Fabrics and textiles and

1070
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,903
Smart textiles

1071
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,975
So what we definitely take to explain that area

1072
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,023
One thing we are very hard on him

1073
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,375
Seville custom

1074
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,423
So

1075
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
Chico State

1076
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
Technologies

1077
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,287
Want to play around with

1078
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,567
So we are

1079
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,639
The Reel made for it before we launch

1080
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,431
And also we compare

1081
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,015
A solution with an analogue Solutions

1082
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,087
So it makes sense that whatever we put out there

1083
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,367
Eco bedding

1084
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,927
Cool technology digital solution

1085
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
That it is

1086
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
Superior

1087
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,815
Look Solutions out there so we are exploring

1088
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
For sure

1089
00:45:56,095 --> 00:46:01,215
Sensors and how we can get the how we can get some Architects dolls

1090
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,823
Evaluate this woman two and three times before we actually

1091
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,359
That's probably why

1092
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,943
There's a lot of things out there that I'm like

1093
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,647
Way to calm down and hold off on that

1094
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
Protest it

1095
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,231
I will have to stop by my nearest Ikea

1096
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,255
And

1097
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,047
Consume some meatballs and also

1098
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:26,815
Check out

1099
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,607
Your future smart home stuff

1100
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,399
Thanks.

1101
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
Okay well

1102
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:38,591
Left abruptly with Bjorn over at Ikea I hippie stop recording button before we set our final goodbyes

1103
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:44,991
