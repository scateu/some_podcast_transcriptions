Theories on what the next billion-dollar smart home startup will look like hard to add

40
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
What is the point of no return in the smart home that is what is the iPhone moment when adoption skyrockets in can

41
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,688
Consumers can no longer imagine going back to the way things were before

You can read all about that today at platform. You know me. Co / Stacy

Kevin

47
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
What

48
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,008
It's getting worse that's why

49
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
Oh

50
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,360
I thought we patched things up

51
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
You are right

52
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
It is getting worse

53
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
Kerfuffle

54
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
If you like it movie on

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
So Ava

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
Initially

57
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,904
Paid attention to this because Amazon and Google

58
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,976
Tennyson the kerfuffled and

59
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,048
You no longer plays YouTube videos on your Amazon

60
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Shell

61
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,144
Order Fire TV

62
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
My daughter being one of them

63
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
Yes my.

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
Now

65
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
Amazon has taken

66
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Nest

67
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
Off of it

68
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,968
Website well they're still there for the moment

69
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,880
Only remaining inventory that Amazon has on Nest products I'm looking at it right now the Amazon site and they still show the nest

70
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
Thermostat and security camera

71
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,464
Anything they've been selling

72
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,768
It's still there but when they're sold out

73
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,072
Apparently they will not be replaced

74
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
And no new

75
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
Nest products

76
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:24,032
Will be put on Amazon and this all came about on a conference call between Amazon and Google apparently and people

77
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:29,408
That were reportedly on the cauley-stein The Nest side feel that it came right from the top of Amazon

78
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,456
Jeff Bezos and

79
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
This is just getting ugly

80
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
I mean

81
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
I think I bought

82
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
I mean you bought a nest cam

83
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
Continued

84
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
I bought mine

85
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,304
Yes I did I know that you can go out to like various stores retail stores

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
If they are

87
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,632
With so many people do shop

88
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
On Amazon either for

89
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,984
A better price the free shipping whatever else you know

90
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,616
I think personally Google should be trying to work with Amazon to figure this out because I think that's going to hurt

91
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
Google more than hurts Amazon

92
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,248
Guess I never blame it when a product isn't available on Amazon I don't blame you

93
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Although

94
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
In this case I definitely do

95
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
I would not be surprised I want to say I do

96
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,976
Believe it's Amazon's pulling the plug here so to speak

97
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,303
But you know when you Google pulled the plug on YouTube from

98
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,863
The Fire TV products and the echoes

99
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,191
You know Amazon probably was not very happy cuz that hurt the customer

100
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,007
Experiencing what we have to do is with install the silk browser

101
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,079
On the Fire TV and then go to YouTube on the web and

102
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
It's a pain in the neck

103
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,663
And Amazon surely didn't like that so this

104
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
Appears to me to be retaliation

105
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,527
Well let's see how far this goes

106
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Right now my nest

107
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
Secure still works with Madam a

108
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Do you think that could be

109
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,231
If they want to continue this fat

110
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,279
What is next I would think that would be

111
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
Yeah we don't want that

112
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,935
And this actually speaks little problem of bino the silos that

113
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:01,823
Can be built in iot instead of the interoperability which I know what to talk about with him or the different products it's kind of worrisome

114
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Incredibly worried

115
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,247
Potentially worrisome things

116
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,063
Interpolated ecobee the maker of

117
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
What used to be my favorite song

118
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Smart thermostat

119
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
And is still

120
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Turn sign

121
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Smart thermostat

122
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
They've raised 61 million dollars

123
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
And part of that

124
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
Meditation

125
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
I was going to say it.

126
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
So this is really interesting timing

127
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,007
Because the press release that they sent out

128
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,079
Really focused hard on the fact that Amazon just bought

129
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Rickford

130
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
A billion plus

131
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,479
And we talked about this last week that fell to us kind of like a weird anomaly

132
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,039
I'm kind of the end of the consumer iot

133
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Play it on

134
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,439
I can see if Amazon wants to take this all the way to the

135
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,767
Peru

136
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
Buying a thermos

137
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
Thermostat company

138
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,119
Could get you

139
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
Like more of the complete package

140
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
Distend

141
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,751
Really what they would need is an indoor camera

142
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
I guess

143
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
Maybe locks maybe not you know

144
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Google doesn't have a lock

145
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
I don't know what do you think

146
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,919
Yeah I mean

147
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
Two things pop out at me ecobee

148
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
Already obviously works

149
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
Anatomy voice services on the newest model

150
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,135
So there's obviously a relationship there

151
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
Okay so their newest model

152
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,951
Doubles as

153
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Anatomy

154
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
But their old stuff also

155
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
Works with

156
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,583
Describe your other stuff

157
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Iveco beef

158
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
3 Sol

159
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
I'm not

160
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,983
Surprised that they have some backing here

161
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,823
What does it mean in a long-term because we talked about this a week or two ago about

162
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
Companies that get

163
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:45,247
Backing from the matinee phone and all the sudden a competing product is out and buy Amazon leaving the original

164
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
Company wondering what the heck just happened

165
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,343
I don't think that's going to happen here

166
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
It's entrenched yeah

167
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
And I think building a

168
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Right

169
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,887
The other thing Amazon could get out of this

170
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:06,239
Ecobee does support motion sensors and even remote motion

171
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
Sensors

172
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:13,407
So I don't know what Amazon would do with that date or they want that data but it's a proper they could get it where is none of their other

173
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Let's do that

174
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,503
Right so this is actually interesting cuz it could do occupancy

175
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
Sensors do occupancy and they also

176
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
So this gives

177
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,743
Again we always talk about this context so Amazon could do something with that

178
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Context if

179
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
Could be something as simple as

180
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631
Maybe you don't have to have it. And ever

181
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,703
Maybe you could just be like turn on the lights and they don't know what we

182
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:43,103
Beer in Hog Wild and you know watch a movie where they're on a frozen planet on your TV and it turns you

183
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,895
Your air conditioning on to make it really cold

184
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
I'd say that the same but

185
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
The hue light bulbs

186
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
Already work with

187
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
I know I love that for you

188
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
Here I am an ice Planet Hoth

189
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,695
That's exactly what I had in mind but I didn't know if

190
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Reference

191
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,791
I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure most

192
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
This is true

193
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
Okay so that is

194
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,703
And other thing that might be worth

195
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,543
About is ecobee because it has a link into

196
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Power

197
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
And utilities

198
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,175
Theater smart thermostat and kind of demand response programs

199
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,503
Is Amazon you know this week they were talking about a let's get into banking

200
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,295
This could give Amazon

201
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,623
Yet another bill that you pay and

202
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
Another facet of

203
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,719
Transactions since they want to be a part of every

204
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Free transaction

205
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,279
That feels a little out there but

206
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
Never Say Never

207
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
All right

208
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:42,239
Moving onto excited by this

209
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,287
Excited

210
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
Because Delta we talked about this

211
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,175
@cs because one of my favorite devices from CES was the Delta faucet

212
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
Madam

213
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Installed

214
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
Did you get it

215
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,319
And basically

216
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
I have these Delta touch faucet

217
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
And now they're offering

218
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
The touch faucets

219
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
Plus you can say Madam a

220
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,767
Dispense 8 cups of water

221
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
Crash of the fossa

222
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,703
So I'm really excited about this because I love my Delta touch faucet

223
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,519
$549

224
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
That's the faucet included

225
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,407
It is a lot of money but is there a retrofit package

226
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:28,063
All we talked to them and say yes about a nice ago you know they were thinking about it

227
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
So I don't see a retrofit package cuz

228
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,671
And my touch faucet was about $300

229
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
Just to give you a reference

230
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
It is a nice faucet

231
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,047
Capacitive touch on your faucet

232
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
Go back

233
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Awesome

234
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
Yeah but now

235
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,191
So break this out what how much is it

236
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,519
When is the additional expense now for the smarts

237
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
$50

238
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,079
80%

239
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,175
That's why I went back and looked at it

240
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Sofia

241
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,783
What so it's it's a lot of money

242
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
And you know they get the benefit of all of your

243
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Exciting

244
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
And this is almost I think this is exact

245
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
Deceitful touch2o

246
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
Essa touch2o

247
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
The only one you can buy as a

248
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
An Arctic stainless finish and it's

249
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Only this one pro

250
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Particular one

251
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
This one particular model

252
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
But this is my exact

253
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,335
Yeah one thing that could be contributing to the cost here I had forgot about this feature

254
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
They did tell us a

255
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,687
That's it yes and I just noticed it on the on the website for the faucet

256
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,503
You can ask matinee to warm up the water

257
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
And that's

258
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:36,671
That is an additional piece of Hardware that's got to heat up a certain amount of water so that way it's instantly hot

259
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
I will say is

260
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
These faucets

261
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:45,375
I don't know if Delta is going to do the same thing for this one but one of ours ours had like some sort of

262
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
Leaky gasket or something happened

263
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
And they just sent us a hole

264
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Which

265
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
Yeah I was like

266
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Is this expensive

267
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Remodeling my house

268
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Yes

269
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
Rip out my exhaust

270
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Ashley hard

271
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
And replace it

272
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Yes

273
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,903
Yes come on your body June

274
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
The rest of you guys

275
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
If you do buy it you have

276
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
Have to do some

277
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
Video demonstration for

278
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
The folks on the site

279
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Yes

280
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,079
Also color I should tell you

281
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
Also makes a faucet

282
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
Is madam

283
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
I don't know if it's

284
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,759
Which

285
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Again

286
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Black magic

287
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
I love it

288
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,695
Okay moving on to things that are not exciting but

289
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
Actively creepy

290
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
Madam

291
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
Has been

292
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Laughing

293
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Or just laughing

294
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,143
Not sure if this is it Kevin and I debated putting this on the show this

295
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,471
It's such a quirky story we felt like we had to but

296
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:58,591
I also want to note that the stories that we found in this topic are based on either a Reddit thread

297
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
Or tweets for me

298
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
And nobody's actually gotten Amazon

299
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
How to talk about what this is nor could I replicate

300
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Campus

301
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,575
Just happen spontaneously

302
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
Yes

303
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,207
Apparently people's madhumeh devices

304
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,511
Just random times middle of the night

305
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
Whenever

306
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,095
Just start laughing like an evil laugh

307
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
Well that's what these people have said

308
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
And I have seen even a video of it

309
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
The person didn't say

310
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
Madam a laugh

311
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Started laughing

312
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
And it's like

313
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
Why is this happening

314
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,991
Cuz it shouldn't be happening unless she's running around skills now we're going to see if

315
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
If you can hear this video

316
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
Yeah that is

317
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,047
Yeah I don't get it I just don't know what would cause that

318
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,607
Amazon hasn't spoken to anybody who is

319
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Is reported on this

320
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
So we don't know

321
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
I was thinking I am sitting here going

322
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,823
Man is someone hacking like a certain skill maybe all these people have a certain skill involved

323
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
And this is Kai

324
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,895
Benefit Big prank on them slash

325
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,735
It's funny you mention the hacking aspect because

326
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
Obscene

327
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,087
Numerous reports over the past year of people

328
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
Seeing

329
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,439
Phones and other connected devices connecting via Bluetooth

330
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
To their Echo devices

331
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,047
Even though the Bluetooth pairing wasn't on and

332
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
That seemed to be a bug

333
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,167
I don't know if it was addressed or whatnot so you know maybe this is

334
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
Some kind of hockey thing

335
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
See that's

336
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
That is my

337
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
Hopefully

338
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
Hopefully we'll get more information

339
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,919
Oh my gosh this is the kind of story that captures the imagination

340
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Negative

341
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
Maybe Google phones

342
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,063
Hahaha

343
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
The feud

344
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,695
Alright let's see what else do we have that doesn't

345
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Webcams

346
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Should we talk about

347
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
A crazy new plan from

348
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
DSLR

349
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:01,215
Yea nice webcams the network of intelligent camera ecosystem

350
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,287
It's a new alliance and if I sound skeptical

351
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
It's because I am

352
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,919
There's a startup called cinarra that is that put this Alliance together

353
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
Nikon is involved

354
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,783
Sony is involved and some of the folks that actually make

355
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,319
Devices over in China for

356
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,903
Just about everybody wished Ron and Foxconn for example are part of this Alliance

357
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
That is trying to start up

358
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,511
And I looked through the Sonora home site

359
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,071
And seems like they're trying to create a

360
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,375
A video of interoperability

361
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,447
Platform for webcams and include AI

362
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,847
So that way people who make devices don't have to worry about what the webcams are seeing the platform itself will have skin

363
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:45,247
Standardized ways to determine what's important in the video and so on so forth and I just sit here and shake my head because he's

364
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,063
He's kind of alliances don't often Works number one

365
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:53,695
The number to it sounds like they're trying to out a i the AI companies and I don't think that's going to happen

366
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
I'm with you on that

367
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,791
It reminded me and I cannot for the life of me I start googling in a

368
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,911
Back in the day when did Apple App Store came out probably here later

369
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
And the Google

370
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,751
Android play store started happening

371
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
Cell phone carriers would like

372
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:12,639
Hey there at stores actually work what's happened let's all create our own app store

373
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
And they got together to do this big

374
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,479
Multi carrier App Store f

375
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,319
I can't even remember the name of it so clearly that did not go

376
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,623
Nominate to the carriage of had their own like

377
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,695
Verizon had vcast for example here in the US

378
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,743
I don't remember what the

379
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Croup

380
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,095
The terrorists tried to adapt stores they also try to do it mobile payments

381
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
I remember Melville

382
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Isis yes

383
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
Yeah not smart there

384
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
12

385
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
Surly they didn't realize

386
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
So anyways this is

387
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,919
Keep this in your mind if it happens

388
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,991
Kevin did mention that this the guy who's behind this though

389
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Who actually has some

390
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,671
He does he push forward the HDMI video standard which pretty much is an acceptable standard so

391
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
He's been able to

392
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
Get different players to

393
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,071
Come together on a single standard that we do use today

394
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
Possible that

395
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,423
Nice works out but I again I'm a little skeptical

396
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Yes

397
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
Let's talk about

398
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
This isn't cameras but it's

399
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
Kind of like

400
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
This is part of my

401
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,943
I did a story last week on why your Wi-Fi sucks

402
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
In the house

403
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,015
Why your wifi isn't fixed yet

404
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
And if you want a link to that so you can

405
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
Go see it

406
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
Talked about all kinds of crazy things about

407
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,975
Basically your router's are getting smarter and your clients are going to need to get Dumber

408
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,767
Fish can't have two SmartThings fighting it out

409
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,815
Is part of that reporting

410
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
In talking to Qualcomm

411
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,911
About kind of the future Wi-Fi

412
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,983
They also mentioned that there really are working with

413
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,567
Five different companies to bring presence detection

414
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Motion detection

415
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
2

416
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
The home theater

417
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
Wi-Fi

418
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,039
And as an example of this I've got to deal with a company called cognitive systems

419
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
And that company makes

420
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,135
ARA the ARA Wi-Fi security

421
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
And

422
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,695
That basically says

423
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,255
The whole technology is built on this idea that

424
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,327
People walking around disrupt the radio waves of the

425
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
House and

426
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
Now.

427
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
The chips can

428
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
Tell they can paint a picture

429
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
So based on that disruption they

430
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
See

431
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,591
What's kind like radar in a sentence

432
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
What cabin

433
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
Traffic

434
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
Welcome

435
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
Which provides the chips

436
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Almost every

437
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
The really

438
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Dublin

439
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:39,327
Technology they're actually working with five companies to bring that into the home that actually gives me a lot of Hope

440
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
Ferg presents

441
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,399
And maybe even like

442
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,959
Better security inside the house what do you think

443
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:49,055
Yeah I would agree I mean when you have a call, then we just like you said the Behemoth of the

444
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
Mobile one

445
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Atheros

446
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:01,087
They are huge so that's a good sign for this technology but then again

447
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,903
Had a chair failures as well they had their

448
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Displays

449
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:08,767
I forget what the name of it was but they kind of replicated The Butterfly Wings

450
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
The miracle

451
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
Mirror something is

452
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,655
Yeah they try a lot of different things I give them

453
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,959
Credit for that answer but they don't all work out but

454
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
I like

455
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
I like that

456
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,335
Potential is a tense because of what you

457
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,687
You last said improve security and the reason I say that is

458
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,271
Unless you put a camera in every room of your house you can't

459
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:36,159
I see in every room of your house so with this you could sort of quote unquote see in certain rooms because of the

460
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
Disrupted Wi-Fi

461
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
Media weather

462
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,767
You know emanating from the router and

463
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
Flooding

464
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
Every room of your house

465
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
So you are getting

466
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,447
Information from rooms don't have a camera so I see a lot of potential are

467
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
I am curious though

468
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,287
So there's a couple things it's not a camera

469
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,335
So you can walk around naked and

470
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,407
While it may notice that there is slight differentiations

471
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
It probably

472
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
Don't care

473
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,015
And it's not like a human can see that does that make it better

474
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,831
Like it will still be able to see what you're doing

475
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
In the sense that

476
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
If they run the right algorithm

477
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
Right now

478
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
This person is

479
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,791
Beating a child picking their nose

480
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Whatever

481
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
Yeah I mean it you so you're not going to get the

482
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Detailer of a

483
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
I've seen something on a camera

484
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
Maven

485
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,751
They're working on that day

486
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:29,407
You're not going to see the detail you would see in a video camera sound like if somebody walked into your house in a room that doesn't have a camera this wi-fi think-tech

487
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,247
Text them your alarm goes off you wouldn't have a picture of that person right so you couldn't

488
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
Picture of the Nala

489
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
Yeah

490
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,879
The knowledge is important it's basically

491
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
It is just presents

492
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
It's not identification

493
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,511
But presence may be good enough obviously we will use

494
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,863
Sensors on our doors and windows and things like that for detection

495
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,911
You know presence detection

496
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,215
And that's good enough to tell you

497
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
For allergic something's not right

498
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,567
I just bring this up because it's kind of

499
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,127
It's part of that ever-present privacy surveillance

500
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
It's kind of a spec

501
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
What do you want

502
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,759
Yeah exactly it's a choice it's a personal choice absolutely

503
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Okay

504
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,343
Let's talk about

505
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,367
Here comes a little news

506
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
Yes

507
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
Across the pond or folks

508
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,303
Saracens will be happy in the UK because

509
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,655
Google home calling is now live so you can do hands-free calls

510
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
It will

511
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,007
Make a call from your Google home but use your phone number

512
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,847
So that is really cool that's added to the US and Canada which already have the

513
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
This feature

514
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,687
Even though I have it I never use it but hey

515
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
It is a very isolated

516
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,319
So here's the use case that actually has worked for us

517
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Is

518
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
We tell our daughter

519
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
Because she doesn't really have a cell phone

520
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,975
Where's the house cell phone but it's never

521
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
Procharged

522
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
So

523
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
We tell her just to give us a call

524
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
When she's home by herself and she need some

525
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,423
So it becomes kind of kind of

526
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Yeah

527
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
There's a used

528
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
Case it's more

529
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,127
It works

530
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,431
IBM has a new service called pears

531
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Geoscope

532
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
It is a

533
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,783
Cloud-based service that they've launched

534
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
Basically you put in

535
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,135
Any sort of data with geospatial data

536
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,440
And it pulls the geospatial data act

537
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
How to create a map

538
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
And it's apparently super easy

539
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
I bring this up

540
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,096
Because I am super excited about environmental law

541
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:28,192
Monitoring so I love the idea of being able to pull data from Lake

542
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,264
Maybe it's weather stations you can and see around you

543
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,336
And get like air quality data or weather data on a map

544
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
It just seems kind of like a fun

545
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Easy project

546
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
And

547
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
It says it can even

548
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
It can take anything from

549
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,040
Geotagged

550
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,856
Weather data Census Data aerial imagery

551
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
Tweets or news data

552
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
Nickelback g.

553
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:56,352
So I don't know how many of you want to make maps but I just thought it was cool cuz a lot of my iot things and like it would be headed

554
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Need to have a map

555
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
Function for this

556
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
And what am I

557
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:06,848
My favorite college is ASU go Sun Devils they're getting smart dorms in the engineering

558
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,640
Ar40 engineering students

559
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,224
Kind of sets AC off before the show engineering students

560
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,504
Requested

561
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Some students should have

562
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,576
I hear you but they got that Cronkite

563
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
School journals on there I know

564
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
I love I love you

565
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,952
But the engineering students are getting some

566
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,512
Fancy new rooms in one particular dorm

567
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,912
Some of the things were just smart usage of furniture and things like that not connected Furniture 9 that but I did

568
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,216
Didn't notice and there's a video that we can link to

569
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
If you want to see me

570
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,080
Every room gets an echo Dot and the students

571
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:44,480
I have four different custom wake word so that way each individual student can speak to the. Not confuse who is speaking

572
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,296
They can control their Smart TV with it as well

573
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,112
And what I thought was a really cool only because I

574
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
Doing laundry at college

575
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,952
She's like one of the things of my existence

576
00:22:54,464 --> 00:23:00,608
They made it so much easier for people to ASU in this particular dorm because the laundry machines are connected they sent me a

577
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,144
Bluetooth which I found kind of odd

578
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,192
Because you're not going to be within range of

579
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
Laundry machine for the future but

580
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
You can

581
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,824
Use your phone to see which machines are open

582
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,224
And determine if your wash is ready or still in progress which I thought was awesome you don't need to sit there like Wii U

583
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
I have to do with

584
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,040
Rolls of quarters because

585
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,112
All the laundry is included for free don't have to pay for it

586
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,440
And then wait and see when she becomes open they can do that right from their room

587
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
Yes I loved

588
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,560
And I was with your Bluetooth cuz it they showed him like going downstairs

589
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
Yeah

590
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
The Hub

591
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
So that weird but

592
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
I mean

593
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Apartment

594
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,336
Should offer this as well

595
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
I feel like

596
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,920
Any apartment complex that I would live in now

597
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
I would expect

598
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,968
Set the sort of feature

599
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Because my goodness

600
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
Actually I would expect

601
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
Washer dryer

602
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:58,976
Along with my June oven in my Delta faucet

603
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Yes

604
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:09,216
So I like this I'd like to the other thing is in the Echo.

605
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
Rent it and I don't know if they'll swear

606
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:16,896
Custom butt from Amazon or if they just made those with their 3D printers that also happened to be in the engineering dorm

607
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
They look really nice

608
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,344
Give me the name of the doorman everything in multi like a geographic design on it look really funky

609
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
Kevin

610
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
You try that again

611
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:28,928
Yes

612
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,584
So I tried out the Raven I'm going to call this a preview because the device actually doesn't become available for shipping and

613
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,192
Tomei to a lot of the features unfortunately we're not working

614
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
For me to

615
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,032
Test yet the company is working on adding those features

616
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,360
The basically with the Raven is it almost looks like the old

617
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,408
Microsoft Xbox Kinect

618
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,760
And what it is is it say connected dash cam for your vehicle

619
00:24:54,016 --> 00:25:00,160
Either place on your windshield or on your dashboard I put mine on the windshield and it's got a front camera so you can

620
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
Do your drive and so on so forth

621
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,768
If there's an accident or something you recapture that information

622
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:09,376
It also has a rear-facing camera so it's looking inside the car itself

623
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:14,240
Which and even capture sound in there so I was singing to The Beatles While I was driving and luckily

624
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,800
The microphone doesn't work well yet they're working on fixing that

625
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,104
So you can't hear me sing in the video which is very good

626
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:25,760
What's unique about this I mean that you had to connect to dash cameras at GPS it's got LTE it's got to display

627
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,832
Blaze on if you can see real-time turn-by-turn that occasion

628
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:34,208
You can see your Telemetry from your car because it plugs into your onboard diagnostic port

629
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:37,792
In your vehicle as well get his power as well as information from the car

630
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,888
Seated speed and fuel information and so on it was that'll work fine

631
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,544
But the really interesting thing about this is there's a security aspect to it because there's an accelerometer in a processor

632
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
In the device

633
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,592
When your car is

634
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,128
Park but gets bumped

635
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,944
Or your car here is glass breaking

636
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
Or somebody tries to open the door

637
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
You can actually

638
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,808
Get that captured on camera

639
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,392
Again I could not test that because those alerts are not working

640
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
And I also

641
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,976
Question how well it will work with the video

642
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
Camera

643
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,144
Is the first thing I'm going to do when I get that alert is I'm going to go look live right in my car what you can do because there's an LTE

644
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
Connection in this

645
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
The thing is

646
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,984
If somebody bangs my car

647
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
As you're looking for the

648
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,848
Cabin of the vehicle yeah you can see a pretty wide angle but

649
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:27,968
The vision is kind of limited because of you know things in your car and the pillars between the

650
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:34,112
Doors in the roof so I don't know if you like be able to get a license plate or not like that so

651
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,160
What it does today it does well

652
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,696
What it will do

653
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,488
I don't know if it will do well

654
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
Because again

655
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:45,888
Those pictures aren't there just yet this is $299 you can pre-order early and save 30 bucks

656
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,216
And then of course there is a service plan because it's got LTE and

657
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:53,824
Real-time connection to your phone so you can check in live at any time in your vehicle

658
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,384
Those range from 8 to $30 a month and the

659
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
The main difference between

660
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
How many times can you

661
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
Look at your vehicle or look out through the front

662
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,344
Camera it also captures everything on video and you can pull those down

663
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,648
I'm sure those which I've done it in my review so

664
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
Kind of price

665
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,512
Missy and I should also mention that there's actually another device

666
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,328
Very similar to this on the market is called the owl car cam

667
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,936
And it is available for $349 it is going to be available

668
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,240
Call the end of March the estimated delivery is ma

669
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
March 31st will see if

670
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
This actually

671
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:31,200
Comes with a Year's worth of LTE service so you get the 60 Minutes of live 24/7 video or 6

672
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,992
Tags which I guess is

673
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
Checking in on things

674
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296
Threatening

675
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,832
You can buy more data

676
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
For ten bucks for

677
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
What they call 66

678
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
62

679
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,952
I suppose

680
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,232
So that's just

681
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,768
There's apparently a big Market

682
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
Here for the

683
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
Dash cam

684
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
Damn baby

685
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,376
Popularized by all those Russian dash cam

686
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
Videos

687
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
Maybe I see the thing is

688
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,776
Even if these products do what they say I'm not in the market

689
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
Before it gets first of all

690
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
My car already has LTE

691
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,456
I mean I can use it as a Wi-Fi hotspot so the only thing I can't do right now is the camera stuff

692
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
You know

693
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,784
I can remotely close the doors on my

694
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,088
Car I can get telemetry

695
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,976
Find out how much gas is in there or how much battery charge I have so it's a toughie because

696
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:18,048
These only work with cars at least the Raven only works at

697
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,376
2008 and up and a lot of newer cars come with

698
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,168
Too much all these features except for the camera

699
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,520
So I don't either be market for this I don't know me either

700
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
I

701
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Just bought a new

702
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
New car we just want to

703
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
We did not do it then do

704
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,968
And really the only feature that we were like

705
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Play dead set on

706
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,760
Was having a backup

707
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:41,600
Which car is actually a starting this year all cars are going

708
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
Anyway

709
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,184
So I don't know

710
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
Everybody's gif

711
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
So this

712
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
It could be really exciting to

713
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
To some people

714
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
Let us know if

715
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608

Should I never touch the manual lights

736
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,192
This again as at my

737
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
The sequence

738
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
Thanks

739
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,800
That would be a big problem normally

740
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,336
S I can't always

741
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,616
Talk to Google home

742
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
Turn lights on

743
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,944
So hopefully you can please address

744
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,016
Question which I never hear anybody talk about

745
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
Thank you

746
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Lobster Pot

747
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
Oh

748
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
Men

749
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,392
Ed this is a great question

750
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:53,536
An end probably obvious to any of us

751
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
I need to know

752
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
So

753
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,376
Good good on you for bringing this up

754
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,912
So the answer is

755
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
It depends

756
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,288
Definitive answer it.

757
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,104
If you're working with a smart bulb

758
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,640
Then if someone

759
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,200
So if Google is controlling a smart bulb

760
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:15,552
And someone turns off the light switch that controls that lamp or those bulbs

761
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,088
Then yes it will stop work

762
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,392
Correct because you have basically turn

763
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,744
And this is why I've told everybody in my family don't touch the light switches in the house

764
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,072
And now people actually make fancy light switch covers that you can

765
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,096
You can stick over them

766
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,912
Billy hack off your family cuz then they can't ever turn the lights off

767
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:31,936
Switch

768
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
I'm not going to die

769
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,008
Instaff

770
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,872
Tape or you can install a Smart Switch if you have a Smart Switch

771
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,432
Google is smart enough to understand the state of that song

772
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
Twitch and so

773
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,992
It doesn't matter if someone

774
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
Turn something off

775
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,088
Right and by using a switch you can actually use

776
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:54,976
Old original be the point of contact for

777
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
Control

778
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,768
And

779
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
Tissues old pubs

780
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,328
And there are some

781
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,120
Parameters that you want to make sure you

782
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,912
Handle like they have to be capable of dimming

783
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,448
If you have a dimming switch

784
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:09,056
That's actually most of my house is wired up to Smart Life

785
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
Switches

786
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,872
The only place I have

787
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,408
Smart bulbs is where I want

788
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
Eye color change

789
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:14,944
Bulbs

790
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
And so

791
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
And those

792
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,784
Price of a terms of office which they don't

793
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,368
So that actually works

794
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,904
Nodejs Google Assistant

795
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:30,304
It also works for any smart home hubs that you might have so if you're like any automation

796
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,096
That you have those bulbs

797
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
Part of that group

798
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,656
So it's pretty much just

799
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
It's the same prayer

800
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
All things

801
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,008
If this is one of the benefits of going with smart switches

802
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,872
And I have not done that I'm completely opposite of what you have Stacey I have dumb switches

803
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:50,272
And all smart bulbs so that's why I told my family don't touch the switches.

804
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,808
Recommend to Lutron

805
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
Because they're made

806
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
Favorite of all time

807
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,672
Fees which is work like they're intuitive so you don't need

808
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,720
Educate your family

809
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
Which is nice

810
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,560
And the downside is they do require

811
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,144
The plus side is that how it works with Madam

812
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
Text with Google and it works with

813
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,984
So I feel like they're pretty future-proof

814
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,776
They work really well they're nice

815
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:15,104
If you don't want to do something like that Leviton makes a

816
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,408
Decora Smart Switch that

817
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
Is

818
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,456
Amazon Echo and

819
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
I believe Google Assistant

820
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,528
Enable do not get

821
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
WeMo

822
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,112
Smart dimmer switch because

823
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
It glows in the dark

824
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,648
And its related

825
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
That's my thought

826
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
Okay so

827
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
There's your question

828
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
Good question

829
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,304
And remember if you have a question and want to ask

830
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,120
Call us at 512-6223

831
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,680
7424 we will also

832
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
Tell you that

833
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,592
Moving right along to our next segment is Going to Be Our Guest

834
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:50,176
Rod Martin's who is president of the newly-created allegion ventures

835
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
He's going to be talking about

836
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,784
What they're looking for in a new 50 million dollar fund

837
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
Before we get to that

838
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:02,208
Let us take a message from this week sponsor Samsung

839
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:08,608
Ask for a message from our sponsor sponsor is Samsung artik and I have John Jefferies here to talk

840
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,144
Tell us about Samsung artik

841
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
Insecure

842
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Hey John

843
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,008
Hey sweetie how are you

844
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,080
So we last had Samsung artik on the show a while back

845
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,384
And since then you guys have made a few changes

846
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
Can you share with me

847
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
What those are

848
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,456
Absolutely

849
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,760
Does Samsung has really focus on

850
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,832
Security in the last 6 months 9 months and really

851
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,392
Invested heavily in both features in the cloud

852
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,184
And on the hardware modules

853
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
We have Unified

854
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
ICloud

855
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,792
Into the SmartThings Cloud offering

856
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,840
Which includes all of the

857
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,888
Previous article cloud services

858
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,472
And we've introduced our line of s modules

859
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,008
Gosh asthma

860
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,544
Tell me more about those

861
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,848
First of all the s stands for

862
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:54,432
Security offer Hardware protection

863
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,968
For your eyes

864
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:04,160
Modules which include all the computer communication in the software you need to build or your audience needs

865
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,208
To build iot devices

866
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,768
That are safe and secured in really provide

867
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,048
Three essential elements

868
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,328
Device protection

869
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,864
Data protection and

870
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
Protected communication

871
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
4

872
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,448
Iot devices

873
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,216
Sunday ads

874
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
Do the clouds going forward

875
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,776
Leaves as mulch

876
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,800
Those will be included

877
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,104
In all Samsung Smart refrigerator

878
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:27,200
What are the benefits of using the S module over something else

879
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:32,576
One of the primary benefits is rapid time-to-market we also eliminate the risk

880
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
Rolling out

881
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,672
Security including things like secure boot encrypt

882
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
Data

883
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,488
And you thought education out of the box

884
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
As part of this

885
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,816
It's critical that you design products

886
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,352
Security at mine which means

887
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,144
That you need to think about

888
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
At least 10 things

889
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:51,008
That are serious and important with respect to the pioneers

890
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,056
We create a list of these 10 things

891
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,104
So it's critical that Developers

892
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,896
Design Security in

893
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,688
The early phase of the development process

894
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,224
At Samsung we have

895
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
10 cor 10

896
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,296
That we think are absolutely essential

897
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,320
Develop

898
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,600
Secure iot device

899
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
Awesome

900
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
And guys

A new Venture fund that

924
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:09,344
Is set up by Allegiant is called Allegiant dentures and it has 50 million dollars to invest

925
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
And Rob

926
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,648
Why don't you quickly tell us

927
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,696
Why Allegiant started this fund

928
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,768
Sure Stacy we started the fun

929
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
Because we felt like there all these

930
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,608
Fantastic ideas and

931
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,144
Technologies out there

932
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,936
That are yet to be discovered that could

933
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,472
Contribute directly to the

934
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,008
Security and safety space

935
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:33,408
We believe if we can connect with the right Founders and the right companies with the right business models we can help

936
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
Help accelerate them

937
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:38,016
Market not just in the traditional consumer iot space

938
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,808
But in a variety of space

939
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,112
You know whether that be multi-family or

940
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
Commercial institutional spaces

941
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,720
That they might not even be some other what's yet

942
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:50,560
Okay so you guys have 50 million dollars this is a corporate venture

943
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:56,960
Petrified which actually historically has gotten a terrible rap but with the internet of things that's actually where a lot of the doll

944
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
Others are coming from

945
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,800
So what is your goal is it to make money

946
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Is it to

947
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,872
Find cool things that mixture of both

948
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:09,504
I think any Venture fund obviously you ultimately would love to make money but our focus is

949
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,624
I'm much more long-term view we think things take time to percolate so

950
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,440
It's much more about finding what's the next

951
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,024
Technology that is going to contribute to a breakthrough

952
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
In terms of the consumerist

953
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
Experience

954
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,864
Or a

955
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
Frictionless

956
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:30,240
Experience for people when they interact with Safety and Security devices

957
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
Hopefully

958
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,592
Udo long-term organ contribute to a safer environment overall

959
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,384
And you guys illusion

960
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
Has both residential

961
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,968
Sounds like we all know the Schlage Locks but

962
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,272
You guys also have a very large business

963
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Set is

964
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
Commercial

965
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,624
Correct that's correct so

966
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,952
Allegiant is actually a 2.4 billion dollar company

967
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:54,304
We have 10000 people across 130 countries around the world

968
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,608
So most people know us

969
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,656
In North America by the Schlage name

970
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,472
But in Europe you might be slower with cheese

971
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
And we have a number of other brands

972
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,664
Example portable security like Kryptonite that people might be familiar with but actually the Lion's Share of our business is not

973
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,504
Not in the residential site it's actually on the commercial and institutional side

974
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,296
K through 12 schools

975
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,880
Higher education medical applications in the light

976
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,440
Okay so you guys are looking to invest

977
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,976
Cross that whole Broad

978
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
Portfolio of

979
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
Absolutely

980
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
We just see that

981
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,376
A lot of great disruption

982
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Comes out of the

983
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,704
Consumer iot space you see a lot of

984
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,008
Unique design unique development

985
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,056
Very focused effort

986
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,408
That sometimes draw out interesting and new approaches

987
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,456
We also think the type of

988
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,248
People that are bringing those for

989
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,552
With our assistance with our

990
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,600
You know expertise within the space

991
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:53,440
We may be able to help to accelerate bringing their products to Market

992
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,488
But maybe even more importantly

993
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:01,120
Bring them to some new markets that they might not even be familiar with were manufacturer so we know how to build stuff

994
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:05,984
We've been building stuff for over a hundred years so when companies struggle to

995
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
To figure out

996
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
Even

997
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:11,616
You know very basic things not only are we security and safety experts

998
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,688
But we also know how to Source things we know where to go

999
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,248
Where lean Six Sigma experts

1000
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
We have all kinds of

1001
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,856
Unusual skills and expertise that people might not know

1002
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:25,952
Okay so that gets into the let's take some Nitty Gritty fun questions first

1003
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,512
So are you guys looking for

1004
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,328
A particular series like series a seed

1005
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
Maybe later

1006
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,192
Shirt we're looking for early-stage companies that have good growth

1007
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
Potential

1008
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,496
We do look at seed

1009
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,800
Series A&B to a degree

1010
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,104
There's really no limit we could

1011
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,736
Go to see but we're typically looking in that series a series B area to start

1012
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,016
Okay in

1013
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,344
Most corporate Ventures don't have a lifetime of their fun

1014
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,440
Do you have a sense of how long you want your investment how many investment you'd like to make

1015
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
Per year

1016
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
And how long you play

1017
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,512
What does investment

1018
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,816
We really don't know but I would

1019
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,864
Tell you from our thesis

1020
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,912
We think it takes probably

1021
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
Between somewhere

1022
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:08,960
In 05.

1023
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,520
7 years for something to really mature

1024
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,800
Into the space

1025
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:16,896
Sometimes brownouts or failures take up to three years for that to happen

1026
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,200
And so we're taking a very long term review

1027
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,760
We think in order to be successful

1028
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,832
We need to really work and help Foster

1029
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,672
Are these entrepreneurs and Founders so that's not an overnight

1030
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,440
Activity

1031
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
In any sense

1032
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
Sofi investment

1033
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,072
We don't actually have a set

1034
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,144
Target we wanted do it in the most organic

1035
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,216
And intuitive way we feel like if we were to set

1036
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,520
Specific targets at somewhat arbitrary

1037
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,152
And what we want to do is we want to reward the best ideas the best technology the best business models

1038
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
All right and who are you

1039
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,992
For this site there is yourself

1040
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,880
Sure there are three of us you can find us an Allegiant ventures.com

1041
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:05,280
Wade sheet who is our managing principal he also happens to be the deputy general counsel for our business

1042
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,352
And then our chief marketing officer OSHA Stewart

1043
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
Yellow Bass

1044
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,144
Carmel Indiana

1045
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,168
We are

1046
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
Okay

1047
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
Best part about

1048
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
Is there startups

1049
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,288
Let's talk about your thesis

1050
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:20,384
So Stacy the thesis of the find is based

1051
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,944
To a large degree in two things

1052
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,528
We obviously want to Foster and develop new technology

1053
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,832
By investing in tech companies

1054
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:32,928
And we also want to partner with these Founders to make the world

1055
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,208
A safer place

1056
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,512
So that is quite Broad

1057
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,816
But I can give you a tangible example

1058
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,608
Which is a company like you know me

1059
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
So

1060
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,216
You didn't know me is an Austin in Boulder based startup

1061
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:50,336
That many of the listeners may be familiar with from a consumer iot standpoint

1062
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,384
They've a very popular application

1063
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,175
That aggregates

1064
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,711
In automate

1065
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
Lots of

1066
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
Routines

1067
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,551
From your favorite

1068
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Iot devices

1069
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,135
But what you might not know

1070
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,159
About you know me

1071
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:07,487
Is they also have two other enterprise-class products

1072
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,535
One called that you know me spin cloud

1073
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,095
That actually provide a very cost

1074
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,143
Effective solution for

1075
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,447
Large companies to get their products

1076
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
Online

1077
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,751
And to manage their

1078
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,543
Messaging and

1079
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,567
Conductivity

1080
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
Infrastructure

1081
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,151
And then another one called the anomie one

1082
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:29,247
Which is essentially the ability to embed a software development

1083
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,783
On a edge device

1084
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,343
Very interesting company

1085
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,671
That has a whole variety of different ways

1086
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,439
Is 2

1087
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,463
Interact with

1088
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,023
Security devices in other things

1089
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,559
But also has the ability

1090
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
To manage

1091
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
Flow

1092
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
So

1093
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,887
People flow

1094
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
Through the house

1095
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:53,055
It's the routine that you go through it does it in a very simple and automated weigh that is very appealing

1096
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
2

1097
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:57,663
A residential consumer that same level of benefit

1098
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,967
Can potentially be brought across

1099
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,807
To an Institutional or more commercial

1100
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:08,927
And user and also that technology itself has great productivity benefits

1101
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,463
For large companies like

1102
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,999
Allegiant engine tax

1103
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,815
Got it and by the way I should mention that you know me

1104
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,607
Is actually also an advertised

1105
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:21,215
On the show okay so that is a good example so it's a very wide swath

1106
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
You guys are

1107
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,519
Absolutely

1108
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
What you know

1109
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,359
In one of the other podcast I think you and Kevin talked about

1110
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
The fact that

1111
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,735
Security and safety security in particular is kind of the gateway drug for the

1112
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,015
Consumer iot

1113
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,551
It really is because if

1114
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
If you think about it

1115
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
The door

1116
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,927
In the areas that Allegiant typically plays in which is

1117
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:44,255
Play around the door is the launching off

1118
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:48,863
For many many recipes routines robots what-have-you

1119
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,887
And so

1120
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:53,983
We're in a very fortuitous position to launch all kinds of other activities

1121
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,263
Let's start with

1122
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
Where you think

1123
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,335
Investments might lie

1124
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,663
I know that we have had guests on the show and I'm

1125
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,711
I'm feeling like we are at the end of the

1126
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
Consumer iot

1127
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,527
So I'm curious

1128
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,063
How you view that space

1129
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,855
Sure so

1130
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
I think

1131
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,927
I align very closely with

1132
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,743
Some of the comments made on the show of late around

1133
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:19,327
The consumer iot in a little bit of its demise

1134
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,375
We're obviously very bullish

1135
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,679
But I think you need to have a balance

1136
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,215
Portfolio in

1137
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,799
Perspective when it comes to the consumer iot

1138
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,615
Allegiant is very fortunate from the standpoint of

1139
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:35,199
We've been in business for well over a hundred years

1140
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
And we have

1141
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,015
Both mechanical products

1142
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,551
Ian connected products

1143
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,623
So when we enter new markets with

1144
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:46,207
Electromechanical and now fully digital product set

1145
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
We're able to

1146
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,047
Balance some of those elements out

1147
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,839
Without having to

1148
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:58,239
Bet the farm for lack of a better term on one or another it allows us to experiment a little bit it allows us

1149
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,287
To plan and

1150
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,567
Cover some cost

1151
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
Where

1152
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
Within an iot

1153
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,151
The framework the ongoing

1154
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,735
Maintenance cost of some of those things are something that a startup

1155
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
Might not

1156
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,319
Be able to absorb so for us we have

1157
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,343
Some advantages there

1158
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,391
When we look at that to my

1159
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:19,487
Adventure fun standpoint we see some fantastic technology

1160
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
And

1161
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:25,119
In some cases it may be introduced within a consumer iot

1162
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,679
Frame but we believe it's the founders

1163
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
Had the Opera

1164
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,495
Trinity or the exposure to some

1165
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,287
Perhaps institutional

1166
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,335
Or commercial application

1167
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,871
They may find that

1168
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:40,479
To be far more appealing from a financial standpoint which doesn't ultimately lock them out from

1169
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,247
Working on

1170
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,831
Consumer side but they might want to address that later as

1171
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,135
Making money as a startup is a good thing

1172
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,671
So let me ask

1173
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,463
As a consumer

1174
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,487
I feel like

1175
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
We had amazing strides

1176
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,839
It's in the last few years some very cool products

1177
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,143
Some very terrible products

1178
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,447
Even some good products that were been discontinued

1179
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
Have also come up

1180
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,567
But do you think that there's going to be a wholesale abandonment of

1181
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,895
Of the space especially as we're seeing consolidation

1182
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:15,807
Chinese I don't think they'll be a wholesale abandonment of the space I do think / 2018 + 29

1183
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,623
19 we're going to see a lot more Brown House

1184
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,927
In a lot more fire sales

1185
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,719
And we have seen in the past

1186
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,023
However I look at it like a wave.

1187
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
Saint Stacy

1188
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,583
You know the wave tank

1189
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,631
For the last couple years has been

1190
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,167
Great disruption

1191
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,959
Fantastic ideas

1192
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,751
Tons of energy from this

1193
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,823
Consumer electronics almost gadgety side

1194
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,847
Flowing across

1195
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,663
Into multi-family and then ultimately

1196
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:45,247
Beginning to impact institutional and Commercial markets

1197
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,295
Well I think it's hit the back

1198
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,367
And I think the way the starting come back

1199
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,903
And I think you will see

1200
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,183
Some mature

1201
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,487
Casted maybe not as

1202
00:46:55,743 --> 00:47:01,631
Cool or maybe not as sexy to use that work Solutions but very practical applications of iot

1203
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,423
But I think we'll bounce back

1204
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,959
Can rebound back and you'll start

1205
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,727
To see them

1206
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:12,383
Coming the other direction back in so I don't think it'll be completely abandoned but I do think we're going to see some

1207
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,407
Some consolidation in the

1208
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,711
Space in I think it's necessary

1209
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,247
I think when we

1210
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,295
Get to a level where

1211
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,879
You know skepticism is high enough when people make claims

1212
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,647
Skin

1213
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:30,047
People aren't able to deliver on those to the degree that we seen it gets a little sketchy and consumer start to scratch their head

1214
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,327
How to make loose face

1215
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,607
I think the

1216
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,655
Inclusion of the Meg attack

1217
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,215
More and more into the iot

1218
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:41,055
Will contribute to some resilience there though as they expect

1219
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:47,711
For these larger businesses you know whether it's an Amazon a Google and apple whoever it might be

1220
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,247
Making these Investments

1221
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271
You know what you expect

1222
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:53,087
You know those things to work and to do

1223
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,903
What day are advertised and designed to do

1224
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,743
Does Allegiant or Schlage look at the big consumer

1225
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,535
Companies getting into the hardware space

1226
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:05,375
Like Amazon's deal to buy ring I am think about Google

1227
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,911
Bring nest in house

1228
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:10,495
Looking at those deals do you guys worried that you're going to have to

1229
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,287
Compete directly with those guys one day

1230
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,615
Stacy I think the megatex are going to deliver

1231
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,919
Amateur product offering

1232
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,967
That is in line

1233
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
With

1234
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,783
Not only consumer electronic

1235
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,319
Expectations

1236
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,367
But also with

1237
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,391
The basics

1238
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,927
Security and safety elements

1239
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,719
That people need to have

1240
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,255
So that is comforting

1241
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,023
Intuos

1242
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,327
We partner with them very closely

1243
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,863
So we do

1244
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,143
Spend time with

1245
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,935
You know Amazon

1246
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:40,959
Apple

1247
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,007
Andina the other Mega tax

1248
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,543
To ensure that

1249
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,823
You know our products

1250
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,103
And how they're used within their

1251
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,175
Ecosystems are done properly so we're actually

1252
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,199
Excited about the

1253
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:54,783
Participation it's an accelerant for us rather than a detriment

1254
00:48:55,295 --> 00:49:00,415
And then on the industrial and institutional side what are some technology holes that

1255
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Could be felt

1256
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
That you might be

1257
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,023
I think the number one hole

1258
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:05,791
Sounds

1259
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,327
Pretty basic across

1260
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,375
You know both consumer

1261
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,679
Multi-family in commercial which is

1262
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,983
People don't want to carry anything

1263
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,055
Wisdom to get in the door they want the door

1264
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,847
Or the product

1265
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,919
You know the portable security device to recognize down

1266
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,967
So how do we do that

1267
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,759
You know today everyone carries

1268
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,783
The phone with them

1269
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,319
They may have a wearable

1270
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,367
What if you don't have those things

1271
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,647
Yet you still want

1272
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671
Secure

1273
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,439
And say

1274
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,463
Solution

1275
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,999
To give you access to

1276
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:36,767
To your bike

1277
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,071
Or to your home to your office

1278
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,375
It's a weird looking for

1279
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,703
Technologies that can bring a more frictionless experience

1280
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,007
Into all of those areas

1281
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,311
While at the same time still

1282
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,591
Addressing

1283
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,127
The real legitimate

1284
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,151
It concerns

1285
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,175
That people have

1286
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,455
You know we experience

1287
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,247
This terrible tragedy in park

1288
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,271
And

1289
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
We

1290
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,575
Have a lot of product

1291
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,647
In k through 12 schools and higher education

00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,103
To bring in so that we can really give the Peace of Mind

1301
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,407
But don't have people feel like they're swimming in
