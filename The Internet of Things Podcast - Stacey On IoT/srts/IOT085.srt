Little bit about Verizon a new Wi-Fi water sensor that is

14
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,424
This is so new

15
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,704
People would like to know about

16
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,520
Bread connected even with a i

17
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,544
And

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,872
Solutions for my Google home problems from last week

19
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,688
We also have a message from our sponsor Bluetooth

20
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,248
And our guest is Rob Martin

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,528
A futurist

22
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
Porsche leg

00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
The lock company

24
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,856
Talking about

25
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
You guess it

26
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
Doorbells

27
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,696
Locksmith

28
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,512
Before we get to all of that

29
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,536
I want to give you

30
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
This week's sponsor

31
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
Which is Samsung

32
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264
Are you a manufacturer service provider looking for the fastest path to enterprise-grade secure interoperable in an

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,664
Intelligent iot based products and services Samsung artik Smart iot platform is that

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,224
Learn more about how to leverage Arctic

35
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
Arctic. IO I actually signed up for this because you can actually control Raspberry Pi

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,232
Send stuff through your Echo I check that out let y'all know how that goes

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
All right

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
Now onto the show

39
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,680
Yeah we recorded last week a little bit early because

40
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,264
I was traveling I want to interfere with my right to vote so

41
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,616
I think we recorded on Monday we voted on Tuesday and then the show came out later

42
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,152
Does the first timer talking about

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
President-elect

44
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,016
Kevin

45
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
The Battleground state

46
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
Pennsylvania

47
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
Yeah yeah

48
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:10,048
And then just to be clear we're not we're not here to trial up or talk about politics or left vs right views we want to talk about

49
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
El potential

50
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,144
Policy changes could impact the Smart Home

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,544
The climate and so on and I say climate only because I think my old house I had 41 solar panels and have a Chevy Volt

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,336
4 years and I miss both of those

53
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,128
Townhouse

54
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
But

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
With this

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
Presidential

57
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
Shange

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
Looks like a lot of the

59
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
I I would I suspect a lot of the subsidies

60
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,672
Is for those type of things are going away so I'm

61
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
Literally scrambling to

62
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
Change my car I think

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
Logo with us

64
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,560
Another vltor need a bolt

65
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:50,240
I know you love yours and I know why and I look for used ones and I couldn't touch one for under 49 or 50

66
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,568
Grand and that's just more than I can or want to spend right now

67
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
So

68
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,408
I think what I will do is look in the

69
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:02,784
30-ish thousand-dollar range that is Alexa a lot of option scares far more options than

70
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
Back in 2013 when I

71
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
I should say four more viable option

72
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
10 miles in 2013

73
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,208
Squeezable 2013

74
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,608
3 years and it was great for us cuz you didn't have any range anxiety you need to go 40 miles

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,680
300 some odd miles with gasoline

76
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,800
Now it's I think it's 53 miles on a battery with a new volt

77
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
And

78
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,176
Even further with the gas generator that's in there

79
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,504
But I'm actually intrigued by this new Chevy bolt with a B

80
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,856
I don't have seen this Stacy I have why is that better

81
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
Why are you introvert

82
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,000
It's a little more expensive right of the battery it's also not on any

83
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
GM dealership place as of

84
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,656
Right now at least when I checked yesterday I was looking into this you know

85
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:55,776
Because the size of the battery qualifies for a full $7,500 federal tax credit currently

86
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
I just like the volt in many other

87
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
Vehicles based on the battery size

88
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
By the way

89
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,480
So if you buy something with a smaller battery mean I got $7,500 in my pocket

90
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,528
It's 4154

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,856
Maybe a spark EV or a Kia Soul or whatever

92
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,928
Any case I'm the bolt is all electric

93
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,768
The cost of electricity to go a certain distance is

94
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
Cheaper than the cost

95
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
2 Diesel and gas than the math many many times

96
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
And obviously

97
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,287
It really didn't matter at all when I have solar panels because I was creating my own electricity so that was a beautiful combination right there

98
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,591
Don't have those but I still would like to go Electric

99
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,199
Not just because it's cheaper though but because of the emissions and

100
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,271
Literally just before the election I had seen

101
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
Before the Flood

102
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:44,159
A documentary from 3/9 go on climate change and whether you believe it or not

103
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,023
I recommend people go watch it at least just educate yourself and make a more informed

104
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
Decision on climate change

105
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,375
And since then I've actually made some changes in my life I've

106
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Got rid of beef

107
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
You can watch the documentary understand why I did that

108
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
And also have thought about

109
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
The emissions that were put in there

110
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,359
Yes I love being an electric car in like

111
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
The fact that I can

112
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,223
But if I need to I can idle I don't usually idle ever

113
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,575
But like if I'm stuck at a traffic light on my car I'm not doing anything

114
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,623
Exactly

115
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,183
Nike with your solar panels back in the day

116
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,463
I do

117
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
My car does

118
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,583
Take energy which can be generated in unfriendly ways

119
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
In Austin

120
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
Yeah

121
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
For the premium

122
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,383
So that's one and I wrote in my

123
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
My newsletter last week I actually did a thing on

124
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,295
What Trump means for the internet of things and I should tell you guys

125
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
The cyber

126
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,207
I should tell you guys that I have this iot newsletter so please go to Stacey on iot

127
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
Dot-com to sign up

128
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,303
If that's your thing and you want to hear even more coyotes

129
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,399
But basically based on the things that he has said

130
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,959
And written in his like contract

131
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,239
100 days contract

132
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
What Kevin said is

133
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Probably true

134
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,639
I would worry about my subsidies and get that in for green stuff

135
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,199
Solar electric vehicles

136
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
And get that in early

137
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
If you are

138
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,855
Thing about smart cities though I would say that he actually could do

139
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
A lot there because

140
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,695
He plans on making infrastructure investment

141
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,535
So I anticipate seeing a switch from

142
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,351
Smart cities marketing from things like

143
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
OLED conserving energy to

144
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
Oh

145
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
What's what grade are infrastructure

146
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
So

147
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
That could

148
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:41,919
Be good I talk to parents are the personal details and Rehabilitation obviously you know

149
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
Something new it feels like

150
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
Why wouldn't you start

151
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,063
Implementing some of these kind of sensor BAE Systems

152
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:54,207
We'll see the other thing is I was at a conference and there was someone

153
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Cubesat

154
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,815
They're the tiny little satellites that are very cheap to produce you toss them up in

155
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,167
Into space in space

156
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,055
No Utah some up and those guys were concerned that

157
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
Trump Vice

158
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:16,735
Change the licensing agreements for how they share they sell their information all around the world except

159
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Countries like Iran

160
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
North Korea

161
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,599
They're worried that that might change

162
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,903
So the data that they share their data green

163
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Smite

164
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
Being finished

165
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
They were actually pretty

166
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,607
Bullish on a trump presidency because they said the defense spending would be

167
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Phenomenal

168
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
There is that

169
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
And that's pretty much

170
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
Where things stand

171
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,847
For the smart home perspective because I actually just had someone ask me

172
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,407
Trump's economic policies

173
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Make

174
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,735
Life worse off for the middle class

175
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,551
Then we're probably going to see people stop spending

176
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
Devices

177
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,671
At a macro-level the trends that are affecting

178
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
Industry

179
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Really actually work

180
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
For the internet

181
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
It's because

182
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
We need to have more efficient

183
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
Production

184
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
So

185
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,775
Goal of putting sensors and boosting Roi by tracking things a little bit more accurately

186
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
That's probably still going to happen so

187
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,639
Hillside on the Enterprise side

188
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
We're still going to see Investments made

189
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,271
Connected devices robotics

190
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
That's probably bad for people

191
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,623
Since we don't have policies for

192
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Ra training

193
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Probably

194
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
So

195
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,047
I would agree and I would just add one other thing

196
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,375
And I don't know the answer this question then I don't expect you to answer to either bud

197
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
I'm wondering how many of the

198
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,239
Connected and smart home devices

199
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Currently

200
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
On the market

201
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615
Made in countries where there could be

202
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,199
New tariffs and so on which could impact prices and further

203
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
Reduce demand for them

204
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Yes

205
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
That is actually

206
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
You're welcome that's why I'm here

207
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Why you're here

208
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
Yes

209
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,791
So all of the terrorist if those policies going to place that will raise the cost of

210
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,095
It's possibly quite substantially

211
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,655
Can we didn't even get into the surveillance

212
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
State stuff

213
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,215
That's a whole another show

214
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,519
If you are concerned about that

215
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,847
I'll put some links in the show notes to like how to secure your

216
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,919
Better if you're really that concerned about it

217
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,455
You're probably not buying the sketch

218
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
This is my hunch

219
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
So if you suddenly have become concerned

220
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,879
What about it then I would recommend unplugging these gadgets

221
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
And not buying anymore

222
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
Which is

223
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Terrible thing to say

224
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,767
But I'm going off the grid

225
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
That's it

226
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
Is my last show

227
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
This is it

228
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,935
Call me by phone now. I'm not even taking phone calls smoke

229
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
I'll send you a carrier

230
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,335
Iot podcast

231
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,431
Via telegram this week on the ioc podcast

232
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247
All right

233
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
So

234
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,831
Smart home things that are worth talking to

235
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
Which is

236
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
What is this this is a

237
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Mesh Network router

238
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
I have routers

239
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
Routers

240
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
Have three of them in my house

241
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
Covering tile 2500 square feet

242
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
The end they are

243
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
Basically getting an upgrade

244
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
So

245
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
It came out

246
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
About this time last year

247
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,591
That's about right

248
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
Early this year

249
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Costa Rica

250
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
9 months having sex

251
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
Enough time to make

252
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:34,111
So they had enough time to do a giant refraction what's going to happen is your Eero router is if you have them

253
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,671
They're going to get about 2x faster

254
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
Because what they've done is they've taken data

255
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,791
On everybody's network connection so when you're having a

256
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,071
Good time a bad time

257
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
Wi-Fi is working is not working

258
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
They actually

259
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,983
Grab all that and they've figured out how to optimize

260
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
Their connections

261
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
Completely different type of meshing

262
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
And everyone's going to see 2x faster

263
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,943
A big complaint with Eero was that if you don't

264
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
Was that

265
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,271
Each subsequent hop on the network

266
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
If you don't have them plugged into your land

267
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,879
Actually degrades the speed and that is true

268
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,951
You're still going to get 2x faster so

269
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Yay

270
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
Faster is better

271
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,351
And that's if you have the bandwidth

272
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,751
So if you were already maxing out your bandwidth and you were getting that all the way through your house that's not going to change

273
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,079
They cannot change that magically change your ISP

274
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
Tattoo Expo

275
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
They also did a couple things

276
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Consider worth

277
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,783
They created an echo integration

278
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,183
And so now you can ask the echo to find a device in your home so any devices connected to Wi-Fi in your

279
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,231
You're home you can as of

280
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
Today

281
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,815
This witness podcast goes out if you are

282
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,351
Once you get the update

283
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
Because I think they're doing it

284
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
Once you get the update

285
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
You can say

286
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
Hey she who shall not be named

287
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
Find my

288
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
IPhone

289
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
And it will say

290
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,919
Oh that's next to the router in the bedroom

291
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
So

292
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
You're like oh it's probably

293
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
In the bedroom now obviously

294
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
In my house I have that three routers so I've got more

295
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,391
Mark remson that it's it's only going to give me a general location but it's nice

296
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
You can also tell it to pause the internet based on family profiles that they rolled out earlier this summer so I could pause my daughter's thing

297
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Talking to the echo

298
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,911
She could also unpause it by commanding the echo to do

299
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
The opposite

300
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
So

301
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,031
This is not a great strategy

302
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,919
And my favorite is you can turn off the LEDs

303
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Your

304
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
Eros

305
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
Thank goodness

306
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:42,623
I say that not just to the folks at Euro but any manufacturer of

307
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
Smart home devices

308
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
Get that you want LEDs on your

309
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
Devices to

310
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
Show information

311
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,631
But sometimes we're trying to sleep and we don't need to see blinking lights and everything else in the

312
00:12:53,887 --> 00:13:00,031
I have electrical tape all over LEDs on some devices just for this reason because it drives me nuts

313
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Say about like a rest

314
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
All of mine

315
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
It's a multi-step process since we have so many

316
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
I suspect like short just be like

317
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
Is part of your like goodnight setting

318
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
All your LEDs power down

319
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
Oh my God thank you thank you thank you

320
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
Alright so those are the big

321
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
There's also

322
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:24,095
More information about your connected devices so you'll get data like if something's having a crummy connection you can actually go into the app and see

323
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
Hey it's not me

324
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,471
My TV really is struggling right now on the network

325
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:33,311
And it'll blame your ISP if that's the person play more it'll blame

326
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
I guess you're not

327
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:39,199
Sentence that actually super helpful that I do not have Eros I tested them I love them

328
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,295
I just didn't want to spend 499 for the 3-pack of the time

329
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
Silent music

330
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Google

331
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
Onhub

332
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
And that app

333
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,231
Destiny very similar I've used it so many times to

334
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:57,631
Troubleshoot what's eating up all my data right now why does it have a bad connection and someone say before it starts

335
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Super handy

336
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
And

337
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
In all of our news about security

338
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
All the mishaps with the Mirai botnet

339
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,591
Using your connected devices for today

340
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,639
Distributed denial-of-service attack

341
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
Not this update but an update coming out

342
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
They said enough

343
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
Weeks

344
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,183
They will actually provide in the app the ability to look and see if your devices are generating like way too much

345
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
I would like that to be notify

346
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
Vacation by

347
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
But yeah

348
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
That's a good first

349
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
Right now most people

350
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,799
Not easily anyway not unless you wanna look at archaic

351
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
No web pages can I get to your router

352
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,943
Getting around to find that stuff not + since you change your password

353
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
This is how

354
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
Reset the router

355
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,207
That's at speaking of security

356
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
Z-Wave which is one of those mesh Network

357
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
18 protocols it's wireless

358
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
Protocol like

359
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
City

360
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,911
And they have boosted their security

361
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Or will

362
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Booster seat

363
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:10,591
They as of April 2017 all wheat Z-Wave devices will have to have

364
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,175
A new level of security they're calling the S2 framework

365
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,783
So they're pushing everybody with a Z-Wave device to adopt this protocol

366
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
How to be certified

367
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
Open question

368
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
If portable devices have to use it

369
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Yeah

370
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
But

371
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
It says

372
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,791
You know to pass certification to be in the mark

373
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:35,935
For consumers so my guess is your old devices don't if they can I'm hoping that manufacturers will update them

374
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
But

375
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
We'll see

376
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,055
Yeah it doesn't seem like this is a

377
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
Well that and or a

378
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
That it requires certain new hardware

379
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,759
You know like there's no new security chip or anything involved here

380
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,879
Instead they're adding the use of a QR pin code on devices for pairing

381
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
Set me your

382
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,951
You have been proven Authentication

383
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,023
And they said they strengthen their Cloud communication

384
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,839
For all a Z-Wave over IP traffic

385
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
Social Security office

386
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
Tunnel

387
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,495
And remove other vulnerabilities through like man in the middle attacks inside

388
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
To me that is not

389
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Speak to

390
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,663
Hardware but so I'm thinking old devices could adopt

391
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,711
Yes we'll have to see

392
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:25,087
But this is good this is necessary this is actually been a standard was UA since the last

393
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
Upgrade

394
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,207
And now they're finally pushing it because holy cow everyone start

395
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
Security in The Internet of Things

396
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
So

397
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Keep talking

398
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
Real quick

399
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,911
I just noticed something as I'm scanning through some of the information that they did send us

400
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,775
They say all gateways L Z-Wave Gateway 2500 series chips

401
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,639
And all devices that allow over there upgrades are able to add as to two existing devices

402
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
Well there we go

403
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
There we go

404
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,319
I don't know what chips are in my products but I will

405
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
Yeah

406
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,279
Let's see if I can find that I have some really old Z-Wave devices I'll be on

407
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
Honest so my dad

408
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
Confident those will not be there

409
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:14,239
My hunch is because those devices talk through a hug so I talk to my new wink hub

410
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,823
And because they focus so heavily on security

411
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:22,431
I will double check with them but I'm fairly confident that that's going to be part of

412
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
The wink hub

413
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
Okay

414
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
Okay moving right along

415
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,855
I met with Honeywell

416
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,463
This is not for people who are following

417
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
I don't know how many of the

418
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,095
I wanted to bring this up because I get a lot of questions about it

419
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,143
Honeywell actually is part of their lyrics

420
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Program

421
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,447
Has a

422
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
Wifi-connected

423
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
Water sensor

424
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
That's battery powered

425
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,103
And this is and it's $80

426
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
I seen it for a little bit cheaper

427
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,223
In other places but you don't Home Depot has it for like 7

428
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
This is

429
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
Unusual because the only

430
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,623
There are only a few Wi-Fi powered water sensors in there

431
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
Do you think makes one

432
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,695
But it has to be plugged in which limits were you

433
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
I can put it

434
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,511
Credit sense makes one

435
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,815
What is $150

436
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,679
Which is a lot of money for a water sensor especially if you like I want to put one

437
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
Water heater

438
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Seek

439
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,751
It gets it as a

440
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,055
So this one

441
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
Ebucks

442
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
And

443
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
This is the cool Part I

444
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:31,039
The batteries last it's three double a batteries they last for about three years they said it's depending on how often it checks

445
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Cheetah cloud

446
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
Is no Hub required

447
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,695
And it comes with a 4 ft long

448
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Chord

449
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
That also acts as a sensor

450
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
So you not only have the two kind of

451
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887
Sensors on the actual

452
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
Box that is a sensor

453
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
But the board itself

454
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,775
Gives you like a lot of extra coverage

455
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
Cuz one of my big issues with

456
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:58,175
Water sensors is if your leak isn't where there's a detection

457
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,479
Didn't you want to

458
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,807
Guess where your leak may have to get really bad before it can

459
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,927
I thought this was pretty cool it also detects temperature

460
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
Humidity

461
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,767
So people can use it to the black wrap around it

462
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:17,375
Not where I live but where you live Kevin you could wrap it around a pipe on an exterior wall

463
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
Dysmorphic

464
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
Courts in

465
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
Basically see if your pipes going to

466
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,519
Fries

467
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:30,175
Yeah that's that's a big deal here in the Northeast so that would definitely be appreciated and of course I should say there about 8 bucks

468
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
Record and you can daisy chain

469
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,551
A lot of them together to rap

470
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
A lot of places

471
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,855
So

472
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,391
I thought that was really

473
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
A kind of meat product

474
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,999
I will probably get one for

475
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,095
I've had a lot of leaks but none of them are ever in anticipated spaces but

476
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,167
You know it's always it is comforting to have

477
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
I just wanted to tell you guys

478
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,615
What's a nice innovation

479
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
All right

480
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
Shear it's time

481
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,783
Cooking cooking with Stacy

482
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
All right

483
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,367
I reviewed

484
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
The June oven

485
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,951
And for those of you guys who are not familiar with

486
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
Let me wrap

487
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,303
Waxing rhapsodic about the June oven countertop oven

488
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,351
That is slightly larger than a toaster oven

489
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,423
And basically it's 22 inches wide it's about

490
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,215
13 in tall 18 in

491
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,751
It has

492
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
Everything

493
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,943
I know it it's it's a connected stove it's got Wi-Fi

494
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
The camera

495
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,319
So what's cool about it is it's got a camera in it

496
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,159
And a graphics processor and you put your food in

497
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,975
It's got weight sensors in the feet of the oven

498
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,255
So when you put the food in

499
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
It weighs it

500
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
It sees what it is

501
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,887
And then it's like oh I know what this is

502
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,215
I already have a preprogrammed recipe

503
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
And hit it

504
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,799
And it Cooks it and it Cooks It

505
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Perfectly

506
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
So

507
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
Yeah I know you guys are like

508
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
Well

509
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:10,527
How much is this it's it's $1,500 guys it's 1495

510
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
$5 switch

511
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
That's a lot of money

512
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,879
But it's amazing

513
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,416
Like I could

514
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:21,536
Over a dozen things this weekend

515
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
And I would say the baked goods

516
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:28,960
They're working on it they're going to tweak the algorithms for this so they'll come out better but I don't know if I do a lot of baked goods in it

517
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,032
Anyway because I could only fit like 9 cookies on their tray

518
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,824
You can only fit

519
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Things in it that are

520
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
I think it's 9

521
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,968
Yeah you're limited on size of

522
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,552
Baked goods indoor Universe some meat or something like that you know

523
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
11 by 6

524
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
CU tribute

525
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
Traditional Pyrex cake

526
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Casserole pan

527
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,256
And stuff like that you can

528
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
Roast a 5lb chicken in it

529
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,584
But you cannot do it then

530
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
Guys

531
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,984
I wanted to sing so much and everything I made in it

532
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
Was so good

533
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,056
And you have a lot of money to spend

534
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,872
And I would definitely like actually even if you don't like

535
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,712
It's probably better for people don't like to cook cuz you could just slap some

536
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:16,576
Seasoned salmon on a tray with some vegetables and just pop it in there and

537
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,624
He'll be like hey dude

538
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
This is salmon

539
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,976
Or actually is a salmon in

540
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,536
How would you like your salmon cooked

541
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
Medium

542
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
And then

543
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
It does it

544
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,680
It's got a temperature probe is all that you can use

545
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,240
To really hone in on the right internal temperature for

546
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
For baking

547
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
Yes for rosacea

548
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568
Resting okay

549
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,616
You would not I'm sorry my bad

550
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
I don't know how

551
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
Order out a lot that's probably I just evidence

552
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,624
So yes the temperature probe inside is accurate within 1 degree according

553
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
Pitchoun

554
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,464
I tried the temperature probe with my current

555
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
Digital thermometer

556
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
Kris cell

557
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,912
Either way it's still felt pretty

558
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,216
So this is like

559
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
My favorite and

560
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
My husband

561
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,824
And he doesn't like anything else

562
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:15,712
Yeah I mean it definitely is a compelling

563
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,528
Smart device no doubt about it

564
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,832
The price is obviously going to put out of

565
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
Reach of a lot of people

566
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,232
Although I mean you can spend a lot on high-end kitchen appliances obviously tsareena

567
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,304
Oven is 700

568
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,328
$50 for the

569
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,888
Doesn't do much no convection

570
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,936
My ovens in my house

571
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,472
Where $1,500

572
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,776
So

573
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
Their stainless steel

574
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,616
Are out there they are self-cleaning

575
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
They have to convey

576
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
I actually just have

577
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,480
There are Futures on other

578
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
And this is also a convection oven

579
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
Does toasting

580
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
I would say to someone

581
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,904
If you're interested in

582
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
This it will replace your toaster

583
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Which is not an a

584
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,304
But if you don't have double ovens

585
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
And you want that

586
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,168
I would look into getting this because you can do quite a bit with it

587
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,240
And I mean I would cook dinner in it probably

588
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Three or four nights

589
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,288
If I have it

590
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,480
I mean if you're not guaranteed but you're almost guaranteed to have a perfect outcome

591
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:26,880
That could make up for some of the compromises I tried to make in terms of size for example and cost and so on so

592
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,464
It's interesting the bacon that we cooked should have been

593
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
Better done

594
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
The chicken

595
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
The pork

596
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
The salmon

597
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
Kale chips

598
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,120
Potatoes

599
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
It all came out perfect

600
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
It was

601
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,008
And it came out perfectly without me having to check on it

602
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,568
Which is also nice cuz we had guests over cuz it was a

603
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,592
Inordinate amount

604
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:52,992
It was nice because I wasn't going back to the oven and checking it I was just like

605
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
Set it forget it

606
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,320
When it's play it plays a little song

607
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:05,792
I think the real potential here is the fact that the product will likely get better because it will learn overtime they will be more recipes out of

608
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,096
The food identification

609
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,376
Could improve

610
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,168
You maybe you'll be able to tweak it

611
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,264
And say you like I like my baking a little more crispy and it will learn to know that next time

612
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,848
By default it will just make it the way you wanted as opposed to the default way

613
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
Yes

614
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,408
And that's the beauty like

615
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,480
What I like about this is they took a product they made it better

616
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,296
They changed the material of the heating element so it heats up

617
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,856
Faster that's nice that got to convection pans in it

618
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,136
Where most happens only

619
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,672
That is also nice

620
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,512
And then they added this layer of Intelligence on top of it to make it really idiot

621
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
And it will get better with time

622
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,144
When thinking about designing a connected product

623
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,936
They didn't just say hey let's put a chip in it

624
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
Right behind thought about the

625
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,128
No I don't see this becoming like a huge

626
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
Widespread Panic

627
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,016
Definitely an oven of the future

628
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
Let's talk about

629
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
Google

630
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Google home

631
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
Here's what we're going to say that Kevin works for Google

632
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
He does not work on the

633
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,768
Disclosure

634
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
Last week

635
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:17,472
Last week I talked about Google home in my issues of connecting my Philips Hue Lights

636
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
This was both like a

637
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,336
Dang this is disappointing cuz I can't test it

638
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
Infinity

639
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664
It was just funny because of the Google support

640
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
So

641
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,760
Update on Google support did get back to me with an email

642
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,808
And the email did not

643
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,600
Actually help me at all

644
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,136
It was a seven-step email

645
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160
In 5 Steps

646
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:43,328
It was basic troubleshooting and meet you Stacy add share the email with me and I looked at it a cycle reset this and repair that and try

647
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,608
Turn this off and on again

648
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,888
Very very

649
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Standard

650
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,936
Personally

651
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:53,312
Credits and fortunately there was a very specific solution of this and nobody asked the right question in my opinion

652
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,104
Sub solution

653
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
In which

654
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
Someone actually suggested Ma

655
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
W

656
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,504
And Phillips also

657
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,272
Confirmed

658
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
For me

659
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
They actually reached out after

660
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,624
Podcast and said hey

661
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,464
So what the issue was is I was using Adblock as my browser

662
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:14,304
A block is not supported in either is Firefox so far

663
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,376
And you were using the browser to do what

664
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,680
So the way this is set up is

665
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
You

666
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,472
Give me

667
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
Google home app

668
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:28,384
When it comes time to add a device and you choose the Philips Hue Lights it takes you out to a browser

669
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
Ryuk

670
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Complete

671
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
Authentication process

672
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,248
So in that

673
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,272
Process

674
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
My browser was like

675
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,112
And that's what broke thing

676
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,160
You have to use

677
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,952
Chrome Safari

678
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
Feel like there's an

679
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,048
Maybe Edge or ie

680
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,888
Let's not go there that's a whole nother story

681
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
Chrome horse

682
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,960
Safari RC

683
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
They just haven't gotten to supporting it

684
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
Sew-in and I get that

685
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,384
But I do think

686
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,200
So now it works I've connected my lights they work

687
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
Perfectly it's lovely

688
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,064
I did that by setting Chrome as my default browser for the setup

689
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,112
And then I swapped it back to Adblock

690
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:13,440
A lot of people especially on mobile devices

691
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232
Use different browsers

692
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
Uncommon

693
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:21,120
So it felt like Google at some point of time should have asked that question

694
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
In

695
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
No one did

696
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:30,080
I completely agree with you I think that's a little bit of a real they're definitely area of opportunity

697
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,152
In that mean I don't want to defend but

698
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,688
The only thing I can think of is

699
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,272
Do the support people know which browsers

700
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:42,624
Are supported by Phillips web authentication which ones aren't I don't know

701
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
But that's

702
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
Really

703
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
Kind of a lame excuse

704
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,560
And I'm not

705
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:54,400
What is the brand new thing so I'm sure this is now a known issue that

706
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
You know

707
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,472
Possible if I called support today that

708
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,496
They would be like

709
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Hey

710
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
What browser

711
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,104
Podcast

712
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
Shirley.

713
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:12,832
We spent also last we talked about the Google home a little work around for basically connected more things to it

714
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:18,976
That's right that's right we mentioned the Google Assistant channel on if this then that

715
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,328
And I actually just before the show last week and tried it but was having some issues

716
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,120
And I do not have a Google home

717
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,448
But that's okay because remember this is a Google Assistant Channel

718
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:34,848
Assistant is built into home but it's also built into the new Google pixel phones which I do have

719
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:40,992
So after the show I figured out what my issue was and

720
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,552
It had to do with the naming like

721
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,832
When you create

722
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,368
The new applet

723
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,136
4

724
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:52,256
It's a turn lights on when turn lights on through my wink hub for example of using Google Assistant

725
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,280
I was

726
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:57,888
You would have type the command that if this then that is going to listen for or Google assistant listen for

727
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,776
And I was putting OK Google in there and I didn't need to do that and I'm sorry if I just saw everybody's phones and Google homes by the way

728
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
So it was

729
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:09,664
You can say user on my part to me it's not really clear that you don't need to do that but whatever

730
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,040
I got it working really well and Ashley for the first time I can use my phone

731
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,320
Very easily

732
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:21,696
And natively to control lights in my house through this if this then that Apple that I created

733
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,536
There's only one downside and that's pretty standard I think with any

734
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:28,096
Cloud-based service would you give this man that is

735
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,144
There is more latency then

736
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,192
Using say the Wink app to do this

737
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,984
Dancing with my Wink app

738
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,360
If I do it through the actual one second delay for a light will go on or go off and I could

739
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
Be annoying at times I think

740
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,224
Yes it would be nice like if your phones by your badge

741
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,528
Turn off the lights downstairs

742
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,576
Which would be handy

743
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,392
But if you're like walking into a room

744
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,696
Presence

745
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,024
Yeah they're going to walk into something before Life Goes On

746
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
That's bad

747
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,400
That's bad and your lights

748
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
Attached herewith

749
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,240
They're a mish-mosh I have some

750
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,056
Cree bulbs in fact I just bought a

751
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,336
Four packs of

752
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,384
Cree bulbs are those are not connected bulbs

753
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,176
I do have some connected Cree bulbs

754
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,248
And I have the osram lightify

755
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
As well

756
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:24,928
I do not have any Philips Hue on my network my son has the Hub and does his own thing with those balls

757
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,720
I do not controllers

758
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,256
He was supported

759
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
Rights that would have worked

760
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,352
Natively

761
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,936
Okay so I could actually mess with his lights by voice

762
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,800
He doesn't listen to show I can say

763
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
There you go

764
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,152
Ed we have one listener question

765
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,200
Which

766
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,992
Good point Ithaca

767
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,040
Missy Brian Wood asks

768
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808
Via Twitter

769
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,880
Why do smart light bulbs get so much attention

770
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
Is it a smart switch for Outlet more useful

771
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,768
I got a couple thoughts on that one

772
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,424
That's a good question it's a good question and I'm glad Brian it a steady just asked it on Twitter just this morning before the show so good

773
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,448
Number one

774
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
I think about it in terms of

775
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,544
Convenience choice

776
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,360
And cost Queen Elsa goes three things the three C's

777
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:22,016
There's no question a Smart Switch or an outlet is useful I have some of them might have a couple of smart outlets for example and then the way

778
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,552
Wink relay is a Smart Switch

779
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
That added smarts

780
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,392
To a non smart pot which is great

781
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:32,000
Switches typically cost roughly 40 50 bucks or more

782
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,304
Rapper that wears a bulb connected

783
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,352
Can be had for less than 20

784
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,144
I'm so there's a cost involved

785
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,216
There's also convenience I mean people listen to show

786
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
Probably okay with some

787
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
Swapping out switches and

788
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
Playing with electrical wires

789
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,920
Shorting out the HVAC systems like I've done but it's a lot easier to just

790
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
Changeable

791
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
Quite honestly so

792
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,784
For folks who don't want to mess with electricity

793
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,088
About is easier

794
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,904
And then a switch add smart stew

795
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,440
Dogs yes but

796
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:06,304
Some bulbs actually have more functionality just because they are smart bulbs whereas

797
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,864
You know that she was a pretty simple changing the colors

798
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,960
On your Hue bulbs are not going to really easily do that with most witches

799
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,240
That's one example

800
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,032
I also have those

801
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,824
Balls that are

802
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
Tunable

803
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
To soft light

804
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,176
Soft white rather or daylight

805
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,992
Again not easily done with just a switch

806
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
So I think you get more

807
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,344
Choice with a smart dog those are my

808
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,136
Three of the top of my head

809
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,440
Okay and mine are a little different

810
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
It depends kind of situation so

811
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,560
A lot of my lights

812
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
Our I don't have a lot of

813
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:45,216
Clamps so if I'm changing out all the light bulbs in my kitchen is actually cheaper

814
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,496
For me to install the switch

815
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Install

816
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,128
And because that is a room where we lie

817
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,200
I only want certain functionality I don't need

818
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,992
The colors to change in my room

819
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,528
Are in my kitchen

820
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,576
So for their I'm like

821
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,136
A switch makes sense cuz I'm just going to dim it up

822
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
Quit

823
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,208
If you want the tunable wipes

824
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
There is no dimmer

825
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,280
There's no Smart Switch that can offer

826
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
Today

827
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,072
And they're made

828
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,912
The other thing to know is with a light bulb

829
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,472
You lose the ability to turn off your switch

830
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
Which if your label is connect

831
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,824
Because when you do you break the light bulb

832
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
It's off

833
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,128
So

834
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
4

835
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,688
Practical rooms

836
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,736
That's kind of my thought is

837
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,784
Uno swap out your switch for your mean

838
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
Jermaine lighting

839
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,392
Four lamps I think a connected

840
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,720
Light bulb actually is really interesting because

841
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,048
It's fun to play with colors and that sort of thing

842
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,352
So that's kind of where

843
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,936
I've come down on it so swap out your switch if you can

844
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,728
I really like Lutron

845
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
I'm just going to tell you

846
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,056
WeMo has a Wi-Fi switch

847
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,848
I was switched at

848
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
Is

849
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,432
Off on but it is not

850
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
Dimmable

851
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,248
And people are really iffy

852
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
That's

853
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,064
Most people do not

854
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,600
The best solution

855
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
And there's a couple new

856
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
Wifi powered light switches like

857
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,232
Sun Life is one

858
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,584
Are supposedly better but I haven't tried them there's the wink relay

859
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
But also no

860
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,656
If you put a connected switch in

861
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,216
You cannot have a connected

862
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Light bulb

863
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,288
So you can't have a Lutron light

864
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
With a connected

865
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
Philips hue light bulb

866
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
For example

867
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
You basically lose

868
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,784
Those are my thoughts I think

869
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,064
It's not a clear-cut answer

870
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:42,720
No no it's these definitely not a perfect example that is I have far more lamps in my house than you do is what

871
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
From the sounds of it

872
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
Three lamps

873
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,376
Yeah we have a lot of lamps and

874
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,424
You know we just made sense to go with

875
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,776
Smart bulbs for those I'm not saying smart bulbs is a better choice for everybody who sang

876
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,568
In my circumstances made Morse

877
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,592
Yeah and you

878
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
Yep

879
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
Baidu

880
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
So yes

881
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,272
It depends

882
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,064
But there you got a little bit I think

883
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
So you can

884
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,904
What do I want to spend my 50

885
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
All right

886
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,768
That is a lot to show for us this week

887
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,352
Let us prepare for our guests Rob Martens

888
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,168
Who is a futuristic Schlage we're going to talk about locks

889
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:28,800
And before we do that we're going to have a message from our sponsor

890
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:35,200
Hey everyone this is Stacy and we are breaking into podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Bluetooth

891
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:39,296
Set a timer about this we have the director of marketing at the Bluetooth Sig

892
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
Caddyshack

893
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,904
I believe you are here this week to tell us about the imagine blue

894
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
What are those

895
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
ICC thanks for having me

896
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
Imagine blue Awards

897
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:52,864
Really high like the work and imaginations of readers

898
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,912
Of designers and for students

899
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,704
Who are using Bluetooth technology

900
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,520
To really push the boundaries of Wireless connect

901
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:03,872
Tivity we've seen things from Smart light bulb with built-in mesh technology

902
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,920
To automatic gear shift for bicycle

903
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,200
Spiritual words

904
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,736
Sissy are two categories

905
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,760
Prototype in

906
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
Student

907
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,296
With a Chance

908
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,112
To win cash prizes ranging from $5,000 to

909
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
The $10,000

910
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,952
So tell me more about the divisions and the price

911
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,256
The perfect category is for innovation

912
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
Markets

913
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,352
I want all the student category is for individuals

914
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,144
School college

915
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,912
Postgraduate

916
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:32,544
It's cool to have an idea concept or maybe even a working prototype on how life can be better with

917
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,592
The Prototype finalists

918
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
They'll be invited

919
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,920
World in March of next year

920
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:42,784
Where they can showcase their entry at our booth that'll put them in front of Developers

921
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,112

00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,824
Probably really large lock

980
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,848
Company that you guys have

981
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,152
So hi Rob how are you doing

00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,344
I have you on the show because I love the title futurist

985
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,648
And I'm happy to talk to anybody who is a few

986
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,464
What do you do in your day-to-day life

987
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
Actually

988
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,560
Well my number one role Within

989
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,352
Wag and Allegiant is

990
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,888
The challenge old ways of thinking

991
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:08,960
So I spend a lot of time looking at new tax

992
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:13,312
New trends new processes and trying to figure out how to apply it

993
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
Back

994
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,128
To our products to benefit our

995
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
Consumer

996
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:22,784
Kenneth Lee to a big part of my job is to try and demystify things like the iot

997
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,368
Let's get started on that for your business

998
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,208
What is an actually we should stress that your business is both residential

999
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,048
Multifamily and Commercial so that's that's everybody

1000
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,584
For your business

1001
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
How are you guys

1002
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,936
Looking at the Internet of Things how do you demystify that for your

1003
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:46,080
Wilshire obviously you know a very complex space but probably the fast

1004
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
This growing

1005
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:50,432
Megatrend that that we see within our business

1006
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:54,272
Probably you know the biggest thing we're trying to do right now

1007
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,064
Is improve that customers

1008
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,880
Experience on the residential side of

1009
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,648
The market

1010
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,952
Things are really honky right now

1011
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:06,816
So when you buy things off the shelf some people are having experience

1012
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,608
Is where you really need to be at a key

1013
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,448
In order to I get the product to work the way that you wanted to work so

1014
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,288
Our focus is how can we improve that in quite frankly

1015
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,568
Falling to the Cadence

1016
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,848
Somebody is today

1017
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,640
Rather than being an interrupter

1018
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,432
I like it

1019
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:29,088
So let's talk about you guys and you're connected locks cuz when I first started my smart home dirty way back into

1020
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
2012

1021
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,952
I think I had a choice of like a Z-Wave or maybe it was a zigbee lock from

1022
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
You guys

1023
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,000
Where are y'all today

1024
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:41,376
Talking purely about the residential segment here for a second

1025
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,960
We came out with our first connected lock back in 2008

1026
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:48,288
And this was a little early was called slay bling

1027
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,080
And that was

1028
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,360
AZ wave

1029
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
Connected

1030
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,919
Keypad deadbolt

1031
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,479
And so you would be able to

1032
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:02,879
If still have to solve actuated another word that didn't have a motor you would get the permission to drop a pin and you could turn the deadbolt

1033
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,415
I'll let people in or out

1034
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,207
But since then there's been

1035
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,231
Huge growth

1036
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:07,999
So

1037
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,303
We have a whole variety of

1038
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
D-wave lovers

1039
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,423
Z-Wave touchscreen deadbolts that have keypad

1040
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,959
MNR latest

1041
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:20,799
Creation has been what we call the Schlage sense

1042
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,615
Which is the Bluetooth low energy lock

1043
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:27,967
Right now most people associate the Schlage sense with Apple homekit

1044
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,247
But in reality

1045
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,783
Normal BP

1046
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,807
Expanded out

1047
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,623
The big differentiator between our

1048
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:38,207
Z-Wave products sets in RB Ali-A products at

1049
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,511
Is that at the ble products

1050
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,303
Ship with an application

1051
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,119
And the big deal about that

1052
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,143
Is that

1053
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,167
Before

1054
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,495
We have all kinds of Technology built into these locks

1055
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,055
Accelerometers in the example

1056
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,847
That can tell you the difference

1057
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,199
In the fourth profile of a Kickin at M purse has a dorsal

1058
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,479
For example

1059
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,527
Or we can set it

1060
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
Such that for example my son is

1061
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Always

1062
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,903
Late for the bus in your runs out the front door

1063
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
Never locked the door behind them

1064
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,231
And so we can set it so

1065
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:17,375
30 seconds after the door's been open and up to 4 minutes after it can Auto throw the bolt for you

1066
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,655
This

1067
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,215
Graphical interface just makes

1068
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,287
Easier a better experience to program the law

1069
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,359
Programme schedules in the event that you have

1070
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,895
A dog walker coming

1071
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,455
I'm you have any scheduled events

1072
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,503
And all that good stuff

1073
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,807
All of our touch screen

1074
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,575
Deadbolt

1075
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
Have the penis keypad

1076
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,439
Which is fingerprint resistant

1077
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:47,583
They saw the heat and cold and all in a survive all the sledgehammer attack and all the crazy stuff you'd expect

1078
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,351
Brea

1079
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,631
A grade 1 lock

1080
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
To survive

1081
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,239
Let's talk about security and physical access in

1082
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
Control

1083
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,543
Access control I guess

1084
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,103
A lot of companies in the lock space

1085
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,455
Or who are getting into the locked space are viewing it as kind of a

1086
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:09,855
As a home security play or possibly as a Services kind of play so there's like the August access serve

1087
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,135
Service which is really interesting

1088
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,695
Where do you think Schlage is going to kind of

1089
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:20,095
I guess evolve in this world are you guys going to just be better locks which is totally fine are you guys going to try to move into some sort of

1090
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:20,863
Other offer

1091
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,191
No I think you're going to see us evolve in

1092
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
And I think it

1093
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,775
Really fantastic the whole crowdfunding

1094
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:31,615
A movement although you know we've seen some crazy things come out right

1095
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,663
Not all of them very useful

1096
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:37,503
But interesting ideas that really helped to transform the station

1097
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,087
Created a lot of opportunities within the category itself

1098
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,623
I'd say the most important

1099
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,927
Singing in our North Star is worth

1100
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,207
Security company first

1101
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:52,607
And we believe there's a small group of home automation Enthusiast made out of small group

1102
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,423
You're certainly not as big as the main screen

1103
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,191
We Believe

1104
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:59,775
That there is a mainstream underserved

1105
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:00,799
Gru

1106
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,103
People who

1107
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,663
Are really shopping first and foremost

1108
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,687
Or

1109
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
Security

1110
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,479
Analogue

1111
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,575
In a lock that is going to perform as

1112
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,879
They would expect it to historically

1113
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,695
But then has this incremental

1114
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
Benefit

1115
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:24,607
I'm in that could be connected it might just be the highest got a keypad and I don't have to carry he with me

1116
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,887
But I think it's

1117
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:29,727
Going to be an evolution towards enhancing

1118
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,519
A better outcome

1119
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,799
For the user

1120
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,847
Those business cases

1121
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,687
For the end users can be pretty complex today

1122
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,479
You see a lot of people

1123
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,759
Who want to connect

1124
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,807
Different things within the

1125
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:47,135
Home and what we're experts at is identifying

1126
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,463
Which ones are those are safe to do

1127
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,863
Which ones do you really need to think about more carefully before you do it so example of one that we would suggest

1128
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,655
Hey Carson

1129
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,935
You know who should be

1130
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,007
You know some caution here

1131
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,567
Would be proximity lock and unlock

1132
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,871
So for example

1133
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,431
People want the Star Trek to where you want to walk up

1134
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,759
Have the door recognize you and unlocked for your convenience

1135
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039
Walt

1136
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,831
We see some gas

1137
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,391
In terms of the technology

1138
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,439
Where is identifying Where You Are

1139
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,743
Necessarily in proximity to the lock

1140
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,535
Depending on where your garage

1141
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
Example

1142
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:31,423
Time you may be parallel to the lock or inside the home

1143
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,751
And may inadvertently trigger The Loft open

1144
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
And

1145
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,847
It may be an infant a small a small chance

1146
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:45,503
But you really have to ask yourself if your son or daughter or loved one is on the other side of the door and there's a

1147
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,783
After Decline

1148
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,343
And it unlocks and they hear it

1149
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,135
Is that worth it

1150
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,183
Sure and what I think about locks

1151
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:56,767
That's a space where there might be some liability issues to

1152
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,607
If someone wanted to pursue them and I don't know if that kind of

1153
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,911
Obviously if you are a lock brand

1154
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,471
That's your bread and butter is that your locked

1155
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,775
Or unlocked at the person's will right

1156
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,311
So having these

1157
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,615
Potential for mistakes or uncertainty

1158
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:15,199
Feels like it could be both a liability and a brand Issue 4

1159
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:18,527
Are you guys how do you even innovate if you've got that kind of

1160
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,063
A Culture of Fear there

1161
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,343
I think

1162
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,135
The easiest way to describe it

1163
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,183
To say there's always a balance

1164
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,463
Between physical

1165
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,255
Security inconvenience

1166
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,583
It's always try to do is educate the consumer on

1167
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,119
This is the most secure element

1168
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:39,263
And hear some choices that you have and you can diminish a little bit of your security and gain some convenience there

1169
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,055
But understand what it is

1170
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
In the balance that you're trying to

1171
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
Get there

1172
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:46,943
So this is just a physical like locking and unlocking

1173
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
King future

1174
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,783
But once you put something online so with your Bluetooth

1175
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,807
Lock for example

1176
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,903
Or maybe if i integrated my zwave locks to a wink hub

1177
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:02,303
Suddenly I am now has thrown in another partner for you guys that you may or may not know about and I've also

1178
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,095
Open up another Avenue of attacked

1179
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,399
To the Internet so how are you guys thinking about

1180
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,423
Could have internet

1181
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,727
Absolutely enough

1182
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,543
The big question or one of the big question

1183
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,311
For me

1184
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,615
It says you're only strong as your weakest link

1185
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,687
Sounds cliche but it's absolutely the truth and so

1186
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,759
We spend a lot of time with the Hub providers

1187
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,295
And with our partners

1188
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,575
Identifying

1189
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,623
We're through that chain

1190
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,903
Routine

1191
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:30,207
Or robot or depending on your

1192
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:33,535
You know when you're on your vendor they all have different names for it

1193
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,607
Which ones will be allowed and which ones will not

1194
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
The allowed

1195
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,935
And quite frankly we asked

1196
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,239
Spell subject matter experts for them on

1197
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
What is

1198
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,567
Appropriate and what is not appropriate

1199
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,591
So

1200
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,663
Pumpkin is a great example could you have your homekit lock

1201
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:54,527
The homekit lock profile by August

1202
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,831
And they actually recently had a

1203
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:03,487
So it was on somebody said Okay Siri or hey Siri open the August door lock

1204
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,047
And the person didn't have a password on their site

1205
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,607
They're on their iPad and so Siri

1206
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,631
Front door for them

1207
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,191
Are you saying that your implementations are

1208
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:18,079
Different from something like that or is there also a responsibility by someone like apple to say

1209
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Hey

1210
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,455
Maybe we shouldn't have the door unlock verbally unless there's a password hint

1211
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:28,319
Yeah I think there's a huge responsibility on the part of all the parties involved

1212
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,135
Those types of gaps are things that we

1213
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,159
Spend time

1214
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,695
With them on

1215
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,487
To try and identify again

1216
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,767
It's that balance

1217
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,535
Right

1218
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,071
Between security

1219
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,887
Inconvenience in our case we see those things as

1220
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:44,191
As important gas that need to be addressed

1221
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:50,591
I think it's also healthy to say and I'm not afraid to say it even as the futurist for a security company

1222
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,151
Nothing is 100% secure

1223
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,967
And anybody that tells you that it is

1224
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,271
Is either naive or dishonest

1225
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,599
And so I think there's a lot of things that

1226
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,879
People have done

1227
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:06,975
Especially people who are trying to Garner attention to a new brand

1228
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,535
Or startup company or something like that

1229
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,071
To try and drive it.

1230
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:17,471
Perfectly secure for all these things and all that is as bait for the hacker community

1231
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:22,591
You know I think another thing or subject that's tied very closely to your question

1232
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,615
Chicken is privacy

1233
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,639
Is well

1234
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,199
And as we go forward

1235
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:27,967
I think

1236
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:34,367
Consumers going to have a lot of questions as they're comparing you know whether it's Google home and apple or SmartThings and

1237
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,647
In Amazon

1238
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,207
Yes they're going to have to make some choices in terms of

1239
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,487
What information

1240
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
They're willing to share from a privacy

1241
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,327
Standpoint and what they are

1242
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,423
In another way that we try and address some of those things is

1243
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,727
What working hard to give options

1244
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,799
As to whether we're going to play in a mesh Network

1245
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,127
Does he know what that is you know Z-Wave type framework

1246
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:56,895
Where

1247
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,175
We're going to just

1248
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,735
Share the information directly with your hot provider

1249
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,271
Or in a cloud

1250
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,087
Cloud type of situation where we have much work

1251
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,391
Control over what is shared or not

1252
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,999
But ultimately we want to put those types of decisions in the hands of the consumer

1253
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:15,583
Okay and I know the cloud-to-cloud situation help me

1254
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:18,399
Many years back I had someone hack my wink

1255
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:23,775
And they were unable to control the Chamberlain MyQ because of the

1256
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:29,663
But they were able to unlock my Z-Wave locks these were not yours

1257
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,087
Because of the way that radio works

1258
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:40,415
If I had had one on there

1259
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:43,231
It's possible that it would have been locked at 2 cuz that's just

1260
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:47,839
The radio the truth then you don't want you

1261
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,143
Call Arkansas. Circumstance

1262
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,679
What's going to take the command

1263
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,959
From The Hub and so

1264
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:56,031
I think people are Chamberlain deserve a lot of credit

1265
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,567
For very early on

1266
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,615
Yuan their development process

1267
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,151
Figuring out ways

1268
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:01,919
Hugh

1269
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:07,295
Creatively manage some of these things without inconveniencing the consumer so kudos to them

1270
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,831
Yay

1271
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,855
All right

1272
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:14,207
No there's been talk in Europe and there's even been talk among people here

1273
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:17,279
Different organizations here about creating kind of

1274
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,327
A sticker certification

1275
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,679
Or maybe like a Good Housekeeping seal of approval for security

1276
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,239
Like a security framework for devices

1277
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,007
In the home

1278
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:30,591
And I'm curious where you guys might stand on something like that

1279
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,127
We have

1280
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:35,199
Mechanical version of that

1281
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,247
In in the form of bhma

1282
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,039
Which you know are are

1283
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:45,439
Hardware standards grade 1 lock her grades to lock or grade three lock and what those would indicate would be

1284
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,487
You know it survive

1285
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,303
This type of heat and cold to survive this type of

1286
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,839
Sledgehammer attack

1287
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,375
Kickin attempt to work

1288
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,167
You know fire safety

1289
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,495
We're very familiar with those texts

1290
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,823
Frameworks and that's not necessarily A Bad Thing

1291
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,919
What I would say is as I'll go ahead and say the expert across

1292
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,199
A couple of different

1293
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,503
Spaces in the commercial space

1294
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,807
You find the standard

1295
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,391
To be quite desperate you see a lot of proprietary Solutions

1296
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,439
That claim to be more

1297
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,207
Secure

1298
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:20,767
And then you see a body

1299
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:26,655
A group of people like Sia I'm trying to come together and provides standards not unlike

1300
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,215
You know the ones you've been talking about on your podcast

1301
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,519
You know all join you no excetera

1302
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,567
I think we're certainly open

1303
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,615
Time-in we're always looking

1304
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,639
Shoe Drive

1305
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,967
Open architecture and Open Standards because

1306
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:43,807
We believe there's a lot better technology out there when it

1307
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
Cher

1308
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:49,951
I personally and in as a company we believe the proprietary definitely does not mean more

1309
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:56,351
So let's talk about you guys currently support lots of difference

1310
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,375
Cubs

1311
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,935
Different wireless networks

1312
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,727
Y'all are clearly out there

1313
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:02,751
Doing a lot

1314
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,031
How do you view

1315
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,823
The lifetime of it Electra

1316
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:11,967
So I feel like a lock is something I installing might like an old-school lock change those unless

1317
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:16,319
You had like a break-in or something terrible has happened right this is or maybe you move

1318
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,087
These are not

1319
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:17,855
Things you

1320
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,623
Upgrade on the

1321
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
So

1322
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,231
How do you see adding connectivity to this

1323
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
Product

1324
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,791
Changing that relationship

1325
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,559
People have with it

1326
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,863
So the hardware on our product

1327
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,143
Is going to last

1328
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:32,447
20 to 30 years at minimum

1329
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:33,983
So

1330
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:37,311
You do really get into the the question of

1331
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,871
Okay so the hardware is going to last that long

1332
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:44,991
You know just from experience the technology inside is going to change

1333
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:51,903
We're trying very hard and I don't think obviously that we have this completely solved yet Stacy

1334
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,439
But we try very hard.

1335
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,231
What to do over the air updates

1336
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,023
Updates

1337
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:59,839
Create Headroom within the processors

1338
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,911
And the infrastructure within the lot

1339
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:06,751
Such that we can make it is viable as we possibly

1340
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,799
And for as long as we can

1341
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:12,383
So we're working really hard to try and figure out

1342
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,431
What is an appropriate lifetime

1343
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,735
What you also don't want to do is here

1344
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:23,135
We're trying to shrink the size of these locks right they're not the most beautiful things to look at all the time especially on the interior

1345
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:23,903
Terriers

1346
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,975
But we want to have a strong motor and we want to have

1347
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,047
Technology in there that's going to make it last

1348
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,071
So

1349
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,119
Your 2008 Z-Wave lock

1350
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,167
I believe was your first one

1351
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,471
Are those still in the market are they still working

1352
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,007
They're still working

1353
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,823
Yes I'm proud to say they are still working

1354
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
So

1355
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,615
We haven't

1356
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,687
A significant enough

1357
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,247
Drop off of some of those Technologies sale

1358
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:52,575
Stacy if we see you know some of the match match Networks

1359
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,879
You don't go away which I don't think we're going to see but

1360
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,671
If we were to see some of those

1361
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:59,231
You know Rod wife still changes

1362
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,279
Gmic chef

1363
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:05,375
We definitely do see a trend obviously especially in DIY Market

1364
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,935
Towards a cloud to Cloud infrastructure

1365
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,239
As opposed to let you know I'm a mess

1366
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,031
Network infrastructure

1367
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:17,407
But we actually see both of those products s living beside each other for quite some time

1368
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:22,271
Alright this brings us to cost because right now A connected deadbolt

1369
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,831
Even if it's not Bluetooth or something fancy

1370
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,111
Still alive

1371
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,927
Sometimes 5x the cost of a normal door lock

1372
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,207
Is this a

1373
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:33,535
Reasonable thing to expect should we see this go down

1374
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:38,143
No no I think it depends on features and functions I mean

1375
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,447
We don't know what the sweet spot is yet

1376
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,215
To be candid

1377
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,007
We're going to try and find that

1378
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:48,127
Obviously you're investing a lot in R&D and development on these things and that's not cheap

1379
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,663
But I think you'll start the

1380
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Sissy

1381
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,479
Better and better solution

1382
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,015
Coming forward with

1383
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,295
Different features

1384
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,343
The price points

1385
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,415
You know somewhere people you know who might not be filled

1386
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:04,255
Feeling comfortable about it today to get out there

1387
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,303
In in to get one

1388
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:08,607
I think the value prop

1389
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,399
That a lot of people are seeing

1390
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,447
And we have a pretty wide rain so we have a lot of

1391
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,239
Non-connected Electronics

1392
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,519
Deadbolt

1393
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,287
As well

1394
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,823
So they give you some contact

1395
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:22,175
So in the last year we sold 1.1 million electronic locks

1396
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,991
Electronic lock

1397
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,551
A tremendous number those were actually

1398
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,087
Lost it we're not connecting

1399
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,159
So they have a keypad on them

1400
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:37,791
You know some of the Innovation that you'll see from us that you might not necessarily expect from a company like Schlage

1401
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,071
Will be on

1402
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:43,935
How can we provide an enhanced capability for people with a specific need

1403
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:48,031
For example like a landlord hey I have multiple properties

1404
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,055
Can you

1405
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,591
Organized he's in

1406
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:54,687
But it makes me easier to manage remote properties

1407
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:58,527
Reset codes all those things that you would want to do

1408
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:03,647
Either a lot of other DIY devices in there as well you know you think about the

1409
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,999
All these other devices

1410
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:12,607
But you may want to set back to you know a different temperature or an original setting

1411
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,655
Once your tenants of laughs

1412
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:15,935
Oh yeah

1413
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,543
I use the keypad door lock

1414
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,591
Or that I use the actual

1415
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,615
Remote connectivity

1416
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
Aspect

1417
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,175
Let's keep going

1418
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,199
Real fast

1419
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,735
Final question for you

1420
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:31,551
Are you guys going to stick with being a devices

1421
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,599
Company or are you looking at services

1422
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,391
I think that

1423
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,183
We are manufacturer

1424
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,743
And I think that we believe

1425
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,023
There's a

1426
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,303
Really healthy

1427
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,583
Land of the two

1428
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,911
When you look at how we go to market today Stacy

1429
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,727
We're trying to figure out how can we

1430
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,495
Embed

1431
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,287
The total cost

1432
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,847
Of the device into

1433
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,127
You know that.

1434
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,663
Consumer another word

1435
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,967
If you buy our product

1436
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:04,319
We don't want to nickel-and-dime you to death with subscriptions and all kinds of other things

1437
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,879
Thor trying to find a good blend

1438
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,927
That is going to allow for us

1439
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,463
You make it really easy

1440
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,743
Really intuitive

1441
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,303
It's just a good experience all the way around

1442
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,839
Where you will see us

1443
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,143
Yo I guess you could call diving into

1444
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,423
Services someone

1445
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:24,543
We're going to try and provide the type of app functionality over time that people are asking

1446
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,103
The kind of what we talked about before

1447
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:32,223
If you have a very specific need you know you're a landlord or no some other element

1448
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,247
We will

1449
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,807
Not only ourselves but with partners

1450
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,343
Try and develop

1451
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,439
I'm good kids that are very intuitive and easy-to-use

1452
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,791
College was an RA a resident advisor

1453
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,559
Benidorm

1454
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,839
And I can tell you

1455
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,631
Biggest pain in the butt

1456
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,959
Was when people would forget their keys and I would have to

1457
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,519
Either escort them my cells are called like

1458
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,543
Somebody

1459
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,615
Call a security person to come and unlock their door for them

1460
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:03,967
I'm like wow how awesome would it be if you could just be like

1461
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:09,087
We got you covered on that

1462
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:16,511
Yes all the notes were capability to I need to start thinking about is when you talk about

1463
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,279
City managers

1464
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,327
Executive Sous job overtime

1465
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:24,703
Has been to either audit doors you know for fire safety or for any number of things

1466
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:31,103
Now we can really make some productivity gains for them we have a lot of what we call him no tour

1467
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,919
Functionality where you can go and touch that lock

1468
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,479
Without having to physically be there

1469
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:40,575
I think it's also something important in a we start talking about

1470
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,855
What's your plan

1471
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:44,671
Not for if you're going to get hacked but when

1472
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:47,487
How can we Flash the firmware

1473
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,023
Quickly easily

1474
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:52,351
Verses where if you had a master key solution

1475
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,887
You know for a large campus

1476
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,679
And if that master key got lost

1477
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,775
You're going to go change out every single cylinder in that campus

1478
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,079
Alright so the end of the master

1479
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,127
At the beginning of

1480
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,151
Omastar

1481
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:09,759
Different types of security

1482
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,551
