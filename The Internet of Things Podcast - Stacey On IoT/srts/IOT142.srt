00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,528
Explain all that in

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:27,136
We are also going to talk about iot an industrial setting and how much it can save you

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,696
Plus a little bit about Wireless Industrial

19
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,944
We each installed new devices to talk

20
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968
We've got

21
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,040

A lot of time tell you about smart fabrics and what the future holds

24
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,208
It's a little slow

25
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,768
Plus we're going to hear from Lux products

42
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784
Already

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,112
Let's talk about the death of yet another

44
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
Roddick

45
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
We got an email this week from one of our listeners

46
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,000
He writes us to tell us that

47
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
A company called

48
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
Mogio

49
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,608
Canadian company that made

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
On board diagnostics

51
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
Port products

52
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:20,288
So that's like automatic you shoved this into your car attracts things like mileage rate

53
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
Are you are you

54
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
You can tie it into

55
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Like channels like if

56
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
And track

57
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,248
I actually think it's kind of a cool thing to track your mileage to a spreadsheet if your

58
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,320
Driving a car around for business purposes

59
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
This company

60
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,184
Put out their product back in November of 2014

61
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
But

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,024
End of January the generation

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,328
1 Mojo device

64
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
It's not going to be supported anymore

65
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,704
Kevington upset because

66
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,008
This is not a very long

67
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,544
Life cycle for a product

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,408
Such as this because it's not like the pores have changed on the vehicles number one and number two

69
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
This was one of the

70
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,504
First state was the first was one of the first

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,088
Modules that had built in 3G and GPS connectivity

72
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,672
And that hasn't changed so

73
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,208
What's changed

74
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
Well it gets a little bit better

75
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,888
Apparently in the email it says they've said we carefully ensure that every customer on first generation products

76
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
Has received a minimum of

77
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
12 months of service

78
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,776
This is a device that cost $150

79
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
And

80
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
How does subscription fee

81
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,664
Your poor the cellular connectivity so this is a device that

82
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,224
You know in some place did it alright they

83
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,272
Accounted for the cost of

84
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,064
You know sending data and

85
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,416
Hardware cost that was actually fairly expensive I think the original automatic was

86
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Like 99

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
Cellular one is more

88
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
And

89
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,816
Yeah here's the thing this reminds me

90
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,120
Of like a smartphone that you might replace

91
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
The fact that this only lasted about three years

92
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,264
A car is the typically a longer-term investment it's not like you

93
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,664
Recycle through cars like smart phones in most cases the second thing is it's not like a cellular technology has changed

94
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
They had

95
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
Produced this device with a

96
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,600
Say a 2G chips that you know and those networks are shutting down as we transition

97
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,648
The Operators you know moving forward

98
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,976
LTE 5G Etc then I can sort of understand it

99
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
But

100
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
That hasn't happened so

101
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
Why I still wonder why

102
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,911
This is no longer going to work and there's no

103
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
Valid reason in my mind

104
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
Here's what they say

105
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
They say the first generation OBD2 devices

106
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
Incapable of communicating

107
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,527
And because of the way they've been manufactured we cannot

108
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
Install alternate SIM cards

109
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,511
Changed the could be and we should probably know that they have kind of changed their business model overtime as well

110
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,863
After this product came out to basic create a product and let the carriers white label it

111
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:59,263
So you could go to in fact they mentioned that you may we recommend if you know

112
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
I forget what it is but

113
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,847
So it seems like they're getting out of the Direct business

114
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
What's the direct-to-consumer

115
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,247
This is this is another example of what

116
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
We talk about when we talk

117
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,087
Talk about it looks like perhaps these guys

118
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
When they launched this in 2014

119
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
They probably didn't think ahead about life

120
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
Like what happens if we pivot

121
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
What happens if

122
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
This doesn't

123
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,631
And I think any company that's launching a connected product needs to have those contingency

124
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Hanson Place

125
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,983
And it would suck to have to use them but you should still have

126
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
And

127
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,567
Communicate that to the customer so

128
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,895
It's only words you're going to hear a lot more about this

129
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
The year ahead

130
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,735
Because it's a topic we strongly believe in

131
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,271
Very propensity

132
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,343
And I think we're going to see a lot of other companies hit the wall

133
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
It's going to become an issue

134
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
So

135
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Psy

136
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Let's move away

137
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,279
Consumer for a moment and let's talk about

138
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,839
Iot in industrial setting

139
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Cuz

140
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
I did a field trip

141
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
2

142
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
Well it was a distillation

143
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:06,079
Not whiskey distillation but like Refinery distillation and it was a little pilot plant that

144
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,871
The University of Texas has on

145
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Their campuses

146
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
And

147
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,223
I went just to kind of learned

148
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
And see

149
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
Connected sensors in action and I learned a lot

150
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
Cool stuff but the coolest thing I learned

151
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
Was

152
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,695
The challenges of Wireless in industrial environment

153
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,487
I said I did put this in my newsletter so if

154
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
If you read this forgive me

155
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
That was cool

156
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,375
So can I talk to you from Emerson was telling me that in

157
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,727
The initial setups things like trains and trucks that are

158
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Moving into load up

159
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
Refined product

160
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
They would stop the wireless

161
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
Signals to the RF environment

162
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Is super challenging there

163
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,503
One because it changes in the release large metal objects moving

164
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,551
But it's also changing

165
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
As the

166
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,391
Chemicals inside these giant metal Vats

167
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,743
Go up and down so as things are refined the volume inside changes

168
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,071
And Wireless in water They Don't Really mix so that causes

169
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
Problems

170
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,655
There were talking about like why mesh needs to be

171
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
Why mesh Wireless needed to be

172
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Be created for the

173
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
And

174
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,847
I just thought as companies are starting to roll out

175
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
More Wireless

176
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,431
Networks things like Laura

177
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
Things like sigfox

178
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
In there

179
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,319
Maybe not why does industrial but he didn't like a warehouse in Bayern

180
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,879
Some of these things are still going to be the same

181
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
You're still going to need to answer

182
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
To those problems

183
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
So

184
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,071
It is pretty cool at me we sit around our homes and complain that we can't get

185
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:36,703
Wi-Fi signal in a room you know but even when nothing is moving and changing dynamically in a warehouse I mean yeah

186
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,239
I can't wear production facility

187
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
All the movement of things I can

188
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,103
Affect wireless signals never thought of that to be honest

189
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,407
That's going to be half the investment tool

190
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
Change out from older generation

191
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,039
Wireless networks to new mesh networks or whatever solution they use but

192
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
I think they're going to have to do that

193
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:57,695
Well yeah and if you think about things like robots right those are usually metal and they're going to be moved

194
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Around so

195
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Woohoo

196
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,583
It's going to be a challenge the other challenge with mash that we should mention briefly

197
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
Is that when you

198
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
Install a mesh Network unless you're working with like a standardized thing like these Wi-Fi mesh networks there's no standardized wife

199
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
Imesh

200
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
So what we get

201
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
Is

202
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:19,199
Proprietary just going to say semi proprietary it's like there

203
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,759
Proprietary implementations of a standard

204
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
Is what it really is

205
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,623
Yeah

206
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Sync

207
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Head

208
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,487
Industrial mesh for

209
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
Wi-Fi

210
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
Bluetooth is working on

211
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Yeah it just to clarify

212
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
I'm sure people understand but for a few who may not

213
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
What you mean

214
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:45,567
Liquor my own perspective is like I can't take a Nero and attach it to my Google Wi-Fi mesh for example and vice versa

215
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Yeah

216
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,943
They all still speak Wi-Fi but to each other to create the match they're using their own

217
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
Software

218
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
Maybe that should be stand

219
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,391
Get the best out of Cheyenne Gilgamesh Network around the entire planet

220
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
All right

221
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
Also industrial news

222
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
I did I found an inch

223
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,679
Interesting article from an MIT Sloan management review

224
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,543
I thought there'd be more data in there an unfortunate wasn't but there was some very interesting information

225
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
What's a good cover

226
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,919
It has to do with facilities management and IRT so semi related to our last story

227
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
They took a look at some of the

228
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,527
Data that has been collected from large

229
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,831
Commercial buildings and Facilities over decade

230
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,487
And figured out that these places spend about a hundred billion dollars each year just a repair and Main

231
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
It's work right

232
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
The thing is

233
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,071
What they're saying is hey you know what

234
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,143
If we could use iot devices shenzhen AI

235
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
To Ghana

236
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:50,079
Figure out in advance what might need to be maintained what my break down and said we could actually reduce unnecessary Maiden

237
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,383
By about 20 to 25%

238
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,783
And that adds up I mean if it is a hundred billion dollars and you can achieve that returns 20 25%

239
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,391
$10 a year save just by using iot limitations in these facilities so

240
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
Rather interesting when you put in that respect

241
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,767
Yeah we care a lot about preventive or predictive maintenance

242
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,095
Which is about to break down quick

243
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
Fix it first

244
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,679
What we don't talk a lot about and what

245
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,727
These case studies don't cover is

246
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,311
A lot of maintenance is just routine and set based on

247
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
Every 5,000 miles you should get your

248
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
What this element is is

249
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Hey

250
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:34,111
It's been 5000 miles but you know everything still humming along so why don't you just wait a little bit longer so this is

251
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
It's preventing me

252
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
It's so it's proven

253
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
It's not predictive it

254
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Preventing

255
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Preventative

256
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,167
Yes yeah I mean instead of using just guidelines General guidelines which is kind of the way we had to do it

257
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
Before we had

258
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Big Data

259
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,567
You know saying cars like the present but yet you always do the 3000-mile oil change and tire rotation cetera but

260
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:58,687
People drive in different areas people have different weather patterns people have different road conditions

261
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:03,039
So you maybe it'll go 5-6 8000 Miles to the guidelines kind of irrelevant

262
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
When you have the data

263
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,975
Discount on individual-level weather person or a facility's plant or whatever it maybe now you can actually not spin

264
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
Minutes money when you don't need to

265
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
All right

266
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Now

267
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,119
We're going deep into the nerd hole

268
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,703
It's so worth it

269
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,263
Ivan old Shepard

270
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Kevin is

271
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
You're not old but

272
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
You previously

273
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Kids

274
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,223
20 years ago

275
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:40,671
And I've always been fascinated by this because to me are underlying silicon and Hardware

276
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
Are the parameters for what we can really do

277
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
And I know software is eating

278
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,095
The world and it's awesome but it's still constrained by the

279
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Capability for soft

280
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,447
And one of the challenges with software is power consumption

281
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
So I have been

282
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
Constantly fascinated by

283
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
The ways

284
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
Companies try to

285
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Reduce

286
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Power consumption

287
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,663
And I just read this article I linked to it

288
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,199
On a startup called

289
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
Minima it's out of Finland

290
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,039
And they're doing

291
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Okay guys

292
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,879
They're doing near threshold voltage

293
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,999
This is kind of weird but basically you got a little electric current running around on any semi

294
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
Are any transistor that

295
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Right

296
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,119
And you want to make sure

297
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,935
They usually run at a higher level so you can make sure it

298
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
Completes the circuit

299
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Candidate against

300
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
What this does is it

301
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
It takes it

302
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,079
Is low to the ground is pause

303
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
And

304
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
They basically

305
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
Will modify

306
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
The performance

307
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
So how much

308
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,527
Electricity is shoved through the chip

309
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Based on

310
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Performance team

311
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,135
So they can get away with a little bit they do

312
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439
So these chips are becoming smarter

313
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
And reducing the power

314
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Consumption

315
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
So that's what it does

316
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,119
There other companies such as ambach micro which I have covered since

317
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,703
I want to say like 2012 or 2011

318
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
I have left this come

319
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,823
And edit compute and they're also working

320
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
With low voltage

321
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,223
So I think this is a really cool concept so this is how we're going to

322
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,551
Continue pushing forward with chip design and capabilities

323
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
While also reducing

324
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,415
Our needs and being very custom to the job

325
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Things are trying

326
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:23,327
Yeah I sent her saying it just to give a frame of reference Huawei mrs. noted in the article but it jumped out at me

327
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,727
Huawei actually uses ambucs microcontrollers right now and they get 21 days on a single battery charge now

328
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,287
Granted maybe doesn't color screens

329
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
There are other aspects

330
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
Contribute to that

331
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
But

332
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,967
You compare that to a traditional say a smartwatch or other wearable in my last a day or two

333
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,295
Free sample right because it doesn't use the low threshold

334
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,623
And last week actually profiled a company called spire

335
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
And they make a

336
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
Stick on

337
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,487
Health tracker it'll go on sale in January

338
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,047
Where I said this is a activity tracker tracks

339
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
Heartbeat respiration

340
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
Sleep

341
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
It's a sticker

342
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,983
And you peel it off and you stick it in your underwear and you can wash it

343
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,031
And it just stays there and works for

344
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
Two solid

345
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
They're using

346
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
Micro can

347
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,943
That's a 2-year battery life on a device that

348
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
You actually can

349
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
I think it's crazy

350
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,599
And it's always on and always on it

351
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
Something right now

352
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
What's crazy is

353
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
Waking up in sending that data some

354
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
Now there's no screen on

355
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Which is a huge

356
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Powerhawk

357
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
Screen

358
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
Like nobody's business

359
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,423
But waking up a radio to send that data and processing that

360
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
Is just insane

361
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Hello

362
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:38,079
That's the future and so we need these types of companies because

363
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
Otherwise

364
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,919
We're going to be like charging everything in sight forever

365
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
And that's a

366
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
Now it's time for

367
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Are some rapid fire news

368
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,391
IDC has said that Global spending on iot will grow 14.6

369
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
Percent next year

370
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:58,559
And they think it's going to hit 770 2.5 billion dollars

371
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,631
They're going to assume that by

372
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
20/20

373
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Iot

374
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,751
Spending is going to be at a trillion dollars

375
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
That is insane

376
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,615
They also think that most of the money in the beginning is going to go towards

377
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Ace Hardware

378
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
Modules and sensors

379
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
How long is spending on infrastructure

380
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Security

381
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,551
Services will follow hardware and then some

382
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Which makes

383
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:26,207
Might be worth noting also that the industries that they see the spending manufacturers

384
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,999
Slated to spend the most in transfer

385
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
Rotation and utilities

386
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,095
And then you find consumer

387
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,495
Iot spending which is interesting so I focus so much on consumer that often forget it's really a smaller part of this

388
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,543
Big pie

389
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:46,431
Did you say that by 2021 more than 55% of the spending and iot projects will be

390
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,991
Before software so if you're starting your company today

391
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
Software y'all

392
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Software

393
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,391
Alright in other news a french company called atos has offered to buy gemalto

394
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
Four Points

395
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
3 billion euros

396
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:04,095
Gemalto is a company that makes SIM cards payment chips there inside things like your passport

397
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
Credit cards

398
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,679
They made the Nano Sims 4 like

399
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
IPad.

400
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,103
That was cool they make the Eastern actually for the Apple watch and possibly the pixel phones as well

401
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
Yeah so this gives atos

402
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,319
Hunk and payments and security and sim cards for the iot and since iot is so hot they are so

403
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
They want to get in on

404
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
5 billion dollar offer

405
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
That's that

406
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Oh yes

407
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:39,935
We don't get to talk about honking that much because there haven't been as many devices are supported but there is anyone

408
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,983
I didn't see Honeywell lyric

409
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
Controller

410
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:47,359
This is not like the lyric thermostat this is the actual controller panel that

411
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,663
I think you have to have this one professionally installed

412
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,223
I'm almost positive you can tell me if I'm wrong on that one

413
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:57,087
But it does have homekit support now as of December 7th

414
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,159
Yes this is their security stuff I think it even speaks with Oprah

415
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,975
Proprietary Wireless thing so this is kind of a gateway to talk to them

416
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
Proprietary Honeywell security

417
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
Except which is

418
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Indeed

419
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
All right Google Assistant

420
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
Now supports device sync

421
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
My voice

422
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
There's not much to say here

423
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,287
Well

424
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
What is device sync

425
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Some people may not

426
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:24,991
Understand what that means when you're adding devices to your smart home hub or a digital assistant usually have to go in and out

427
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
War II

428
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,063
Just a link accounts on a server

429
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,439
Now what you can do with Google Assistant once you to add something to your smart home hub a new product for example

430
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,535
You can just say to your Google Assistant hey sync my lights cuz you just had a new lights

431
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,143
It'll just do it automatically you don't have to go into the app or anything like that so

432
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,935
Little less of an obstacle to do that

433
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
It

434
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Next Step

435
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,823
You can wake up to music on your Echo just by simply saying that

436
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
Set my alarm for 6 a.m.

437
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
Beyonce

438
00:17:54,687 --> 00:18:00,831
Recurring you can choose from different music services such as Amazon music Spotify Pandora TuneIn

439
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,111
Sirius XM

440
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,671
One of my favorites cuz the Beatles Channel and iHeartRadio

441
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,119
I can just get blinds to show me the sun on the cheap I've been good shape

442
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,703
Well that brings us to my neck

443
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
Topic which is

444
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
I finally installed

445
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
The Ikea tradfri

446
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
I just like to say it

447
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
It is fun to

448
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
So

449
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,479
I had a botched initial pack

450
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
So this took me awhile and

451
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,295
And I replaced it

452
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:36,415
And now have them so the one thing I liked about the Caesar $80 from

453
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,719
Ikea the setup requires a hub

454
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,815
It has a remote control and then to light bulbs and they're white tunable

455
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,119
It does work with Madam a

456
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,167
And it also works with

457
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,239
So those are the things you need to know about

458
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,079
Now when I installed it I love the fact that I did not have

459
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Have to sign up

460
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
There was no app

461
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,455
There isn't a doubt you have to install that I didn't have to

462
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
The password I didn't have to

463
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
To do anything

464
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
Just just

465
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,415
Took a picture of his very much like the homekit setup I took a picture of the device in the back

466
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,231
Your phone's on this network this is on this network

467
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
I've now authenticated this to this

468
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,351
It's a very localized non cloud-based

469
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Solution

470
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
Yes but there is a hub so I know

471
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:26,335
It's okay I setup the remote control

472
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,407
Sitting at very close to the Gateway and saying

473
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Connect

474
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
And then

475
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
That's how you add light bulbs to stick

476
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,551
Light bulbs into the socket and then you

477
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
All the remote

478
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
Control next to them

479
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
And

480
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
It all worked

481
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
Pretty flawlessly

482
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
My challenge

483
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,023
Is now that I have enabled the echo skill

484
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,583
And have that working it recognizes

485
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
One of them

486
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
And turns it off

487
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
But it doesn't

488
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
Recognize

489
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,007
And it shows both in your Madam a app

490
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,567
Yes but one is glowing and lit up

491
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,871
The other one is not and when I go to it

492
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
I can turn it off

493
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
From Adam

494
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
It just says it doesn't recognize that

495
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
Set device name

496
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,295
Which is weird cuz it's the same device name

497
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,879
That the outlet that lamp was originally plugged into was

498
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
HEB

499
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
So I'm still troubleshooting

500
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Can be exciting

501
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
I wonder if

502
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,071
If you use a different device name as a temporary

503
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:23,167
Just to see maybe there's some confusion there with the reusing an old device name

504
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,239
So that was my initial thought but I rebooted

505
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
So I put these in our bedside tables

506
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
Lamp so I replaced

507
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
A hue light bulb called Stacy

508
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,711
With a Tri-C light bulbs now

509
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Call Stacy

510
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
I rename my hue light bulb

511
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
Anna for my daughter

512
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,623
And then I took

513
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,903
A WeMo Outlet

514
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,951
It's called Andrew that his lamp

515
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,511
Plugged into and I replaced it with a bulb

516
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
The tribe people

517
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,815
Called Andrew

518
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
And I named the new outlet

519
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
Christmas tree

520
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,655
Because my Christmas tree

521
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,983
So so much about my house

522
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
So

523
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Stacy work

524
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
The Andrew does not

525
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:08,991
Just out of curiosity does it work with the home app or do you guys not have any iOS devices

526
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,063
My husband has an iOS device but making him

527
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Play with the homie

528
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
Then he should not have a lightbulb

529
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
Next week

530
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,096
Will find out

531
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
What happened

532
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
What went wrong

533
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Help

534
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
Beat lights

535
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,032
What is the point

536
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,592
These lights are really expensive for what they are

537
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:39,200
They're kind of nice like the remote control is nice when you're like oh

538
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,016
I don't want to wake up my spouse by saying turn on Stacy or

539
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,040
Turn off Andrew

540
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:48,160
Cuz he's asleep so that is nice and the fact that they have Madam a integration

541
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,720
Makes them work exactly like they used to

542
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
When they work

543
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
Witching is not happy

544
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
We'll figure it out

545
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,888
We'll figure it out

546
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,168
It's a nice way

547
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
To do this

548
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
And so

549
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
Is it

550
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,264
Do you need this

551
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
The answers

552
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
Is it an easy

553
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
Painless kind of smart home thing

554
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,200
Is it fun to say tried fee

555
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Yes

556
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,504
There's our thoughts on

557
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
Well it's kind of funny that you have a

558
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
Troubleshooting

559
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,648
Issue with something new as did I

560
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,232
I received from I'm not going to name names but I

561
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,536
Fabulous podcast co-host I work with

562
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,632
I received a ring doorbell Pro as an early Christmas gift

563
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
Thank you Stacey

564
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
And

565
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,496
And before we hit our

566
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:40,896
12 degree windshield weather today I went out yesterday and when was a little warmer and installed being new

567
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
Ring doorbell

568
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,224
It was it was easy to install like this is

569
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,272
I think very simple for most people to do

570
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,344
I had a challenge in that my doorbell transformer

571
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
From my old doorbell

572
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
Is literally attached

573
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,720
To the very top of my circuit panel downstairs

574
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,512
There's no breaker for it

575
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,304
It just seems like it's just attached

576
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
And so I'm like

577
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
I'm not to be able to turn off the power

578
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
But it's low voltage

579
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,496
I didn't even once crossed any wires or shock mice

580
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
No problem

581
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
So

582
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,592
Ring includes two little

583
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:15,200
What should I call the little jumper so to speak or do you have to go into your current doorbell and

584
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:21,344
Attach the wires to the jumpers and a little ring box that they include very simple to do did that

585
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,184
Took off the old doorbell put in the new ring attached to wires

586
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:30,304
Perfect getting power to the app and set it up

587
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,584
So far so good

588
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,216
This literally took me about 30 minutes and I said part of that time looking for the breaker to turn off power so

589
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,008
Not a lengthy process

590
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:43,360
However when I got through the setup process with the doorbell

591
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:49,760
And it wanted to connect to my wireless network which I use a Google Wi-Fi that's actually an old onhub and one

592
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
Google Wi-Fi

593
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
Am I nice Network

594
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,880
It said it was connecting to or connected to my

595
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:00,256
Network and as soon as it got connected I could use the app I couldn't do a lot of you I couldn't do anything other than

596
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Ring the doorbell

597
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,840
This is weird why can I not connect to you

598
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:10,240
You said you were connected and in the actors that device health button and you click that you can see the power when I had more than

599
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,544
Power coming into that was not a problem

600
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,872
But just sitting at work offline and like what are you talkin about

601
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:20,224
So I spent more time than it took to actually install the thing to figure it out

602
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
And that was

603
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,832
My home network name has a special character in it

604
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:30,208
As a hyphen and I probably don't need the hyphen I had it in there from way back when I used to run multiple Networks

605
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,768
What I would name my network on the put a hyphen

606
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
Jeor -

607
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
And

608
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,120
Bryson a fool my different

609
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
Bands

610
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
Don't need to do that anymore

611
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:46,848
So what I did instead of changing my home network name which would host of about 25 different devices right now

612
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:52,992
Exactly I got creative and remembered oh I already have a guest network setup on this Google Wi-Fi

613
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
And it's just a regular

614
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,576
Network name no special characters

615
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,112
Let's see if that works

616
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
Sure nuff it does

617
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,952
It kind of bothers me

618
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
Now that I have all this work

619
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
Cloud before it gets too

620
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
It's not Nino

621
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
No

622
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,912
No it's not going to the club

623
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
When your doorbell rings

624
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
And it's going to

625
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,312
Put your phone instead of going over the Wi-Fi network

626
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,336
Because they're not on the same

627
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,640
Network but they sorta are

628
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:25,504
I checked the seven head and the IP addresses and the way Google does this it's

629
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,784
The guest Network

630
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Is

631
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,112
I want to see the same network cuz it's not but

632
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,648
It looks like it is

633
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,184
It's very interesting out there done it

634
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,024
I'll have to dig into a little bit more but I'm not seeing any issues or I can still

635
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:43,680
Access things when I go my guess what I can access my printer and so on so regardless Reddit

636
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,728
It said it soon as I got rid of my special character at work

637
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,032
And that's why I did it as a workaround

638
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
But the thing is

639
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
Rings troubleshooting for this

640
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,384
It's like okay

641
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
Connect to that Network on your phone and do a speed test

642
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:59,552
And is it more than one megabyte per second yeah it's 150 megabits per second

643
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
And I tested that multiple times

644
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,392
There should be something in the troubleshooting

645
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
Texas

646
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:10,304
Make sure you don't have special characters in your home network name because for some reason it doesn't like that

647
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
So

648
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,144
Seafood please

649
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:20,032
If I'm wrong and I just got lucky with the Yes Network and that's not the real issue with special characters let me know what

650
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
If it is I think

651
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
Yeah the app

652
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
Troubleshooting music

653
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,944
Excellent regardless of all at once it's working

654
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
It's working great

655
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,016
I set up motion zones and

656
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,672
I told Stacy before the show we have a side unit townhouse so people to walk around the actual front and come around the

657
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,208
Side front entrance

658
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488
And there's a long walk way and

659
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:44,096
And I can see them as soon as they make that corner and I'm like hey 10 steps before they even ring the doorbell

660
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,144
I get an alert right now it is awesome

661
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,192
Lovett thank-you skating Stacy

662
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
Really great

663
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,544
Ye all right now it is time for

664
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,152
As to answer a question for the iot podcast listener hotline

665
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,224

And here's our voicemail

673
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
Hi this is Denise

674
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,400
I really enjoy y'all show

675
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
And I have a

676
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:23,264
I own a commercial building a small commercial building

677
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
And

678
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:28,128
I'm always curious specially this time of the year about pipes burst

679
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,456
And I was wondering if you had any information about

680
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
Actors

681
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,784
If you do I'd love to hear about it

682
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,576
Thank you

683
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
You are in such

684
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
Luck

685
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,160
Because Miss is like

686
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Water

687
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,744
Management leak sensing

688
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Season

689
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,048
Right ahead of CES

690
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
There's a lot of products coming out on them

691
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,888
There also existing products

692
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,728
And if there's one thing Stacy likes more than lights it's

693
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,008
Leak sensors

694
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
Does weeks have been

695
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
A constant part of my

696
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
For the forever actually

697
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,944
I once had a pipe burst

698
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,736
In the apartment above me and I came home

699
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:09,600
And like there was a stream of water that could feel like a 50 gallon trash can

700
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
Like every 5 minutes just

701
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
Pouring down into my mouth

702
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
It was sex

703
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
It's very exciting

704
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
Elite sensor

705
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
Fortleaks sensors

706
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
I really love the

707
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,448
Honeywell lyric

708
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
Leak sensor

709
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:29,312
Because it can wrap around your pipes to text both leaks

710
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,128
Because it has a long tail as a 4-foot

711
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:35,456
Cord that you can actually string a couple of them together

712
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
And

713
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,064
You can wrap that around your pipes and it will detect if they're going to fry

714
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,464
Fries so as they get close to freezing it'll let you know and if it bursts or there is a leak somewhere around there

715
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:52,608
It will also let you know so I love those because they're Wi-Fi so they don't require anything special and they do temperature

716
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
And we

717
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
Detection

718
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
Undertale gives you a

719
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
A lot more surface area

720
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,264
So that's probably a great option

721
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
Now

722
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
The downside for that is

723
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,920
You got it like when you get the alert you're going to be like oh

724
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,968
Oh crap not going to drive down to my office

725
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,272
So what's really interesting

726
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,088
When are some of the things coming out so their products from a

727
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Call Finn

728
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
Spin out from Belkin

729
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,440
They're actually tracking

730
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,512
Weeks at the water valve and

731
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,816
The cool thing there is there going to be

732
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
Looking for

733
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,376
Weeks anywhere in your

734
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,680
Basically so you don't have to actually rap any

735
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:34,080
And that's going to be an algorithm that says oh my gosh you're is a lot of water and it appears to be coming from your

736
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,616
So those are cool

737
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,920
The most advanced seems to be a company called

738
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,248
Slow and what this does is it has that kind of algorithmic

739
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
Detection

740
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
Like Finn

741
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,576
But then it also

742
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,856
Can shut off the water

743
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,392
When a leak occurs

744
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,208
So if it sees a major leak in water

745
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
Going through the system

746
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,512
It's like oh no

747
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
And then

748
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
Atlas shut off the

749
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,840
Internet Sandy

750
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,912
Those are really excited there's a lot of shut-off valves happening

751
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
So you could create like a

752
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,752
Take your Honeywell and then happy

753
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
Water valve connector

754
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,568
True like a gift but

755
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,360
Honestly for something is important

756
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,640
I kind of wanted to

757
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,736
Yeah it's got the functionality to

758
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
Shut the water slow down

759
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:20,672
Either at the main or whatever the week is that's actually very very useful I did well with paying a premium for my opinion

760
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,744
A lot of these though I'm going to tell you you have to get them installed

761
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512
Professionally

762
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,072
You're going to be messing with

763
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
Which

764
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:34,240
Yeah but the for the basics the lyric is only 7999

765
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,312
Yeah and that is does the freeze detection as well which is actually

766
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,128
This time of year here in the USA that's a good thing

767
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
Exactly and there's tons of leak sensor

768
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
They're so like every

769
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
Smart home platform

770
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,832
When there's SmartThings has one root which makes a

771
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
Smoke detector

772
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:56,256
After 2 they have won the challenge with those that I don't love not all of them do freezes roosters dufur

773
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,840
But they're also just like one tiny little sensor that

774
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,144
You stick next to something and you just hope the league

775
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,472
That's the thing standpoint

776
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:09,056
That's like you got to decide in advance where the leak is going to happen

777
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
I don't like that

778
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,408
No I don't like that either my

779
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,456
Apartment situation back in college you know

780
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
I don't have access to some

781
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,016
House of Hair

782
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,576
A lot of these would be really interesting in things like

783
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
Multi-family dwelling

784
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
Because

785
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
Of like what I just described

786
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
And they don't want

787
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,560
Denise that may have been more information

788
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:33,376
Honeywell if you just want a quick leak sensor in rap

789
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
Your pipes

790
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
Or

791
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,448
You can go and Vance

792
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:41,312
And put a flow system on that tracks all the water usage in your building and then can shut

793
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
It Off

794
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,616
So if you

795
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
I have a question

796
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,664
For the iot

00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
All right

804

You do wayfinding so it's a fun interview

817
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:29,440
Hey everyone we are interrupting this week's podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is flux

818
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,232
Products and I have robbed

819
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
Here to talk about

820
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
Is Kono smart thermostat

821
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
End

822
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
Cool design feature

823
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,168
Hey Rob thanks for joining us

824
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,216
Can you start by quickly telling us

825
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
What it is

826
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
We are a

827
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,848
Trout philadelphia-based innovator of HVAC

828
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
Controls

829
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,176
And as you mentioned our newest product in the market is

830
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,760
Is the Lux Kono smart thermostat which has all the features

831
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
You can imagine

832
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:59,904
And some more I hope we get to talk about a hundred and forty-nine bucks at your local Home Depot store or of course he

833
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,928
You can shop online

834
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
Excellent

835
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,000
So the first thing I noticed was that

836
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:07,584
There were a bunch of different options for me to change out the faceplate

837
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
On this thing

838
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,144
Can you tell me a little bit more about

839
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:14,496
We believe in personalization out-of-the-box are

840
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,800
Decor snap cover what we call them

841
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
Is in a great black

842
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
Stainless steel

843
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
Color which is very popular right

844
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,992
But as you know people decorate differently their walls look different

845
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,320
They might want to match something or contrast with something

846
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
You think so we have

847
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
A bunch of other apps

848
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,928
Since we have a hibiscus Red Sea

849
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,464
Deep Blue

850
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,512
Of course we have a black and a white

851
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,280
And as you mention

852
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
You paint it

853
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,584
So when you're

854
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,864
Spending all that money

855
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,912
Dressing up your living room and

856
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
Changing the colors

857
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,216
You can now

858
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:50,592
Customize your own thermostat with large of course not covered where you can have your kids draw something nice

859
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,616
What other designer

860
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
Taken to consider

861
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
Duration

862
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,736
If you look at the product you can't help but notice it has

863
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,760
It's great big

864
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,552
Brushed aluminum knob on it

865
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,880
And that's the control knob that's how you get into the user interface

866
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,928
How you make the thermostat warmer

867
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
And cooler

868
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
Very easy to use

869
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,792
It's part of the reason why we came up with the

870
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,072
Ancona because when you

871
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,608
You see it you're going to want to touch it

872
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,168
So I love that you're focused on design in person

873
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,960
Ization what other features have

874
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
You built into

875
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
It has

876
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,776
A lot of smart

877
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,080
Teacher so works with all the three major voices

878
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,360
Assistance Apple

879
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
Amazon

880
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
And Google

881
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,200
It also has geofence

882
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,760
Sing we call that home-and-away aware and

883
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:36,160
We also have something for IAQ indoor air quality so there's a lot of different built-in features that work through

884
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,440
Through the app and through the storm

885
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,000
Thermostat to make it an excellent entry point

886
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,280
For any Smart Home

887
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,328
Can you tell me a little bit more about IQ

888
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,400
We have a long history of understanding the need to

889
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
Remove air

890
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,192
Sew weave

891
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,520
Come up with a product we also call are smart IQ

892
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,568
We connect with a third party

893
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
Air sensor

894
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,408
And when it detects a pollution event

895
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,224
It'll through the cloud to Cloud integration

896
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,784
Tell our thermostat to turn the air on

897
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,064
And automatically you have

898
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,440
IAQ event we will circulate the air through your filter and through your air quality system

899
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
Something awesome

900
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,256
Where can we go to find out

901
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:18,144
You can stop by your local Home Depot store or you can go online Deluxe products.com

902
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:23,520
Of course you can shop online and learn more about the Kono smart thermostat

903
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:35,296

And I am super excited we have had this conversation I feel like over a year ago

913
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,520
You got to come on the show and talk about this

914
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
It just did

915
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
Open until

Better late than never

917
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,688

918
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
We just come that much further

919
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,296
We're talking about smart Fabrics today

920
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:11,136
So explain to me what these are what this entails

921
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
Where We Are Tour

922
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,952
The definition of smart

923
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
Probably depends a little bit on

924
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
Who you're talkin

925
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,816
But I like to think of it as

926
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,120
Sensors embedded into

927
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Fabrics

928
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,912
There's also a place

929
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
We're just delivering

930
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,704
Power

931
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
Ortygia

932
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,056
Through Fabrics but I really like to think of it is textile based

933
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,104
Sensors used for biometrics

934
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
Mostly

935
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,176
Okay where are we today with

936
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
Like the development of this

937
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,808
Yeah we have more technological capability

938
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,832
And we have

939
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
Business case

940
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,416
That is there's all kinds of fantastic things we can

941
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,720
Do with textile base sensors in

942
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744
And smart textiles

943
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:52,864
Or clothing but there isn't a fantastic way to make money at it yet so what you can see if you look across

944
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,728
Kickstarter or Indiegogo or go do some of the hardware accelerators

945
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,568
Different ideas on what could be done

946
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,104
With sensing in

947
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
Soft goods

948
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,432
But you find very little of them really making

949
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,200
Can a big impact

950
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
Market

951
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,808
I think some of us are probably familiar with what we've seen in

952
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
Sportswear

953
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
That is workout

954
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,416
Clothing that's really quantify your activity

955
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:21,280
Hope you understand how many calories you burn to help you understand is your posture correct

956
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,560
Your emotions correct

957
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,840
And give you that kind of feedback

958
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:29,984
What we haven't seen yet is something for the commercial Market that really solves a very big problem

959
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,032
And I think we are approaching a

960
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,848
We're going to begin to see some things happening in the medical in

961
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,688
Where you'll begin to see patients sent home with

962
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
An item

963
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,552
Smart clothing that they can wear that'll take their basic measure

964
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,600
Heart rate respiration

965
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Temperature

966
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,416
The three most critical and they can take them

967
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
Constantly

968
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,976
So you don't even have to be involved in

969
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,024
Anyway and just simply send that data back

970
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,816
To your medical practice

971
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,400
Keep tabs on you in real time this also has

972
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,936
Utility for

973
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
Pharmaceutical trial

974
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,056
Where they often rely on people to do self-reporting

975
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,080
How they feel

976
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,896
When trying a new truck if your getting some of these basic

977
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,456
Have to rely as much on self according to

978
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,736
Beware

979
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,016
Some sort of change

980
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,064
Gym shorts

981
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,600
There's a lot of things we can do

982
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,136
But very few ways to make money

983
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:20,928
Okay

984
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,464
It will talk about some of the

985
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,256
Cool health and safety stuff

986
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,048
A little bit more in depth later

987
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,840
Let's dig into

988
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
The tech

989
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:32,192
So I feel like conductive Fabrics

990
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,752
Are all the rage and thinking about things like

991
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,336
Hey there Google Levi's Jacquard jacket thing

992
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,384
Honestly is a little bit disappointing

993
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
Partly because of the business case

994
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,808
What the heck is a little

995
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
Disappointing

996
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
What is the tech

997
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,904
Inside these things

998
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
What is it really in

999
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,512
Well usually involves a conductive alipay

1000
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,584
Historically that's been things

1001
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,632
Conductive Yarns that are either

1002
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,656
Cotyledons

1003
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
Silver ore

1004
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,752
Somehow plated with conductive material

1005
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
Can you can imagine that

1006
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,848
Any sort of fabric you put three that's one of our process

1007
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,872
This is not going to be

1008
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
Extremely durable

1009
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:19,040
They do we honor the fabric shrink as you wash them or change shape as you watch them and that's not good for these

1010
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:19,808
In Alaska

1011
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,088
Conductors

1012
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,136
So that's a limiting factor right there

1013
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,928
A lot of work has been done by

1014
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,464
Companies like coupons

1015
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,744
In creating

1016
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
Conductive ink

1017
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,328
It can be very easily silkscreen

1018
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,608
Who owns Annie's

1019
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,912
Textile Laura

1020
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,936
Piece of class

1021
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,728
And be able to wish

1022
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
Damned

1023
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,800
The flexing in the strain

1024
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
The Distortion that goes along

1025
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
Being embedded in

1026
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,920
Flexible substrate

1027
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
And that seems to be the next generation

1028
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,576
They can be used both for data transmission they can be used for

1029
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
Fencing

1030
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,160
It can be used even to a certain extent for low-power tree

1031
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,952
It's got a lot of property

1032
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,024
To improve what we can do and there's a drive cost

1033
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,792
Wait

1034
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,632
As well okay so when I think smart Fabrics I should think things with

1035
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
Conductive thread

1036
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
Now what about

1037
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
I have like

1038
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:08,960
Smart socks

1039
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
Github conductive

1040
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,264
And then there's like a little

1041
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,544
Power Radio

1042
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
Computer pack

1043
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
You stick on

1044
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
Is that the goal is to have

1045
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:21,760
This soft Fabrics that conduct electricity and then some sort of hard non washable computer pack

1046
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,784
Clicks into it

1047
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,832
That's certainly not the goal

1048
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,368
But that is the state of the

1049
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
Technology

1050
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
Today the elect

1051
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:28,928
Chronixx

1052
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
Generally

1053
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,976
They are not embedded

1054
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,768
In the fabric itself

1055
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,072
I think there's work being done on

1056
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
Making

1057
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,656
Semiconductors on kapton substrates

1058
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,704
You can truly imagine

1059
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,496
Flexible

1060
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,032
I see that could be

1061
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,056
Embedded in the Fab

1062
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,384
But I think we're several years away

1063
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,664
Actual production

1064
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,736
Such a thing for the time being it is going to be

1065
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
Spencer's

1066
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,528
Or

1067
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,808
Los conductores

1068
00:40:56,064 --> 00:41:00,672
Inside a text Tyler their substrate that have to make a physical connection

1069
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,464
To some sort of

1070
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,048
Small PCB with a microcontroller chip on it

1071
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,584
That can actually process with

1072
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
Incense

1073
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,400
Okay and you said caps Trump

1074
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,424
Substrate

1075
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
I missed

1076
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
Captain

1077
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:20,128
Well if you've ever seen a flexible printed circuit the substrate material there is typically something called cops on

1078
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:25,248
It's basically just a type of thin flexible plastic that offend you can scroll traces

1079
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,808
Alright okay

1080
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,344
So if I'm thinking about

1081
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Clothing

1082
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
I feel like

1083
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,416
We talked about the

1084
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,952
Athletic Market we talked about

1085
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,232
Health and Wellness

1086
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:40,352
I feel like there's also opportunities in like firefighters and military operations made

1087
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Yes and that

1088
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,472
Seems to be where the sustainable businesses are focused

1089
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
Today

1090
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,776
Show me some much smaller

1091
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:51,872
Any more chat warehouse and safety or the end

1092
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,919
Goal you can actually command a reasonable

1093
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,455
Price to build a small business

1094
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,991
Is a few companies

1095
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:01,343
Working in this area for a long time and they deliver things to the military

1096
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,647
Vertically called smarts told your sister

1097
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:07,231
And this can be anything from a way to

1098
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,303
Distribute power around a soldier's vest

1099
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
So you can imagine.

1100
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
Many different devices

1101
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,911
Clipped or pocketed in their vest

1102
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,215
You need to keep them powered or charged

1103
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
The way of the

1104
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,287
Distributing that power throughout the best

1105
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,079
Or way of Distributing

1106
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
Throughout

1107
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,431
So that a remote operation unit could

1108
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,223
Our particular

1109
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,247
Squatter team

1110
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:33,599
Is behaving really going to take it to heart rates and respiration in that sort of thing

1111
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,391
To be able to monitor the condition

1112
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,183
Each individual

1113
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,487
It's also got a lot of application

1114
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
In Aerospace

1115
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:46,143
And there's a one of the Pioneers in this area is a Canadian company called acts of skin that's long been involved

1116
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,423
In Aerospace

1117
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
And

1118
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,775
By being able to deploy sensors into

1119
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,079
The suits that astronauts wear

1120
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,383
That's been one of the key areas that

1121
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,431
Smart Fabrics have been involved in 4 years

1122
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,271
But I think the technology is progressing to a point where now it can be much less than

1123
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,295
Intrusive

1124
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,087
And you can probably

1125
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,671
Understand what's going on with the astronauts in much greater precision

1126
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Any previously

1127
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,999
Okay now what about taking this outside of

1128
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
Of clothing

1129
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,303
So clothing is awesome

1130
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
I get the

1131
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
Utility there

1132
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:20,191
But there's also a lot of opportunity it feels like maybe embedding it in

1133
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,751
Furniture or even like my sheets

1134
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:27,359
Track my actual sleep patterns in a way that maybe is less intrusive than a Fitbit

1135
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,895
What are they doing outside of

1136
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
And smart

1137
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,711
Yeah that's

1138
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,759
That really interesting question

1139
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
When you think about it is

1140
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,087
It's one of the new

1141
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,111
Implications

1142
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:44,511
The consumer iot and wearables in general is that now we get to collect a lot more information about ourselves

1143
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:48,095
The question if you're going to be sensing all this data about her

1144
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,631
Cells in all these varieties

1145
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,447
Products what's the best place to really deploy

1146
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,495
Particular sensor for a given

1147
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,519
In a use case

1148
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:59,871
I do think betting is a place where we're going to see sensing appear

1149
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,895
Just by default

1150
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:04,479
And it will be sort of a common trait

1151
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,783
In mattresses or in

1152
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,807
Full bed assembly

1153
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,343
That they will be able to

1154
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
To report to you

1155
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,695
Your sleep activity there's a product that t e was involved with

1156
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,231
That is now used

1157
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
It's called sleep tracker

1158
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
By Serta

1159
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,911
And basically what that's doing is sensing the heart rate and respiration and lotion

1160
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
Of anybody who's on the bed

1161
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
I believe it

1162
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:29,055
Spice enough that it can even identify

1163
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
Individual

1164
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,103
Based on their heart rate

1165
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,895
Because we all have unique patterns in her heart

1166
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,431
That

1167
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
Sensitive

1168
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,991
And it's totally untrue

1169
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,271
You'd never know it was

1170
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,831
Floyd in the bed unless you went looking for it

1171
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,391
Specifically that's one place but we all

1172
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,415
Sidon automobile

1173
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,463
There's bin sensors in

1174
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
Car seats for a long time

1175
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,815
But now with the Advent of smart textiles

1176
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,119
You can actually deploy soft

1177
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:58,239
Sensors in the steering wheel and with two hands on the steering wheel you be able to measure heart

1178
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:04,639
With sensors in the seat you'll be able to measure heart rate as well as respiration you can tell if an individual's awake

1179
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
Upset

1180
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,199
You can tell alot about

1181
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,247
What's going on under those circumstances

1182
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,575
Even in an industrial setting in the

1183
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,135
If you even conducted Fab

1184
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,695
You can do things like gate to text

1185
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,999
So that you won't need to carry around.

1186
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
Key card

1187
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:24,863
The building will be able to identify you simply by the way you walk

1188
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,887
You can also do things

1189
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,191
Give people directions throughout a venue

1190
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,727
Their next meeting

1191
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,775
Imagine embedded LEDs

1192
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,567
That recognize your dates

1193
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,103
And then like the pastor

1194
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,407
Wherever you need to go to your next meeting

1195
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,687
You have a lot of impact

1196
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,735
Weed control in large areas

1197
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:45,087
Oh my gosh Nick I went from

1198
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,367
Oh my God terrifying

1199
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,927
That could be really helpful

1200
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,207
So

1201
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,303
HIIT isn't it

1202
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:59,935
So let's talk about a factor let's get into the Privacy factor and

1203
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,239
All of these sensors seem to be

1204
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:08,639
Deploy to figuring out what's happening in a person's body or health reasons and I know that's lovely but you know

1205
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:13,247
You know I don't want my bed necessarily recognizing that I'm on it with someone who isn't my partner for exam

1206
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,551
Because

1207
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,575
That's scary

1208
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:22,719
So if I think about that how do we do this without dealing with like identifying people are there other useful things that could

1209
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,791
Maybe it's like light sensing

1210
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
Sensors in your car

1211
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,839
Curtains

1212
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
Automatically

1213
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,375
Open

1214
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,935
Or things that are less like

1215
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,215
Scary to me person

1216
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,007
There are things that can

1217
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:35,775
Be done with

1218
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,335
Fabrics themselves this is another genre

1219
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,639
Smart Fabrics words not about biometrics

1220
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,175
About environmental science

1221
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,223
So you can imagine shirts

1222
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,527
Or clothing

1223
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,087
Brick that has interaction with the outdoor

1224
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,879
And in big cities

1225
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415
Places that I traveled

1226
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,463
Do you like Shanghai

1227
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,487
The air quality

1228
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,279
What is she wearing a jacket

1229
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,559
Something that

1230
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,351
Would have a small section of it

1231
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
That would change color

1232
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,703
To give you some indication of air quality and let you know when you should be

1233
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
Concern there's things like that

1234
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,775
It could be done there's also

1235
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,311
The opportunity now we

1236
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,871
Research being done universities to

1237
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:15,199
Actually use Fabrics that can generate a little bit of a charge

1238
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,991
Kinetic energy

1239
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,271
I guess we move in s

1240
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,831
We walk either things that don't have any applications

1241
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,599
Privacy

1242
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,391
But they do provide a certain utility

1243
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:29,535
I think another interesting option is things like haptic feedback for wayfinding for example

1244
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:35,423
I've always because I can't tell my left from my right I've always wanted to have

1245
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215
Sleeves or

1246
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,751
Maybe in my shoulders

1247
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,055
It's like hey turn left here

1248
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
I seen

1249
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,127
More than one startup come up with

1250
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,407
Products shoes

1251
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:50,783
That will give you a half on the left shoe or the right shoe depending on where you're supposed to turn

1252
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
That can be used

1253
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:56,671
People who are visually impaired

1254
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,695
Where we're trying to go

1255
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,279
Let's talk about business models not just business models for the

1256
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,583
How many starting this but how this stuff gets done

1257
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:09,983
I think what we'll see is that people will come up with certain technologies that will get lice

1258
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,335
Intersection between technology and fashion

1259
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,407
Which for me as a guy who is not fast

1260
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:18,943
Lesbian

1261
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
Fascinating Journey

1262
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,759
To see that

1263
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,831
Not only can this technology be useful

1264
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:28,159
Can provide really valuable insight into our health

1265
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,439
Adorn fireman

1266
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,255
But there's an aspect of the technology that can be used

1267
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:36,095
To be beautiful and I think it's in cases like

1268
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:36,863
Is that

1269
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,631
Where

1270
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,679
The fashion industry will

1271
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,519
And it would then become much more acceptable

1272
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,799
Unless avant-garde

1273
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,615
There's been some people who have experimented with

1274
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,151
Kind of social

1275
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,175
Smart Fabric

1276
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,991
You can imagine going to a football game

1277
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,271
Where are you wearing your

1278
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,063
Favorite players Jersey

1279
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,855
And it has haptics built into it

1280
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,671
Every time your player takes a hit you feel something

1281
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,719
In that part of the Jersey

1282
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,791
Or if your team scores a goal that shirt lights up

1283
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,583
You can imagine the rest of the fan

1284
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,631
In the stadium having their shirts on ladybug

1285
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
The same time

1286
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,447
To get these kind of shared experiences

1287
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,983
That's another issue

1288
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,055
A real useful case

1289
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
But it's

1290
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,407
And I think it's that combination between

1291
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,943
Technology and fashion

1292
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,223
They can really

1293
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,503
Help push this

1294
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,271
Forwarding

1295
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,063
Real viable commercial

1296
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
Enterprises

1297
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:33,951
Yes I think the fun stuff especially like the football jersey is a great example

1298
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,743
Because people already spend too much money

1299
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,119
I could totally see how something like that

1300
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,191
So where are we with the economic

1301
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,727
So in terms of

1302
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,031
How much these Fabrics cost per

1303
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,311
Are yard I don't even know

1304
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
Certainly

1305
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,175
In electronics in technology

1306
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,455
We're in

1307
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,991
Slow mix

1308
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,015
High volume

1309
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
What is produced

1310
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,343
The same thing in extremely high volume

1311
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,367
Lowest possible

1312
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,415
In fashion it's

1313
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
Much different

1314
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,463
You're providing

1315
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,535
Clothing that changes every season and even if you have us

1316
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,351
Successful line of clothing

1317
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:16,447
Sizes so it's really much more of a high mix low volume

1318
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,727
The two

1319
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,007
Diametrically opposed

1320
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,543
The good news is

1321
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:24,127
As Mobile Electronics proliferate whether it's wearables or

1322
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:24,895
Smartphone

1323
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,943
The cost of all those Electronics

1324
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,783
The incremental cost to look at a new industry like

1325
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
Smart clothing

1326
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,111
Is slowly decreasing

1327
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,647
The challenges

1328
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,463
With the integration of the sensors

1329
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,487
And the electronic

1330
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:44,095
There's a few players out there both jabil and Flextronics

1331
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
No flex

1332
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,911
Double stem sinking

1333
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,495
Significant amount of effort into being able to deploy

1334
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,543
Smart clothing and solve these problems

1335
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
Brands

1336
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,847
Any bothan some.

1337
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:55,871
Projects

1338
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,175
It's still very early days

1339
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,711
You Netflix has some partner

1340
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,247
Better traditional

1341
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,527
Textile manufacturer

1342
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,367
Investing in this area have we as well

1343
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,415
But it's still very early

1344
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,439
And without

1345
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
Big money tree

1346
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,231
Really

1347
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,023
Focused effort

1348
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,071
It's going to be a lot of hit and miss

1349
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
Projects

1350
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
That's it

1351
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,911
1 as we see continued

1352
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,471
Investment and things like firefighter safety

1353
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:26,079
Body cameras on police officers or decreasing the technology of the military and

1354
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,639
Space exploration that investment is going to

1355
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,663
Continue and Nick

1356
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,687
TTC

1357
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:37,087
Does technology going to continue being developed in North Carolina and NC State and Raleigh has a fantastic

1358
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,623
Body-worn sensor

1359
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,927
Particularly Amy a textile in a

1360
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,231
Even so you're still basic

1361
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,255
Problems

1362
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,023
The connector

1363
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,095
The coast between a textile and electronics

1364
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,631
That's funny

1365
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,935
That has yet to be solved

1366
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,751
A TE Connectivity we've looked at that end

1367
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,519
Simplism

1368
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:59,103
It's actually a very significant challenge to go from something

1369
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,151
Soft and pliable to something

1370
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,175
Hard and firm

1371
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,223
Let's talk about

1372
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,503
What other big problem

1373
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,551
For that switches sustainability

1374
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,831
When I think about

1375
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,647
Smart Fabrics I get really really excited but then I'm also like

1376
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,487
That's going to be horrified because right now you know

1377
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,023
Clothing does get recycled

1378
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,863
And I feel better about tossing away a cotton shirt that I might

1379
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,911
Something that's covered in Silver Sol

1380
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:27,007
How do you guys think about designing for sustainability or do people think about that at all

1381
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,567
I think at this early stage very few people

1382
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:32,383
Thinking about it they're thinking about survivable

1383
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,223
But the sustainability is an issue because

1384
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:36,991
In

1385
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,527
Fashion industry overall

1386
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:42,879
Sustainability is really an important question that a lot of companies are struggling

1387
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,671
So I think if we do look forward

1388
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,695
The electronics

1389
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
People like cheese

1390
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:51,327
Could you play into an extent the raw materials area this

1391
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,631
We've looked at conductive inks for a long time

1392
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,655
Finding

1393
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,423
Formula for

1394
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,495
Conductive ink that is biodegradable that would have a lot

1395
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,543
As long as you can still meet the bass

1396
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,335
Requirements of being deployed

1397
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:05,407
Textile so I think there are going to be advances like that that will

1398
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,943
Current parallel but

1399
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,967
Very little of it

1400
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,271
Before

1401
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,551
We start seeing

1402
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,831
Really good

1403
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,623
Valuable businesses emerging in

1404
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,391
Syria

1405
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:21,535
All right but Nick Picks so much for talking to me about this as a fashion lover and a tech lover I am excited

1406
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Terrified

1407
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,095
And back to excited

1408
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,399
My pleasure state

1409
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
Happiest people

1410
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,519
That's it for this week thanks so much for listening

1411
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:37,919
And remember if you'd like more iot news sign up for my newsletter at Stacey on iot

1412
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,199
Will see you next week
