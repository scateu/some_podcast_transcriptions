Happy New Year first of all to you and all of our listeners

72
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
I can't believe it

73
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
2019 already

74
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
I can

75
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
2018 was just

76
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
Bear of the year

77
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,200
This is true

78
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
For many many reasons

79
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,528
Somaya tea related in some not but yes

80
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
I'm very glad to put that calendar

81
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,648
So here we are flipping the calendar first thing

82
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Probably going to talk

83
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
Talk about

84
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
Because next week we're heading there

85
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,024
Actually later this week we're heading

86
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,656
We're going to Vegas for CES that's the Consumer Electronics Show it's a big show for

87
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,472
Consumer electronics

88
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,824
I thought we were just going to Vegas we have to go to this show

89
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
Hey

90
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
It's like a hundred

91
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,456
Twenty thousand hundred fifty thousand people Vegas is that showed

92
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,296
Yes yes it is this is what your third Sia

93
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
It's actually going to be my V

94
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,904
Your 50s look at you should get a special star

95
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,208
Oh and it's like your 20th

96
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
No I think it's

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
12 * 30

98
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:17,632
Teens I can't recall but I'm looking forward to walking the many miles around

99
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
Vegas the convention

100
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:25,056
All the hotels and of course I will be tracking all those steps like I always do to see if I can

101
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,384
Break my CS record which I think is like 52 miles at week

102
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
That is insane

103
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
You go right ahead and so

104
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
We will have

105
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
Next week's episode is going to be

106
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
On the 10th

107
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,136
Recorded at CES will be talking about cool things that we

108
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,720
Racine and then we're also doing a special CES episodes

109
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
It will come out the fort

110
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
And on that

111
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Episode

112
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
You will hear

113
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:51,168
From people we met at CES talking again about consumer trends

114
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
But

115
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
We're going to do it

116
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,640
We kind of have to logistically is her tricky because CES is still going on as we're going to be recording the show

117
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,968
From CVS Oster maybe new things we find out

118
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,016
After the show for example again

119
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,832
Interviewing and talking to people we've got to edit and so on and so forth

120
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
I think that's a good approach

121
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
Two weeks of CBS coverage

122
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
Yay

123
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
So just

124
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
Real quickly

125
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,024
We'll go down some we won't go too much

126
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
Listen to it but I think it's worth

127
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
Giving you a heads up on things that I say

128
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
Super nuts

129
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
So 1

130
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
Connected bathroom

131
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
You guys

132
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
I

133
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,799
Expect I told you this and I was like I regret to

134
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
We are going to see smart toilets at CES

135
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
We are we are going to see them from

136
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
Many of the major brands and

137
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
They're going to have

138
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Some crazy feet

139
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,599
And I can't give you too many details about all of these

140
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Plus I'm sure I'm going to see

141
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
Evenboer

142
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
But

143
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,767
You should expect some smart speaker toilets maybe some flights may be soon

144
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
Interesting

145
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583
Cleaning technology

146
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
It's going to be wild

147
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,167
I'm going to let you hit those boots

148
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,543
Cuz that's not my jam that's all I'm going to say

149
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
We're going to shoot

150
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Video

151
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,871
It's going to be fine

152
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,455
So that's it in in addition to toilets

153
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
You're going to see a lot happening in the bath

154
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
So smart mirrors going to be a thing

155
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,135
Lot of smart Health technology that

156
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
It's going to try to

157
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,719
Incorporate things from your scale and

158
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Mirror's Edge

159
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,071
Other new devices that are going to be out

160
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
I hope all is

161
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,423
Bathroom essentials in the smart home are

162
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,263
Battery power because I don't feel like rewiring electricity in my bathroom

163
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,799
Or something like a smart

164
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
Mirror for example

165
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
That is a point

166
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663
So and we saw this actually

167
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:42,783
It was a two years ago that Moen launch there they had a smart shower

168
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
Thing in the last year

169
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
Kohler launched

170
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
Couple smart bathroom thing

171
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
As well

172
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:53,023
The challenge with a lot of these is people do not have electricity like you have to

173
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
To put

174
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,607
To put the Moen smart shower thing and you had to

175
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,423
Install basically a touch screen in Your Shower

176
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,983
And you had to wire electricity to your shower

177
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
And that's

178
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,335
Yeah do that with the water off is my recommendation

179
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
I would have sent you

180
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,407
Hire a professional for this

181
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
Particular

182
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Insomnia

183
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
So that'll be kind of

184
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,807
I said not to do it

185
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,927
Another thing I think we're going to see are some really crazy cool headphone

186
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
I think we're going to see a lot of

187
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
We talked in the past about getting

188
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,047
Google Assistant

189
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,863
Madame de all of these in anime

190
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Amazon

191
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,727
Getting that into headphones I think we're even going to see some

192
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Cool sensors

193
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543
If not at CES

194
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
I think we're going to see it

195
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
This coming year in

196
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
2019

197
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
You know what there's a bunch of

198
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
Smart headphones incurables

199
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Out now

200
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,111
And it's early in this market for sure and companies have integrated assistance

201
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
Listen to headphones

202
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,975
Cordless headphones need to be connected by Bluetooth to some

203
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
Smarter device

204
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
To get the information from the

205
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,863
Cloud I wonder you think maybe there's a wave

206
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
For these

207
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Headphone makers

208
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:08,031
To make headphones almost always connected but not with Bluetooth met with Wi-Fi but

209
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,335
Get the Wi-Fi off when you're not using the assistant parts

210
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
Just cuz of Wifi battery drain I mean

211
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
I'll try to think of what could Advance this

212
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
I'm thinking more of the Thai

213
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,551
So I think it'll offer Health and Wellness

214
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:25,439
I'm thinking we'll probably see you know you can actually get a lot of really interesting information for me

215
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Ear

216
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,255
So I think we're going to see something

217
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
Like that

218
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
As opposed to an always

219
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
On

220
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,935
Individual I think you're right when you frame it that way but I'm going to

221
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,239
Say that I don't think they'll be a big thing

222
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,591
And the reason I think that is because headphones aren't something you wear all the time

223
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,639
Like my Apple watch for example

224
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,431
Take an Android Wear watch doesn't matter

225
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
That's

226
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,527
True now I could see it for more accurately

227
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Like a heart rate monitor

228
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
In your Apple watch actually

229
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
For people who don't have

230
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,975
This may be in a baby more power efficient or better place

231
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
To put it I don't know

232
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,559
There's definitely in it and accuracy benefit in certain

233
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,119
Thanks no doubt about it I just I don't know

234
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
Maybe four people don't wear watch

235
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
Watches or other wearable

236
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Keith Whitley

237
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
Interesting

238
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,799
Yeah so and they are way more accurate

239
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,079
Speaking of

240
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Icing

241
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
In 29

242
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
18

243
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
And you know also at CVS

244
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
We're going to see

245
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
Sea change

246
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
In the number of

247
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Appel

248
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
And wellness-related devices

249
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Algorithm

250
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,439
And we're going to start seeing FDA approval

251
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
On a lot of

252
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
Thor on some of them

253
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
And that's going to be really

254
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,095
Cuz we see right now you know some of its

255
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Snake oil right you're like

256
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
You can track this it'll be amazing but

257
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,751
You don't really know if it's actually doing anything or

258
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,311
You know what this heart rate monitor is actually

259
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
We accurate enough

260
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
But

261
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:51,199
With Amazon they've got actually Omron is a blood pressure cuff

262
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
Apus monitor there actually making

263
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,783
A wristband that's going to

264
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
Check your blood pressure constant

265
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
So if you look at something like that

266
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
You can now ask

267
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
You know Madam a what

268
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
My blood pressure

269
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
That becomes really

270
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,047
Kind of exciting and then I also see

271
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
A lot of research

272
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,119
Husband going into things

273
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,727
Looks like gate detection for various illnesses and then things like

274
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Using your voice

275
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Understand if you're

276
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
Depressed

277
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,871
If you have Parkinson's if you have some other medical condition

278
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,735
And I think we're going to start to see that in FDA-approved Fashions on our

279
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
Smartphones and device

280
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
And that's going to be

281
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
Freaking awesome

282
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Splashtown

283
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,927
I think you're right and I also would add to it

284
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
I hope they say I'm not going to text back

285
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,791
PC but I hope to see more

286
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
Simple ways to

287
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,863
Share this data with

288
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Your health provider

289
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,935
I think that's going to take a little bit low

290
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
But that's okay

291
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,775
And I think I could stew actually the next thing

292
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
That I have on my list

293
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
Privacy

294
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,199
I think we're going to have to come up with ways to understand how the state is being used and

295
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
We're going to have to

296
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
To figure out

297
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
How to protect

298
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Consumers

299
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
And how far we want to go

300
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,391
With like health insurance and pre-existing conditions

301
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
Because

302
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
This is going to

303
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
Exposed

304
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
A whole new area

305
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Risk

306
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
And that's scary for health

307
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
And I don't know how we're going to handle

308
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,983
That I mean if you can tell if someone's having Parkinson's symptoms

309
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
Super early this is not something that

310
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Security camera

311
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Managed right

312
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,383
What does that mean

313
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
If you can detect it

314
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Early

315
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,759
How does it affect rates coverage

316
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,063
Can you get coverage absolutely

317
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,111
I think this is more of a long-term

318
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Problem

319
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
We're going to see those things

320
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
Start to happen

321
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,791
When we vote me out because we've started to see this already

322
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
In terms of with driving Percocet

323
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
Safe driver

324
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Monitoring

325
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
Devices that you put in a car first

326
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495
You can get ready to sit down or up

327
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
Based on how are you

328
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
Try for 60 days or 30 days

329
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
But you're right

330
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,871
The reason I say it's a longer-term

331
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Being is because

332
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
You get into it

333
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
Policy now and governments and

334
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,295
The healthcare industry is so slow.

335
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,111
To change as are the laws that regulated

336
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,927
Where it is regulated so but you're right this is

337
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
Where we start to see

338
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,255
How that's going to shake out in the coming years

339
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,815
Yasso in John Hancock for example

340
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
Bill has a

341
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,399
Insurance policy that requires you to have

342
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
Connect

343
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Wearable device

344
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
Yes it is so

345
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Not to

346
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Crazy

347
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Also the privacy

348
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,615
We're going to see some sort of Regulation I guarantee it

349
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
It's going to be

350
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Probably pretty crappy

351
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,455
Lot of negotiations back

352
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,503
Back and forth but I

353
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
In 2019 we're going to get our version of

354
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
PR

355
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Close enough

356
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
I passed like a

357
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Or maybe

358
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,279
Let's just not even talk about that

359
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
Okay other two big things

360
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,143
One is mvnos for iot

361
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Connectivity

362
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
I think

363
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
There's a whole effort

364
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Taking place

365
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
With the platform companies like

366
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,871
Like a lion particle and those guys are introducing

367
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
Cellular

368
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:05,503
Platform cellular services for iot device makers in their acting

369
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
Kind of is an mvno

370
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
You're seeing them

371
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
Bucket a lot of options for

372
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
Carrier so

373
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
You don't have to do that yourself as

374
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
As a client

375
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,255
I think we're going to see an advancement on that

376
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
From other new entrance

377
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,119
Set the market like twilio there's some interesting things happen

378
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
And you're up here so I think we're going to see

379
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
Canada Slayer

380
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
This abstraction layer on

381
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
On top

382
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,335
Cellular connectivity the basically

383
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
Allows

384
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,175
People to connect your devices without having to

385
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Negotiate

386
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
The carriers

387
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
And that'll be

388
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
Worthwhile

389
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,599
I agreement already seen twilio for example start to do this

390
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
Put a data SIM cards at

391
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
You can use

392
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Variety device

393
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
Testing and so on

394
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
This is definitely

395
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
A shift from

396
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,839
What mvnos have done in the past which is offered

397
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,935
Were you would they would bundle up maybe text

398
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
Talk voice and

399
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
Data from

400
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,823
Bigger carriers Envy cell and smaller chunks

401
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Fourier

402
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
Cell phone plan for disabled

403
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,479
This is more I think you're towards industrial towards device makers

404
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
And so forth so

405
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
I would think

406
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,599
But that service would come with some devices and fat

407
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
I don't know if you probably pay a monthly subscription but

408
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
Yeah maybe they you don't have to provision

409
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,303
And some companies are basically saying hey

410
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
What connect your device

411
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,399
As long as it doesn't do more than this if this many mags

412
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Data

413
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
And this is the

414
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
And then they just

415
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
That allows come

416
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
To say all right

417
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
We're going to charge you this

418
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
And we

419
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Got to stay the same

420
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,455
So that'll be good and then there's also things like satellite

421
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,295
I think we'll hear a lot about in 2019

422
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,855
I'm curious how far will get into Act

423
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
Well Services

424
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,439
But they're definitely launching satellites and hoping to

425
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
Provide some sort of iot

426
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
Key service I just don't think

427
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
But I still question was busy

428
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
So

429
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,655
Just for me power consumption from a demand from

430
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Armacost

431
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Yeah

432
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,519
Well and then and I'm going to say and you're going to

433
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
Cringe

434
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,591
I got a mansion 5G cuz

435
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:11,455
If the big HuHot the end of 2018 with the first devices and hot spots and so on and so forth

436
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
And how it's going to change the out to world

437
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
No I don't think so in 29th

438
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,159
The world is not

439
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
It'll get gradually

440
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,791
All right and then my final prediction which will be really interesting

441
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
I think or in this is

442
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,679
But I think we're going to see a lot happening with voice program

443
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:37,055
Not necessarily for consumers although we seen that actually in the smart home but I think we're going to start seeing it

444
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,615
In like Amazon's AWS

445
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,943
I think you're going to start to be able to ask things of

446
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
Mattamy or maybe even Cortana

447
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:50,623
And you ask the assistant in the assistant will give you information about like your cloud

448
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Settings

449
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
What not

450
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
And that's going to be

451
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Really

452
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
Fun interesting

453
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
We'll see

454
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,839
It's interesting to me a minute and just from a programming standpoint

455
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,399
Can you interface a voice interface for

456
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
Making things happen better not

457
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Let's say

458
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
Static information

459
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
Is there any interest

460
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,615
Probably not for like your typical consumer but

461
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,663
Ouija collector stuff

462
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,223
Yeah well and I think consumers like it too cuz it makes me

463
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:21,343
Easier in so I'm interested like how is the syntax going to develop how do we actually implement this

464
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
Will there be a standard

465
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,231
Yes yes yes

466
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
Those are interesting I have a

467
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:35,679
Couple that I'll run through pretty quickly things that we may hear see etcetera at Cas and maybe some

468
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
Hopes and expectations for the year in the

469
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,031
I have to mention like we do every year

470
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,639
Siri and homekit because maybe 2019 will be the year for these

471
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Do you think

472
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,455
No I don't think so

473
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:53,855
Mention something just before the show and then neglected to put in the show notes but one of the Google headhunter

474
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,903
Just went over to Apple to work on

475
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,439
Voice interface AI

476
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,487
Yes yes John giannandrea

477
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,047
He actually had gone over there while back

478
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,095
I think he joined Apple

479
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
It was in April

480
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:09,983
A 2018 he went there from Google but now he's been promoted to their executive

481
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
So I think Apple's getting

482
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Serious

483
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
About

484
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
Siri

485
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,175
Yeah well I have to say 2018 was a bust

486
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
On that front for them

487
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,039
Because couple reasons I think most of them are obvious

488
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:28,415
And there's one that's maybe not so obviously wouldn't think it is the speakers and digital citizen cider

489
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,463
Proceeding aren't is the smartest ones

490
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
Are the most widely available

491
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Yes

492
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
Not everyone has

493
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,863
And iOS device for a homepod which

494
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,167
Really I mean I spell for a year now folks

495
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Yeah

496
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
Yeah that's almost say about that

497
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
Something started do I start to see in

498
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,151
2018 actually has been happening long as I suspect

499
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
I'm kind of

500
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
I don't say worried

501
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:56,063
About to be in Z-Wave but I'm seeing less of a place for them in this

502
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
Cloud connected API Centric

503
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,415
World of the Smart Hub

504
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,231
And it's funny because somebody just asked me the other day

505
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,023
I think I'm going to get the new

506
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
Echo hub

507
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,375
It has that extra radio and like what are you going to use it with

508
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
It'll do you have something to eat

509
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
ESAT radio

510
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
You like will know what do you use

511
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
For unlike

512
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
Yxz1000r

513
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,823
Sensors and things that are low power but

514
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
You don't have those no plan add those

515
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
Why are you buying the subpoena

516
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
You think I'm crazy on that

517
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
No no I have been

518
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
I've been thinking this

519
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,343
4 years right and it's still I mean Vivian Z-Wave silky

520
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,159
Trucking along but I do think they're going to find themselves

521
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
As mortgage

522
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Especially

523
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
Especially is Bluetooth

524
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Izhmash kit

525
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
Yep better

526
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,911
And integrated and more sensors cuz that's where you see zigbee and Z-Wave is in

527
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
Lights and sensors

528
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,983
Because you need low power in

529
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Wifikill

530
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
So

531
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,895
Yeah I know some people would be happy to hear that and hopefully I'm wrong

532
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
Maestro's people that's on my side

533
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,015
This year ended with an interesting twist

534
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
On the smart home user interface

535
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
It's not just voicemail

536
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,135
We're really getting more into

537
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671
Displays and I suspect

538
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
In 2019 will Seymour home dashboards

539
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,327
It may not just be like a smart displays from Google or the

540
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
Echo shows and so on

541
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,423
More integration with TVs and other display

542
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
Will Ferrell

543
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
Yeah and I think

544
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Contacts

545
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
Just going to really

546
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
You know we've talked about this for like

547
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,639
Using context is going to be the key to make

548
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
That work

549
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
Feel almost match

550
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
Ability to say oh this is the

551
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
Kind of contents

552
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,367
And that I should leads to another

553
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,439
Thought I have and I've been single for a couple years now.

554
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,743
The smart ones we have are actually not that smart

555
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:44,095
They just respond to things when we tell them to respond the things that respond to her voice with

556
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,887
Somewhat canned responses in

557
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,191
Skills and so on and so forth and actions

558
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,983
Yes you can set up routines and

559
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,519
Things like that I get that but

560
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
Where's the machine learning

561
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
Where is the Smart Hub getting

562
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,175
Smarter where maybe it notices a trend or pattern

563
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,223
Like you come home every day between 5 and 5

564
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,527
15 Saudi really need to have a

565
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,599
Smart light routine that turns the outside lights on at 5

566
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,391
No you know maybe you don't

567
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
You don't need to manually do that at

568
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,207
I can start doing things

569
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,535
Right now the smart home doesn't do much on its own

570
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
So I think

571
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,887
And hope that we'll see more in the AI and ml area

572
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
Here

573
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,191
And then laugh

574
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,727
Will two things

575
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:27,103
Smart speaker overload I'm already sick of it I have more smart speakers than I have room to put them in that

576
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
Could lead towards

577
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
Other devices

578
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,967
Mobile devices robots and sex

579
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
But have a speaker

580
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,063
And a microphone so we can get rid of all of these speakers

581
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
Don't know we want microphones everywhere speakers

582
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
Microphones

583
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,719
I don't think we need that and I'm not lying

584
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
Sorry

585
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,911
Okay I'm going to trust me I'm going to I'm going to be all over that robot section c you looking for this

586
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,239
You know I may come short but if not I'm going to say huh

587
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Last week

588
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,847
Something that we talked about our last show

589
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,919
I don't think a lot of these smart home device makers were really

590
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Prepare for the fast

591
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
I'll take a mesh Wi-Fi

592
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
So I really think this year

593
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,039
Newer products

594
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,855
Are just going to work with mesh WiFi and the reason is

595
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,135
Allow these devices have

596
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,975
Less capable Wi-Fi chips maybe only 2.4 gigahertz support

597
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,303
And so on and then you have dedicated network name and

598
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,839
On that channel or on that

599
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,887
How that would match so

600
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
I really think

601
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
That problem starts going away in

602
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
I hope

603
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
So

604
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
B2

605
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
Me too

606
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
All right

607
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
And I also

608
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,015
We're probably going to see I mean we've already seen this year I don't think

609
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,879
Less consolidation now I think we've established that Google home

610
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
And Amazon

611
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,183
Anime

612
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,743
I pretty much the King of the Hill when it comes to the

613
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
The kings of hell

614
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,559
When it comes to the consumer

615
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
King and queen

616
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
My

617
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,727
Yeah alright you could send you could have changed the voices

618
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,079
I was thinking of Google is but he and Madame a is but she I don't know why

619
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
We should not

620
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,503
It's hard to do when you have a robot though they can actually speak to one of these

621
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Delta Fire

622
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
IRobot

623
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
Okay

624
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
But

625
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,440
You don't Bixby

626
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
Cortana

627
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Who else is up

628
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
Siri

629
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
So

630
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
Who is our best and smartest

631
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,912
Smart speaker and we actually talked about this the newsletter. Last

632
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
Because we didn't have one last

633
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:28,960
But the way

634
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,008
Prior adventurous today

635
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,056
What color did i q test for

636
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
Smart speakers

637
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
And they discovered that

638
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,432
They tested both understanding of the inquiry

639
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
And then the ability to act

640
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,248
And Google

641
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
One out

642
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
Lake in a major way but

643
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,624
Where that bad I was actually pretty impressed

644
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
No no

645
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
I mean

646
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:54,304
When it comes to understanding the queries all of them at 99% or better which is good and just to be clear

647
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,864
The same questions were asked of each of these

648
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
General assistance

649
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,728
Hundred question so I think that's a pretty reasonable

650
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,032
Sample size actually unimpressive they did this

651
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,872
When it comes to answering correctly that tells you a lot

652
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,688
About who is truly smart and who is not in the

653
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,016
Space Google Assistant led the way with eighty seven point nine percent

654
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
Incorrectly

655
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,600
Siri was actually second at 74.6

656
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
1%

657
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
Surprise me

658
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:24,256
And then Madame a 72 and 1/2 in Cortana unfortunately 63.4%

659
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,048
Questions were answered correctly

660
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
But this leads

661
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,400
2y the big two are the big two in general

662
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
They have the biggest knowledge

663
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
Crafts I think

664
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
And they are against

665
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Sinner lyrics

666
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,848
The most widely available to capture data as well so

667
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,176
Bixby is not even part of the conversation here

668
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,808
Will Bixby has been out on phones for well over

669
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
2 years

670
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:53,184
On a Samsung phone again you're limited just like Siri or limit iOS

671
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,976
So that's a problem for Samsung

672
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:59,072
Additionally they don't have a search engine of their own they have a browser

673
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
On

674
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,376
Samsung devices but I don't

675
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
Tingting capture

676
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,704
Nearly as much data as anybody else

677
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,496
Honestly they have new

678
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,312
I'm going to say this is both a new business being in the space

679
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:14,688
They just don't inspect and in fact that Samsung Galaxy home speaker that looks like

680
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,992
Fondue pot

681
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,272
Coming soon I said

682
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,112
Which presently was before the end of the year I'm pretty sure they said before the end of the year

683
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:26,464
It is not available for sale yet and it is now 2019

684
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,744
A top of that

685
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
This is very telling to me

686
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,816
It was reported just

687
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
Last week

688
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,888
Apparently

689
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,984
Samsung may be partnering with Google to add Google Assistant to its

690
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,264
Smart TVs

691
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
Instead of or I guess

692
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,848
Alongside of Bixby

693
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
That's

694
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,408
Waving the white flag with right there

695
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,200
Yes

696
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
That is

697
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,016
But I mean it's kind of necessary

698
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
Yukata

699
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,088
If necessary if your

700
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,880
Google assistant is junk yes

701
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,696
I mean I know I sound cranky about this but I sat

702
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
Through a 90 minutes

703
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,512
Samsung CES press event

704
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,584
Last year and it was all SmartThings

705
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
It was all

706
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Bixby

707
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
Higher primate

708
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
Lifeline ovens

709
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
Bridges

710
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
Sode and 28

711
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
18 did

712
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:17,920
Switch from the original SmartThings to the new integrated SmartThings that can talk to lots of

713
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
Samsung

714
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,272
You're so they did in a great and that's

715
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:26,880
If you think about it they had special apps for the refrigerator special apps for their

716
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,952
Televisions and they brought it all under the smart

717
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,256
Plan was bring it all into SmartThings

718
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
In that app

719
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
I don't know if

720
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
Everything is very yet

721
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:36,864
But a lot of it is

722
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:41,216
Well I haven't looked at the app in a while several months I should say and

723
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:44,800
Just transitioning from the SmartThings classic app to the new one was

724
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Horrendous

725
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
Horrendous user experience

726
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,408
And if you look at the reviews of those apps

727
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,504
A lot of people are not happy we're not happy at the time with the new app

728
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,832
So it's probably worth a revisit I'm going to wait until

729
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,624
The dog and pony show at CES

730
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,416
And then I will take another look at it

731
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,696
Take a gander

732
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,256
Yes I have been playing I played with SmartThings

733
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
Just a month.

734
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
It was

735
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,096
The transition was horrendous

736
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
Yes you're right

737
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
Things

738
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:15,776
Still work as anticipated I don't have any smart Samsung appliances so I couldn't bring anything

739
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:20,640
I just don't have anything that I could have brought over and I was going to buy a new washer and dryer or anything crazy

740
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,712
So it's a little hard for me

741
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
How to test exactly

742
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
What it's like to break in the news

743
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,600
But the old stuff they smoothed it out

744
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
So it works

745
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
For the most

746
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
Right and I'm not

747
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:38,816
I want it kind of exclude like a SmartThings ecosystem and the Hub and products because

748
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,840
It's really good

749
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,680
It's not bad it's the whole Bixby thing that aspect of it

750
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,984
Has rubbed me the wrong way since they launched it

751
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,056
And all of my experience with it as backup my

752
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,360
You know I guess you could say preconception

753
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,176
Which maybe isn't fair but still it just isn't

754
00:25:54,432 --> 00:26:00,576
It's good they cannot yet compete I don't see how they can compete again they don't have the back end of information

755
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,624
Google or an Amazon have

756
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,904
Okay well

757
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
That was a lot of cranky

758
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,976
Kevin we don't see a little cranky Kevin

759
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,792
I had to get it all out

760
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,096
I'll be good for the rest of the year I promise

761
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
Senior and Kevin

762
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,704
Okay well let's blow through some news.

763
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Real fast

764
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
So we got a test

765
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,056
Or drone deliveries

766
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,384
And oh people love the fact that they can get their stuff in

767
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
A few hours

768
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,968
And other people who are not getting their stuff

769
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Few hours hate

770
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
The fact that drones are noisy

771
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,856
Yeah the funny thing is this is happening now in Australia

772
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
These are up past

773
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,928
Program from wings

774
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,232
Which is a subsidiary of alphabet

775
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:45,632
And I've had drugs before and one of the things is yeah they can be a little noisy but I think the bigger issue and some people are

776
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,656
Complaining about it

777
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,448
The ultrasonic frequencies

778
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
From a drone motor

779
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Tribes

780
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
McCann Drive

781
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Pets

782
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Crazy

783
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,104
Scares the bejesus out of

784
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,432
My dog for example I actually got rid of my drone because

785
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:02,016
At the dog I couldn't hear what he was hearing but boy he did not like it

786
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Yes

787
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
We also have

788
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,880
Research for the University of Singapore on

789
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
Power saving

790
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,440
Powri

791
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
How would you describe

792
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:17,120
I would say that this is a addition to sensor technology that could

793
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,192
Allow the sensor to wake up when it's needed

794
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,008
Basically cut the power consumption down

795
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
Apparently by at least

796
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
1000 time

797
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,360
Down to the Pika watt range

798
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
And that's because

799
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,784
You don't in certain use cases need a sensor on all the time it doesn't need to be drawing power from its battery

800
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,064
Turn electricity Etc

801
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:40,928
You just need it when it's needed and I know that's hard to predict so I don't know how this is going to be

802
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
Implemented

803
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,744
But the technology seems to be promising

804
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,304
Thanks for that if we can figure out the right algorithm

805
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,864
Sensors will be using nearly as much

806
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Battery power

807
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Always

808
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Always

809
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
It's a good thing

810
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,752
We got some new samsara

811
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
Which

812
00:27:55,776 --> 00:28:00,384
They launched a while back they've been an iot platform they were going to be very generic

813
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,432
And then they really honed in on

814
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
Honda vehicles

815
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
They have raised

816
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,016
A hundred million dollars

817
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,832
At a 3.6 billion dollar valuation

818
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,880
This is mostly for fleet manager

819
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,440
And cars and trucks and

820
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,744
It makes a lot of sense the guys who found a Sims

821
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
Sorrow with the founders

822
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,840
Meraki in the idea that they had there was

823
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
You basically

824
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,424
Wife I was getting really complicated as people

825
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,728
Brought more devices into an Enterprise

826
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
Corporate Network

827
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,776
MBA Rocky they built

828
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Special

829
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,568
Router Xanax

830
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
Plus software that made that a lot

831
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,200
That's kind of the idea with samsara

832
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,760
Oh my gosh will bring you all these connected

833
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,576
Sensors on board and we need both a new

834
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,112
Radio technology in

835
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,392
Software to manage the

836
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,720
Ended up going with was saying okay

837
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,744
That's too big that's

838
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
Debride

839
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,048
We're just going to do this for

840
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
Fleet manager

841
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:51,840
So

842
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
This is a good thing it's

843
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
Glad to hear it I have been cut

844
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:00,800
I have worried about them but there's a lot of iot platforms out there that are not going to make it so I'm glad to see

845
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,384
These guys well-funded and apparently doing really well in their selected

846
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,224
They aren't they are very well-funded because this

847
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,040
Raises their total funding UPS 230 million

848
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:16,160
And the company says they haven't even used any other previous round of funding

849
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,976
So I don't know what kind of plans they have it must be big

850
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,256
Yeah it a lot of

851
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,048
Companies are anticipating a

852
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,840
A big Market turn down

853
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
2019

854
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,656
So it's probably wise up

855
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,960
Get the money while you can

856
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,032
Especially in an area like iot platforms

857
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,640
Okay and another news Google they got FCC approval at the

858
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,432
Fairy end-of-the-year witch

859
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,480
Good actually cuz the FCC is going

860
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
Part of the government shutdown

861
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,064
They got RCC approval for

862
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,624
A project soli which uses

863
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
Radar

864
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,672
Is a 60 gigahertz

865
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,280
To detect your gestures so the idea that used it

866
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
QQ sisters tag gestures

867
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
On fabric

868
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
Skin on whatever

869
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,984
You want and you can use it to control screen

870
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,776
This was actually launched at

871
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
Same time project

872
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
Card was

873
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,384
Wei Wei Wei back in like

874
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
The 2015

875
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,736
I think so I think so at the Levi's jacket

876
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,272
Yeah and so

877
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,600
So we haven't gone places and one of the reasons is

878
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,416
That they couldn't get it at a high enough power

879
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,464
Experimental license

880
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
Search for the SEC to play with this

881
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
But they couldn't get

882
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,072
Enough power to get accuracy

883
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
The Chester

884
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,376
So this

885
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
Latest

886
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,936
Approval gives them

887
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
Basically

888
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,728
Moore DDS

889
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,360
It lets them transmit at a higher power so hopefully that will improve the resolution

890
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Of

891
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
The gesture

892
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
Understand

893
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,712
That's being nice

894
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
I can see the

895
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,528
Immediate use

896
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
For people who have

897
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,856
In fact in the news release dimensions

898
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,184
This could benefit users with Mobility or speech impairment cuz

899
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
Can you speak to the great you are but not everybody can use it

900
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
So I get that

901
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,072
I wonder if it has to be

902
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,632
Combined with something physical like a

903
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,912
Jacquard project

904
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,448
Jacquard jacket for example

905
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
I'm thinking not

906
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:10,080
I'm thinking because it's right are you could literally have a virtual on off switch

907
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,896
Ukraine yes mr. fingers in the air and

908
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:16,224
Something turn on in your house for example so it's in a sentence

909
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,576
Like voice as always said as the invisible interface innocent This truly is

910
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
Invisible interface

911
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,880
Yes and

912
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,696
Right now they're using 60 gigahertz in a couple

913
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:31,328
I think last month I wrote about likewise 60 gigahertz was so interesting for The Internet of Things

914
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,400
And I talked about like fall detection and some of the other

915
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,168
Cool things

916
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,448
The companies are doing with this

917
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,728
Can somebody actually pointed out

918
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,520
Comments that project soli

919
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,288
Uses it

920
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
As well so you're right

921
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,408
And it's a very prescient statement this could be like the other invisible

922
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,224
All right and now

923
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,016
It is time for our

924
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,552
Iot podcast

925
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,344
Hotline before we get to

926
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,184
This week's question I have to fix an answer

927
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,976
From last week's episode

928
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,000
Our answer was

929
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,536
Drawing a chest

930
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,072
It was like the wrong way

931
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,608
And I apologize

932
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,888
Price for that you guys I

933
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
I don't know why my brain decides to

934
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,240
Things to post difficult way except it's

935
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:14,080
It's on me to both of us neglected to recognize the native

936
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,152
Madam a says function that's in the matinee app

937
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,432
I will defend myself

938
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
Anime app

939
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Experience is

940
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,784
Horrible trap rap

941
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,576
Mine even the guy who I

942
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,904
I hired someone from Amazon to come and play with matinee at my house

943
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,696
Probably a couple months ago

944
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
Wow you're a prime so slow it's

945
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,072
Terrible and I was like I know

946
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:35,840
But

947
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,864
The question was

948
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,448
Basically how can I have an audible notification that

949
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,752
Like my door is open or a sensor status is

950
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,544
And the answer

951
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
Is

952
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,896
You can use a routine so a lot of people are using

953
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
SmartThings

954
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
For like

955
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,784
Their sensor management cuz Madame a does not handle a lot of sensor

956
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
But you

957
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,624
Basically use SmartThings for

958
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
This sensor has

959
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,928
Change state

960
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,976
Right so you put that in there

961
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
As part of your route

962
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
When this happens

963
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
SmartThings

964
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,584
That's your trigger event

965
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,144
SmartThings motion sensor triggered

966
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,168
Then do this

967
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,728
And then do this you just go to

968
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,776
It's called I'm going to say it you guys

969
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,056
Cover her ears

970
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
Alexa says

971
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,640
So you so like that and then you say

972
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,432
What does she say so you can write down

973
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
The door is open

974
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
I saw a dog whatever you want

975
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,320
How to say and you can set the volume

976
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
End

977
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,368
That's how this works

978
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,416
And it actually is easy yes

979
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,232
Samantha River before

980
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,024
Like notifications we hated it

981
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,328
We thought it was clunky as all get-out

982
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,888
And realize there are some pre-canned

983
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,704
The responses in there you have to use the custom command if you want

984
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,520
Something like he knows the back door it's open

985
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:52,640
This light was left on for more than 15 minutes excetera this is a great feature yes we missed it

986
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:56,224
It gets back to my smart home really isn't that smart

987
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,784
Thinking out this stuff chew just happened in a sense

988
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
LOD irritating

989
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
Felix shut up

990
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
Cadillac the alarm set

991
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,440
System that beeps whenever anything happens and you

992
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,744
And thank you guys

993
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
We had a bunch of you

994
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,560
Send it in

995
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,352
Really nice messages like

996
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120

I don't know maybe you guys didn't see this but so

998
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
Thanks for letting us know

999
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,264
Oh and thanks for everyone who sent that in

1000
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
It's like High

1001
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,568
You could do it this way

1002
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:27,456
They were very gracious to us

1003
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
All right

1004
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
Now

1005
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,296
We will go to

1006
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
Two more things

1007
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
1

1008
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,648

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,520
And I will go to the question

1020
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
For this

1021
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
And I have to tell you that

1022
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
Once again

1023
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896

Schlage electronic locks can make life

It's so much easier and more convenient

1028
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,136
No more keeping track of x

1029
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904

1035
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
From

1036
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
Heaven

1037
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,960
Not this Kevin

1038
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
A different Kevin

1039
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,264
Let's hear it

1040
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
Stacy

1041
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
In Raleigh

1042
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
South Carolina

1043
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,944
My questions really about

1044
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
Ecosystem

1045
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,272
We have the ring doorbell

1046
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,552
And now as a

1047
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,088
Scarcity

1048
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
Everything else in the house

1049
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,952
Is Google Assistant

1050
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,256
Parts for the iPhone but that's

1051
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,864
Question is my going to have to

1052
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,912
Amazon Echo

1053
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,408
At work

1054
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,456
To actually be able to do things like

1055
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
Go in the back door

1056
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
Podcast

1057
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,744
Kevin this is such an important topic that I asked

1058
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,024
She was going to write a post about it be

1059
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,304
I'm so frustrated

1060
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,608
The short answer is you

1061
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
Can't connect your ring doorbell

1062
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
To your Google

1063
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,336
But you can't do what you probably most want to do

1064
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,360
Which is C

1065
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
Who's at the door

1066
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
Right now

1067
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
Google

1068
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Support

1069
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
The ability to

1070
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,016
Take a video doorbell in

1071
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
Connected to

1072
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,576
What your Google home device

1073
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,368
And even Google displays

1074
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,904
And Google Chromecast

1075
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
But ring

1076
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,232
Does not allow for

1077
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,536
So and I don't know if that's because

1078
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,328
Has Google and ring are talking

1079
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,680
Or what the deal is but ring right now in ring actually for a while did not come

1080
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,240
But the Amazon stuff easily as well so it may be a

1081
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
But ring will let you

1082
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:03,872
Talk to your ring doorbell through Google home you can ask it about

1083
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
When your doorbell

1084
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
A string

1085
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
You can ask it starting to

1086
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
Recording

1087
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,504
Ask it to turn on motion alerts

1088
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,296
But you can't see who's at your door

1089
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
Right

1090
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,856
And I suspect

1091
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,928
It's less about Ring not talking to Google then it is about

1092
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:21,280
Amazon not wanting to talk to Google about this since Amazon bought ring last year

1093
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,608
So yes the short answer is you can connect it

1094
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,912
The longer answer is you can connect it and get

1095
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
Some basic information

1096
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,984
Probably not the visual and

1097
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
Information your look

1098
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
Dissolution

1099
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
I hate to say it you guys

1100
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
Is Topeka Niko

1101
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,408
Google home

1102
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,944
If you're going to be on Google home

1103
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,760
The Nest hello doorbell which is an awesome door

1104
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,552
Both the ring and the nest

1105
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,576
Storehouse RS

1106
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,392
Excellent I think the nest is actually a better doorbell because

1107
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,696
It's a little bit faster in the

1108
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,232
Facial recognition on it is

1109
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,256
Phenomenal

1110
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
So I'm actually

1111
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:57,888
You're looking for the best video doorbell and that's your focus I say go with the nest hello

1112
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,936
Which means you'd be a Google Echo

1113
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
Ecosystem

1114
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,288
And so if you're in the Google ecosystem already

1115
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,824
Take back your ring man

1116
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,896
Captain's get the nest hello

1117
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
It's going to do everything you want

1118
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,552
Are the echo ecosystem

1119
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,112
Yeah don't get a nest

1120
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:18,880
Because

1121
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,160
Google is not going to

1122
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,696
It goes so far and I don't

1123
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Time soon

1124
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
Will give

1125
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
The video app

1126
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
AP Iced Out

1127
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
So

1128
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
Then you want to be in the ring

1129
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,632
Which is a really good doorbell in

1130
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,960
They have to be getting closer on the better

1131
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,728
Facial

1132
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
Recognition and understand

1133
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,544
Yeah it's

1134
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,896
I mean it's just disappointing though that you have to pick an ecosystem for

1135
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
Akira lock your

1136
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
Doorbell

1137
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
I would say

1138
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,552
It's really only for those.

1139
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,600
Like video cameras

1140
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,904
If you want to see it on your home display

1141
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
And your door

1142
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,768
Like sensors you can pull in through a variety of platforms

1143
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,560
Even Arlo if you want to

1144
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
You know maybe

1145
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
I want to get the video doorbell just

1146
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,656
Popping Arlo out there and

1147
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,704
Then you can do a lot of things

1148
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
I don't know

1149
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
It's not everything

1150
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
It's just those thing

1151
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,800
Store

1152
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,128
And at the shame that all while it could be an alarm system

1153
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,688
To but the shame of it all is

1154
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,248
We should have seen this coming because

1155
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:21,088
Google Nest came from Google and then went back in to Google

1156
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
Spun out

1157
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,672
Alphabet and then went back to Google and then

1158
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:28,512
As we said Amazon bought ring that's when you start seeing the sideways go up

1159
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,048
And that's that's the disappointing

1160
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,864
So yes we are in Silo territory

1161
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,912
Kevin I'm sorry to tell you this

1162
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,704
That is our advice on this

1163
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
And

1164
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,776
Guys if you have a question for us

1165
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
Please

1166
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
Give us a call at 5 1/2

1167
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
6 to 3

1168
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
742 4

1169
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:48,224
The answer may not always be what you want to hear

1170
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,344
It would guarantee an answer we just can't guarantee one that you like

1171
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,136
All right

1172
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,696
Well that concludes this portion of the show

1173
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:03,072
And stay tuned for Scott MacDonald of mcrock capital who is going to be talking about

1174
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
The big shift

1175
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
Leptin

1176
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,656
Enterprise and Industrial iot

1177
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,936
Basically

1178
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:12,288
The last five years have been one thing and now we're getting ready for the next five years

1179
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,080
And will you guys be per

1180
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
Prepared

1181
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,616
Find out

1182
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,664
After a message for this week sponsor

1183
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:24,832
Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor

1184
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,672
Sweet sponsor is digicert and I have Mike Nelson who is VP

1185
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,720
Of iot security at

1186
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,024
Can you remind our listeners

1187
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,560
What it is that digicert

1188
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,120
Dad the desert is the world's

1189
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
Leading provider of

1190
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,008
Scalable Security Solutions for identity and encryption and we provide these Solutions

1191
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
Search for web servers

1192
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,104
Enterprise security and my favorite

1193
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,384
Of course iot

1194
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,432
Mike we learned a lot about the survey.

1195
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:55,296
Theraclear benefits to organizations prioritizing and implementing iot

1196
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
Security

1197
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,112
Can you tell us about some of the ways that the

1198
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:02,976
Successful organizations are benefiting to a handful of group

1199
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,816
They were talk to your organization's that demonstrated a Mastery of iotc

1200
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:13,216
Security middle-tier and then the bottom tier of courts are organizations that really struggling to master coyotes

1201
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,544
Security and the difference between the top and the bottom tier

1202
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
Was shocking

1203
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:21,664
Every one of the bottom chair organizations have experienced a security mishap

1204
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
Things like denial

1205
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:27,040
Service or malware compared to just 32%

1206
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,064
Of the top-tier

1207
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,648
The bottom tier was much more likely to have reported problems

1208
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,672
In those areas

1209
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
They were

1210
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,256
Nearly six times as likely to experience

1211
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,280
Data breaches

1212
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,096
And unauthorized access to iot devices

1213
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:44,704
Compared to the top care and spell the survey for my perspective it really highlights that

1214
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,520
The things of the top-tier organizations are doing

1215
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:51,360
Priority security are working and in protecting their organizations

1216
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:55,711
So where should organizations start when building an iot security strategy

1217
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:02,367
My recommendation for organizations is there looking to stand up and iot security practices first of all to make

1218
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,647
Make sure that they build

1219
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,951
Security into the DNA of the way there

1220
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:12,351
Developing their products and that would mean everything from making sure that they think about cyber security in the architecture in the design

1221
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,167
Testing for cyber security man in the

1222
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:18,495
Employment making sure that you're doing the things that are continually

1223
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,543
And keep your devices secure

1224
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:26,175
So we asked to talk to your organization's the things that they were doing that were leading them to be successful without you

1225
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
Security and they gave us five

1226
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,247
Sphinx the first was

1227
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,271
Scalability

1228
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:36,671
Of their solution to making sure that the scale of the solution they put in place will just meet their needs for today

1229
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:40,767
But also five years down the road making sure that they're doing Integrity check

1230
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,327
On any package that's being sent to the device

1231
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:47,423
Doing authentication on all connections coming to and from the device

1232
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,287
To make sure no unauthenticated connection or person can get into the device

1233
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,847
Reviewing and Performing risk assessment

1234
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:59,711
Is always important to understand the vulnerabilities of the device and then finally and of course

1235
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,503
Encryption of sensitive data

1236
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:05,599
And making sure that you're encrypting data both at rest and also in transit

1237
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,647
Thanks bike that's excellent advice

1238
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:11,487
So where can people go to learn more about the survey and Digicel

1239
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:16,607
Yeah the full details of the survey can be found on our website at digicert. Com

1240
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,631
Forward slash

1241
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,167
Iot security

1242
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:33,503
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

1243
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,063
Scott McDonald who is a managing partner

1244
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,343
And co-founder at

1245
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,623
Mcrock capital

1246
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
Hi Scott how are you doing

1247
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,463
Eddie Stacy I'm doing well how are you

1248
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:48,095
I am excellent I'm excited to kick off the new year with you as our first guest on

1249
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:48,863
On the show

1250
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,495
Partially because you have a great theory that I think it's going to set us up nicely for a big trend

1251
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,775
In 2009

1252
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,847
18 and also because your firm invests

1253
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,407
Heavily in industrial iot

1254
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,711
Let's just get this started

1255
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:07,551
Talk to us a little bit about what you've been investing in in the last

1256
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
Few years

1257
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,599
And what you think is

1258
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,623
Is going to change

1259
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,391
In the coming year

1260
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,439
Well I'm excited to be on

1261
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,279
Thank you for having me and what weight on my shoulders

1262
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
Takeoff

1263
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,375
2019 talking about all things iot

1264
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,679
You're right mcrock capital has

1265
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,263
Exclusively on the industrial side of the IRT

1266
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,543
The past 7 years

1267
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,383
Was raised in 15

1268
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,735
70 million-dollar spoke exclusively on the industrial side of the iot

1269
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,759
2 back then

1270
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,807
What we really were looking at

1271
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,879
Was the collection of data

1272
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,903
Machines

1273
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,767
And the conductivity of that data so I have an analogy that I use

1274
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,815
That the coyote

1275
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,863
Can be the body and the Brain

1276
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,399
Are there two different portions

1277
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,447
As we evolve through the iot

1278
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,007
And the last five years has been about

1279
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:04,383
Data from equipment machines and sensors and connecting it and in some ways

1280
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
Cleansing data

1281
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,711
But it really has been a data play

1282
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,735
Setopati

1283
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,295
And in the next 5 years were singing

1284
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,319
Just now

1285
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:17,951
To the real disruptor side of iot which is the analytics I now that we have all this

1286
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
Is dark data

1287
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,303
Start to do things with it using machine learning and AI

1288
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,839
General Analytics

1289
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,863
It's going to drive

1290
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,447
Huge disruption in Big Industry and it's going to drive

1291
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
Productivity

1292
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,311
Okay and you just use the phrase dark data

1293
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,079
What does that mean

1294
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,871
The dark data is

1295
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,895
Unintelligent

1296
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,663
It's just

1297
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,943
Tech data

1298
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,759
Is a building block of some value creation

1299
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,319
But until you do something with the data and

1300
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,087
Recognize

1301
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,623
Patterns are deaf.

1302
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,671
So what

1303
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
Which is dark data

1304
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:55,839
State of it's not doing anything it doesn't have any meaning to it that's where analytics comes into play

1305
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,119
We've been hearing a lot of

1306
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,911
Machine learning

1307
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
But we're starting

1308
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,519
Really see a lot of connection technology

1309
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
Become intelligent

1310
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
So that's me

1311
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
Take that dark data

1312
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,871
You apply Analytics

1313
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,151
And now

1314
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:13,503
You know but she was are not only being able to send their actually becoming aware

1315
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,039
They're starting to

1316
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,343
Make predictions are starting to act

1317
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,671
So it's one thing to have a recognition of what

1318
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,719
Call it

1319
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,279
Current state

1320
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,815
Telling people they suck

1321
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,399
So you think about a machine that's running

1322
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,679
It's not optimized

1323
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,519
It's not doing a very good job it's that your production line is not very efficient

1324
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,799
Is there a y

1325
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:43,711
What you really need to do is now take corrective action and automate the whole process not swear this

1326
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,503
Play

1327
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,527
So we go from

1328
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
Learning

1329
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:52,671
From the data from the machines what's actually happening as they talks to us then we need

1330
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,975
Better way to operate them through AI

1331
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,255
Now the finals

1332
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:00,351
Feedback loop is when software also then take the autocorrect option

1333
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:05,215
And changes the way that they're behaving in this is not using the word machine

1334
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,031
Traffic light so that you can have it

1335
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,311
Control in a city

1336
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,359
And start to figure out how many

1337
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,407
Cars are at an intersection

1338
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,455
2 * 2

1339
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,735
In real time

1340
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,759
Traffic lights

1341
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
I like that

1342
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,599
There's no Roi in telling someone that they say

1343
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,391
I like that a lot

1344
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,719
So if we go by the story which I think is totally accurate

1345
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,255
Which must be why I had

1346
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
You come on that show

1347
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,839
The last five years have been about hooking up

1348
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,143
Machines getting the data

1349
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
Getting the body

1350
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:35,935
Of the iot

1351
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,727
And then the AIS pek

1352
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,031
Back to being the brain and then starting to do something

1353
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,871
What that what if in the last 5 years you've been reading about the

1354
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,431
Maybe we should try that

1355
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:49,247
Kind of dipping your toe in the water but you're not there yet

1356
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:52,319
Are these companies that have not built out the body yet are they behind

1357
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,599
Skylark

1358
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,391
Companies that build up the body

1359
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,927
You know we speak a lot

1360
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,743
Large corporations that say things like

1361
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
We want

1362
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,119
Cuz they have the angle they know what they want cuz there's r a y

1363
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,911
So they go to the

1364
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,191
Thing that they need

1365
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,239
What they don't have is

1366
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,263
Everything

1367
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,031
Equipment

1368
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:12,799
Connected

1369
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,079
Whether it's wired on

1370
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,895
Leflore weather it's wireless

1371
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
Pieces of equipment

1372
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,199
We've been monitoring

1373
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,479
Will high levels

1374
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:25,087
Statistics try to map out where we are in the evolution of the eye

1375
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,439
For the first time have dropped below 100% kegger so

1376
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,487
This year they were about 91:4

1377
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,535
Sam Insidious years they were

1378
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,071
Hop in the hundred and thirty

1379
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,863
Percent growth rate now

1380
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,423
Other areas like monthly Revenue

1381
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,775
As it relates to machine machine is still in the early days and it's

1382
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,055
Just starting to grow

1383
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,103
Is that monthly revenue for providing cut

1384
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:47,871
Activity

1385
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,895
To these machines

1386
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,431
It's hard

1387
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,711
Coppell glass

1388
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:56,063
Be careful with that one because it is hard to tell whether it's just connectivity or that serve

1389
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,135
But it is M2M Market Revenue

1390
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:03,487
Is got 12% kegger and you know we're still at planet in the

1391
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
300 billion range

1392
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,095
Which is again I suspect probably has

1393
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:11,935
Large number already

1394
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,775
Your question around where are companies

1395
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,823
That may not be

1396
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,127
Including instrumented and sensor Dell

1397
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,407
I think they're not

1398
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,687
Far behind

1399
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,991
Because of technology and Innovation now

1400
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:25,759
Shekinah

1401
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:32,159
Walk-in different ways to access machine data and a lot of equipment is being built with sensor

1402
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,207
It just wasn't used for different

1403
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,279
Again I go back to my turn

1404
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,583
This there it's sitting there it's sort of

1405
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,351
Trout

1406
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
And now

1407
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,167
Dilaudid

1408
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,959
Spiders that are helping me

1409
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,983
Operations

1410
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
Connect

1411
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,543
An access. Data

1412
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,335
So you could catch up really quick

1413
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,615
I don't think anyone is

1414
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,407
Materially behind the best

1415
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,759
If I'm thinking about making Investments

1416
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,039
And I'm looking at

1417
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,343
Getting to the dark date or even maybe

1418
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,367
Doing something

1419
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,183
Is it too late for me to invest in those

1420
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:08,511
Company should I be starting up an analytics company this pointer

1421
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,071
A data cleansing company where should I be sinking

1422
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,119
If I'm doing something

1423
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
Now

1424
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:20,031
Going forward and looking into the future and that's sort of our prediction that are from

1425
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:24,127
Seeing a lot of Hardware a lot of what we would call the body type in Destiny

1426
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,943
We dabbled into the brain side into

1427
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
Analytics

1428
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:31,807
With a company called noodle in Montreal

1429
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,415
We were waiting for a lot of people to

1430
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,231
Septic systems up and running before they were ready

1431
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,535
Sirius Analytics

1432
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,071
They had to get the body though

1433
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,351
Looking forward

1434
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,167
You're crashing but we're looking for in the future

1435
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,983
I think we really looking at the analytics I

1436
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,775
Looking at companies that actually can

1437
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,079
A call that dating now in a lot of these companies

1438
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,871
Will be at your place awkward

1439
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,175
Some will still have a hard-working

1440
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,015
And there's also another area that I kind of put

1441
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,319
Andaman with analytics which is

1442
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,343
Cyber security

1443
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,135
And that's a whole nother area but

1444
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,159
Need that is

1445
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,207
Analogy body in the brain

1446
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,743
Cyber security

1447
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:12,767
Analytics

1448
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,791
Are the brain

1449
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:18,399
And they are becoming more and more important as one cementation

1450
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,191
Elmer conductivity

1451
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,007
Got it and let's take him to some of this

1452
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,615
So what's important if you're going to be the analytics or the brain side

1453
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,151
Let's break this down a little bit

1454
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,431
Got to have

1455
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,455
I talked to

1456
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,503
Dozens of companies each week that

1457
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:37,855
If they're like we're doing AI for iot your AI for business transformation

1458
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,903
What do they do

1459
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
Be able to

1460
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,743
Tudo how much room is in there for a variety of different

1461
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,303
Well

1462
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,095
If I broke down the Analytics

1463
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,375
Landscape

1464
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:54,239
There are number of companies that are doing well almost call Professional Services

1465
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,007
So

1466
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,031
They have hired

1467
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,335
Very intelligent data scientist

1468
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,639
And they work with corporations

1469
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,407
2

1470
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,943
Analyze data sets

1471
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,711
To try to

1472
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:10,111
Understand what the angle of the customer to say why do you want a eye what are you trying to accomplish

1473
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,951
And there's a few different reactions in the biggest ones come to

1474
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,975
Well we think there's

1475
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:19,327
Value Adder productivity gains that can be hot if we analyze how our operation

1476
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:26,495
The other one is usually around people and how people interface and maybe customizing the way someone engages effect now

1477
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,287
Ecology on a personal level

1478
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,615
It's a different people at different angles for Yai

1479
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,407
But when you look back at the pipes

1480
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,431
Companies there are

1481
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,711
You have a

1482
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,991
Handful

1483
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:40,319
Of Technology businesses that are developing software

1484
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
Not very many

1485
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,927
Which are almost plug-and-play like jamming to dataset in

1486
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:48,767
And it's going to go look for pattern recognition and it's going to start to discover things

1487
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,095
There are other companies that have

1488
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,655
Really sophisticated teams of smart people

1489
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,935
Where they are at

1490
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:58,751
Assisting in the learning of the AI

1491
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,775
Solar still

1492
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:06,175
Humans are still handling the data and the touch is still higher than everyone believes marketing wise you wouldn't know that but

1493
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,199
Experian

1494
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,735
And says it's very

1495
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,015
Hand holding

1496
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,295
AI data analytics

1497
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,575
So we're getting there

1498
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,855
Denver RC

1499
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,415
True revolutionary

1500
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:21,023
The Shelf software technologies that are designed for here let me give you a real example

1501
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,047
Something around

1502
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,327
A specific type of

1503
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,655
And so it will have an agent machine learning agent

1504
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:30,495
It starts to recognize certain situations and correlate

1505
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Failure

1506
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,359
I'm a piece of equipment based on things like temperature vibration

1507
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,407
The different sensor readings

1508
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,943
And it will start to map

1509
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,479
Predictions on

1510
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,503
Tell your time

1511
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,599
Weather 7 Days 15 days 30 days and it's a

1512
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,391
Self-learning algorithm

1513
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,927
So and it's run on

1514
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,719
Bunch of different machines

1515
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,255
Across the world

1516
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
Pacific time

1517
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:56,095
And every time there's a new state that identify

1518
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,655
Turtle runs parallel experiment

1519
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:01,983
To see if it's just a new statement the new operating State that's fine

1520
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,311
Or if it's actually a failure mode and indication of failure mode

1521
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,079
And so

1522
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,615
That truly is

1523
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,175
Predictive Analytics cuz you're actually running

1524
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,991
Algorithm that constantly learning

1525
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:15,295
About every different type of sensor

1526
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,343
Be back and then trying to the

1527
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,391
Text when there's an anomaly

1528
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
That actually

1529
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,695
Can lead to failure and then

1530
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,743
True experience of data

1531
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,047
Figure out if it's 5 days or if its 50 days

1532
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,351
And then she can start to take real action

1533
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,375
Got it

1534
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
Okay

1535
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,935
That does sound actually really cool

1536
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,983
So now let's turn to Cyrus

1537
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:34,751
Security

1538
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,775
It's kind of the same Quest

1539
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:40,127
Which is when we're thinking about industrial iot or just

1540
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,407
Iot in general

1541
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,735
Cybersecurity is a huge field what are the types of

1542
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,807
Solutions that we really need what is different

1543
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,575
About Cyprus

1544
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:51,391
Security for industrial iot that we should be thick

1545
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,159
Thinking about

1546
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,719
Well the one area that I'm really excited

1547
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:58,559
2019 S10

1548
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,375
That anytime a device connect

1549
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,143
Turn Network

1550
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:08,799
And you see the devices we see that are vulnerable the ones that are outside the firewall of Noah traditional

1551
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,823
Security system

1552
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,871
Inside of a cyber kind

1553
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,431
Security perimeter

1554
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,711
To the network wireless

1555
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,247
Whatever way that wireless

1556
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,575
I know everyone thinks wife I usually when we say Wireless

1557
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,599
There are different types

1558
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,671
Analogies in the Spectrum

1559
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:28,767
Just like a new open window any device connected the new open window

1560
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,839
That hackers can get into and call around and what we

1561
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,887
Seen so far in the last couple years

1562
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,447
Is that the weaponizing devices

1563
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,775
Just anything from routers the back of police cars 2

1564
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,055
Smart TV

1565
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,591
Those can be used

1566
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,919
Kind of tax where they just tryna

1567
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,199
You just trying to

1568
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,735
Clogged

1569
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,783
The internet and take down certain

1570
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:57,183
So they're trying to be clever and sneaky that way in there as I call it weaponizing iot device

1571
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:59,999
But it's not really trying to hack the device

1572
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,303
So now we're starting to see more

1573
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,071
Pacific

1574
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:03,839
Cases

1575
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,375
I guess attacks

1576
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,679
That are much more professionally done

1577
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,703
And there

1578
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,495
Dedicated and targeted

1579
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,031
So they know what the device is

1580
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,335
Listening to be really simple like

1581
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:17,919
Taking over the screens inside a airport

1582
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,479
Taking it down and then holding them for ransom to say

1583
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:25,343
No one knows what gates are going to Orlando flights are leaving our departing in a large Airport

1584
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,111
Because

1585
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,671
We basically take control of all that displays

1586
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,207
And again Wireless

1587
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,255
Tends to be the area of vulnerability

1588
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
The word

1589
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,071
Wishing very little

1590
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,375
Quickest way most companies don't even

1591
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,935
Have an idea of what the wireless

1592
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:43,007
The structure that they're running the networks have no idea

1593
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:48,639
What devices are connected to the network and it's pretty interesting when you start to have technology

1594
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:53,247
But then looks at the types of devices that are connecting people surprise

1595
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,783
It's just even in the audit

1596
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,599
Of what they even have a wireless perspective

1597
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:00,415
Even companies that don't think they have much find out

1598
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,487
That people run spy cameras that there are

1599
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:06,047
Drones in the vicinity that hook up to their Network

1600
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,351
We had CEOs that have found that

1601
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,375
You know when they're

1602
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:13,983
Automatically hooking up to their you know they think they're hooking up to a Cellular Tower

1603
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:14,751
From there

1604
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:15,519
Cell phone

1605
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,591
Someone can actually replicate that cell tower

1606
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,407
In a device in a car parked out Sun

1607
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,199
Update seniors home

1608
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:26,783
And now you're going to start to put data directly where you don't think you're putting it

1609
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,087
The whole idea round Wireless

1610
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,135
Cybersaint

1611
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:35,487
All these different devices that are connecting it's just fascinating

1612
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,511
And something that

1613
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,535
To be done

1614
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,863
A lot of the companies

1615
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,167
Putting Warren Moore

1616
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,983
Wirelessly connected devices into the universe

1617
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:53,407
Will probably making our last investment in someone

1618
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,687
In a wireless fabric

1619
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,223
Good company for this day

1620
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:59,295
Got it and you guys are raising fun too

1621
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,367
And that is where we're going to see more of your AI

1622
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,391
And analytics Focus

1623
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,415
Christian vestments correct

1624
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,439
Exactly

1625
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:08,255
In the new year will be finishing up the last

1626
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,535
Investment fund 1

1627
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,583
And will be launching the second

1628
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,375
The same strategy

1629
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:19,775
Sandusky industrial side of the it will be working with a number of corporate groups that are currently investor

1630
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,823
Continue on with us

1631
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:25,151
Our sun is largely made up by a dollar amount

1632
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,199
Institutional Financial investors

1633
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:30,015
We're looking for strong returns but we do have

1634
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:36,415
Select group of very strategic limited partners

1635
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,439
Cisco Systems

1636
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,463
Caterpillar

1637
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,535
And electricity de France which is the world's largest

1638
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
Power utility

1639
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,839
As we go into Fun

1640
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,631
2 will decrease the size

1641
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,655
Spike Lee

1642
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:50,751
Up from 70 million and fun one to a hundred million and fun too

1643
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,567
The focus will again start to

1644
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,127
Shift a little bit as we see the IP of all things

1645
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:59,199
I'm going to start to move into a little bit more of that

1646
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,223
Blaine Anderson

1647
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,271
We've been talking about where we have

1648
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:05,343
Few more companies on the analytics side

1649
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,135
We have been mapping a host

1650
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:11,999
Cyber security companies that we also think are going to be urgently needed us

1651
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,791
People develop a variety

1652
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,327
She strategy and then

1653
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,863
They start to realize they have

1654
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:22,495
Have cyber resiliency baked in so that they make sure they're doing it safely and that they don't have embarrassing moments

1655
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,799
What about things like Edge Computing this

1656
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
Does people talk

1657
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,591
So much about

1658
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:30,943
Does that fit in with your current pieces or is that kind of a side project

1659
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,967
Are you guys just aren't Focus

1660
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:36,319
Stacy I mean clearly Cisco's very interested in

1661
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,855
Anyone that makes a box

1662
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,647
It's it's remotely somewhere

1663
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,975
Wants to put computer power on and have it make decisions in

1664
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,743
Crate

1665
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:47,839
Increase Value Guide for it and I think there are applications that make total sense

1666
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,119
Right where you don't want it

1667
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:49,887
Descending

1668
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,423
Tons and tons of data

1669
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,471
Into the cloud when

1670
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,007
There's not a lot of changes on

1671
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,799
You know and so

1672
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,591
You need the data but it doesn't itch

1673
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:01,151
Is pretty static data now when it does change it

1674
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,175
Usually catastrophic

1675
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:02,943
Second Sole

1676
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,247
You want to know about that so I think there are a lot of

1677
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,063
Locations where you can have Edge compute

1678
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:14,463
And devices will kind of do their own software analysis on the edge and if there is that where except

1679
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,487
Russian. Ghost

1680
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,511
The cloud or starts

1681
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,047
To be alerted to people

1682
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:21,375
Independently but yeah I know

1683
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,167
I just think that use cases are very

1684
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,959
Pacific Ranch Computing make sense

1685
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,495
Got it all right

1686
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,543
Will Scott thank you so much

1687
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,383
For coming on the show today I feel much smarter already and very excited

1688
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,407
About 2019

1689
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,967
Hey Stacy I really appreciate it

1690
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,015
That's it for this week

1691
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,551
Thanks so much for listening

1692
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,111
And remember if you'd like more iot news

1693
