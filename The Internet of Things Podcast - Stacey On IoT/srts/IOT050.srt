00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,984
Everybody

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,288
Welcome to the Internet of Things podcast

3
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:21,504
And this week we have a great show for you

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,064
Ring raising a lot of money

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,856
New lights from Philips Hue

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,952
Are we go to SAC lights and Miracle grows bread

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,744
Internet of yard

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,072
Internet of plants that sounds way better

10
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,888
And I guess this week

11
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,704
Senior vice president of digital payments

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,080
At Labs at MasterCard and we're going to talk about putting payment capabilities into clothing

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,104
Rings

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,896
And even golf clubs

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
So stay tuned

16
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
All right

17
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,016
Let's talk about

18
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,552
What happened with ness this week

19
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,904
Last week we talked about the brand new features which we were

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,672
Solid

21
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:02,976
We are happy

22
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,280
Turns out

23
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,096
When does introduces new features

24
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:14,496
Use your smartphone's location to help calibrate your nest so it knew if you are away from your home or not and the other was actually

25
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,568
So you could share your nest app with other people

26
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,360
The password

27
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,432
When they launched those features

28
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,808
Nest also had to change and update their terms of service and privacy policies to

29
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,368
Because they're collecting new information and sharing it with me

30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
New people

31
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,952
So when they did that though

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
They basically put

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
A note in the app

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
Would you open your app

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
But other people open their apps

36
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,376
Who discovered that they had

37
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
Two choices

38
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Conditions

39
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
They could not

40
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,640
Well the second option is they can get more info about the terms of service changes

41
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,688
But there's no I don't accept

42
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:05,440
So I actually just installed the nest app on a brand new phone because I've been using the Wing Cap on it

43
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,512
How to get exactly what

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
What I would say is relatively big issue in that if folks don't want the new family accounts and Houma

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Assist

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,776
Well it's too bad you don't get to use your nest at all

47
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
If you don't want to

48
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,848
If you don't want these features

49
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
Or

50
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,688
Rather you don't have the option to say hey I'd rather

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,992
Grandfathered under the old privacy

52
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,296
And not use those features

53
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
Emissions

54
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,976
There's an option that's missing

55
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
So

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
This brings up kind of

57
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:46,400
Twitter a couple people like me and you're holding my Nest hostage

58
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,704
And I actually thought back to

59
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,008
Phillips when they implemented error

60
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
Android update

61
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,080
Android 400 update

62
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
For the shoe

63
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,712
Messed up a little bit in their implementation

64
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,040
Emissions

65
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,136
It's so basically we agree to like share

66
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,696
They're photostream and share

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,256
Location

68
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,352
And also just access to media and files on the device

69
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
That's it

70
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
They didn't agree to that

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
Just close

72
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
Music

73
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,848
It wasn't even you could accept to other three

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,432
Keep using your ass

75
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
Add accepted

76
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,320
Update on March 3rd

77
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,880
So now they're doing the permissions

78
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
Correctly

79
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,232
Pick and choose what you want to share and now you

80
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
Use the app

81
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
It's a little different though

82
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:55,008
The issue is in this points to an issue that Kevin and I were talking about before the show which is

83
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
My gosh we have these physical devices

84
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,432
And we have a rubric for an upgrade permissions on software

85
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,784
Physical devices installed in your

86
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,856
Your home like on your wall or in your light sockets

87
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
You know how

88
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
Much of an option to take it orally

89
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
But short of

90
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:19,839
Ripping out a piece of hardware and replacing it with something that's comfortable Better or Worse whatever you decide

91
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,631
And that's obviously not ideal

92
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
Exactly so

93
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,215
What was the mistake one is

94
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:31,615
Intentional but it's not intentional and some like we're going to start sucking all of your data out kind of way but

95
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,407
I guess there's nothing to say that

96
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,943
They couldn't do that

97
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,503
I mean I don't know what Nest is going to do here

98
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
If anything's

99
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
But

100
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,855
If I were them what I would do is

101
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:47,743
Keep the old terms of service for any and also Implement app permissions to use these features

102
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,583
And if people say no I don't want to use these features meeting you know

103
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,143
Permissions I want to get permission on my location Etc

104
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,495
Then just let them stay in the old terms of service because they're using

105
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
Nest as it was

106
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
Under that terms of service

107
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,919
And therefore if you accept the app permissions to use the new features

108
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,247
Then you have to buy default agree to the new terms of service

109
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
For the future

110
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,855
There's nothing on the software side in terms of the permissions the app permissions

111
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
Mitigate this right now

112
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:20,255
And I should say in most of these companies would say this

113
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,399
Most connected Hardware companies build their devices so they will still work even if the app is gone or

114
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,215
So your nest thermostat was still

115
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,799
You can still control it for the wall we're just talking about

116
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
Recommend

117
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,639
Replacing the Philips Hue Lights even if you didn't have it on the app

118
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
I can still turn it on and off

119
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Light switch

120
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
And and I should mention

121
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,087
And I said I did not have the nest app installed on this new phone I do have the Wink app

122
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,903
And that still work perfectly fine

123
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
With

124
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
The nest

125
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,023
I want to use my phone to control the temperature for an apple

126
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
So I guess you couldn't

127
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
There there's a workaround if you don't want to accept a new privacy

128
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
Terms and conditions

129
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
Possibly

130
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727
By going through another

131
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
Github another app

132
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
That feels like

133
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
Yeah

134
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,295
Very possible it's very possible I don't know how long that may or may not last I haven't tried with you Amazon Echo to see if I can still

135
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
Do things as well so

136
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,415
Really nice nice nice to own and fix this issue addressed this issue

137
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,791
And I think it's probably relevant for everyone in this industry to start thinking about

138
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,863
People feel a sense of ownership

139
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:33,983
These devices

140
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,799
Physically attached to their homes for example yeah

141
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,359
Figuring out a way to gracefully

142
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,663
It's not even graceful degradation

143
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
Implementation of

144
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,551
New features and possibly new privacy

145
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,367
Right conditions is going to be essential

146
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:57,023
Imagine imagine what I'm at the home but think of all the other connected devices imagine if your car

147
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,607
New terms of service because of something maybe new GPS function

148
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,399
And you didn't want to use this function

149
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,751
Well you could either use the function and agree to the new terms of service for your car just stops

150
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
Your car doesn't work

151
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
I mean essentially the same thing

152
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,895
Soda Springs to mind an issue that happened last year

153
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,431
John Deere

154
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
And actually General Motors and they

155
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,551
We're basically saying they used copyright law

156
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
To argue that

157
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,439
Company are people who bought their devices couldn't modify them

158
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,791
In ways that basically they argued that modifying their vehicles

159
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
Wood

160
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Break copyright law

161
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,167
Chrysler software that runs inside the pickles

162
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Change your tires

163
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,079
You're not allowed to get a flat tire and go buy a new John Deere

164
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,919
And people were very upset they said this is like the opposite of ownership

165
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,527
People no longer on their vehicles in the copyright office back in November

166
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Timeout

167
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
And said that actually

168
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:59,487
Actually you can modify your vehicle but it's only under certain really Limited

169
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
Conditions

170
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,095
So you can't violate you know Department of Transportation

171
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
Any payroll so

172
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,823
This is so funny that this is coming up now because just over the weekend and is not the first time I've done this is the second time I've done this

173
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,127
But just over the weekend I bought a

174
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,967
Box that I can make it to the engine of my 2016 Golf R W

175
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,503
Apr Golf R

176
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:26,111
And basically Alters how the engine works because it

177
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,695
Sends different signals to the ECU or engine control unit

178
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:34,815
So I'm getting like an extra 45 horsepower an extra couple PSI of boost on the turbo and

179
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
I mean I'm having fun with it

180
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,655
6 Pawnee Dr. Funner to drive

181
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
That makes sense

182
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,239
If I break any laws speeding that's you know

183
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,799
Where are the parks in there or not that's on me

184
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:49,919
But you know how violated any copyright laws now because I don't own the software

185
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,967
In the engine control unit

186
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,319
Now that's a VW Thing even though I own the car what do we own

187
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,879
This is really a good question

188
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,975
Yes so it especially as more features are enabled by software

189
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
So

190
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
That

191
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,911
We've come so far

192
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Both

193
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
Like we said

194
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:18,591
The companies building these devices are going to have to think about this but then we might also have some

195
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
Some lawsuits to look forward to

196
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
Okay so

197
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:27,039
I probably shouldn't mention this on their then because he probably will have lawsuits

198
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
I didn't change my car honest

199
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
Alright Kevin is

200
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,463
On the straight and narrow

201
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,839
Hey you know it's my car if and

202
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:45,983
I want to change something where the ECU or the radio that's on me I think

203
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Can

204
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,591
Yes I'm held accountable for that if I do something illegal with the vehicle

205
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
Whether or not I modified it

206
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,199
And yes VW can say I'm out of warranty

207
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,015
But that's a choice that I choose to make

208
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,319
Here with mass going back to the very original thing

209
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
Right now I was saying people don't have a choice

210
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,255
So after spending $250 on a nest thermostat

211
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
It might be pretty much

212
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,887
Speaking of spending money on connected devices

213
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,215
We have got a whole new option for people

214
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
SQ his

215
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
Announce

216
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
New

217
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
White

218
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,455
But that doesn't really sound exciting on the surface but it is

219
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Because

220
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:32,319
These are the Philips Hue White Ambiance lights

221
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,111
Basically as I see it

222
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,415
These are tunable white lights

223
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,487
Switch I actually prefer my house because I like to go from

224
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:46,143
Different color temperatures from soft white to warm way to Daylight and so on Depending on time of day and

225
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,239
And these will do that up from the 2200

226
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,543
Hey toots 6500 case you get

227
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,103
Hallway down to like warm yellow all x-ray

228
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Daylight

229
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,455
With these tunable bulbs I do not know the cost of these yet by the way

230
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,807
What's also interesting knows they're smart enough to adjust

231
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,391
The shade of color temperature throughout the day if you would like

232
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:12,255
Similar to and CC I don't know if you use any apps like this with similar to something called

233
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
Flux on a Mac

234
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
Or G Luxe and Chrome

235
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,911
Basically these are software bits that

236
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,519
Remove the bluish white light from your screen silver with a reddish light

237
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,079
And the reason being there been studies saying if your

238
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,127
Looking at blue white screens

239
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,295
It becomes harder to sleep you could lose up to an hour of sleep because it stimulates the rods and cones in your eyes and so forth

240
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,367
So that's kind of the object are these Ambiance lights

241
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
It's

242
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,183
Progressively changing

243
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,535
White color based on time of day activity and someone you can do that smartly or you can

244
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Programming

245
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Okay and

246
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,887
If you don't want these

247
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
They still make the Hue Lux Witcher 2

248
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
Dimmable

249
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
White lights

250
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Yes and

251
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
I'm looking for the price

252
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
To see if there is a price here

253
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,919
I couldn't find one

254
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,551
They were just announced that I'd say a day ago so information still trickling out

255
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
And I looked at those

256
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
Hue Lux bulbs

257
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
Dimmable but

258
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,231
I really like tunable that's just a personal preference in the

259
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:19,583
They didn't have one up until then so I've been using the Crees and has worms

260
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,935
And now there is actually just for people who are is obsessed with lighting as I am

261
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,519
Is the C by GE that also came out so

262
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,591
You came out this spring as well and you can order them

263
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,663
These are there going to be the homekit lights

264
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,759
And they sleep and see life

265
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
So one is designed

266
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
Are there different bulbs in

267
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,695
For your bedroom you're supposed to use the Seas sleep lights

268
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,767
They're supposed to dim all the way down kind of at night

269
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,607
Using the Circadian rhythm from like the super bright blue

270
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,167
Daylight to EE warm yellow light

271
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
I guess that's where the Sea comes from

272
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,799
Oh you like the letter c

273
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Yeah yeah

274
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,151
C is for cookie that's good enough for me

275
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,015
Today Show is brought to you by the letter c

276
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
And the number for just because

277
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
I'm sorry

278
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
That is okay

279
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,463
Okay

280
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
Too late

281
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,303
I can't I can't talk about these jokes right now

282
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,143
So the starter pack is $50 in

283
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
That includes

284
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
And I believe a hug

285
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
Two of each

286
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,151
Deal

287
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
Regular price is set

288
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
$70

289
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
If you want these

290
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
Weather now

291
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,343
Because it is a good deal that's a good deal for

292
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
Circadian rhythm

293
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,951
I might do this although I don't think they work with my wink

294
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
I don't know

295
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,095
See if they work with wink because

296
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
They're going to be homekit compatible

297
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
And

298
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,799
Android is coming soon they don't you can't even spell the app

299
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
Going to happen

300
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
So

301
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
That's okay

302
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
For other gadgets that you may want

303
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,879
We got some exciting news for you

304
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,975
Oh wait to see by GE bulbs are connected via Bluetooth

305
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Cheetah mobile app

306
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
So it's phone control

307
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
Could using stairs an Android app

308
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
So

309
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,359
Knowing that we got to two options in the lighting category for you there

310
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
I am testing a

311
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
And these guys

312
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,135
Are really cool I've been really excited about them and I've been living them for like a week and a half

313
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,951
I'm part of that time I was out of town so

314
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
My review is a little

315
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,047
You're going to hear more about them as I live more with him

316
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
Because they also learned

317
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,863
So these lights

318
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
The cool thing about them is

319
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,239
They want to be responsive as opposed to program

320
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,567
So they have motion sensors and ambient light sensors

321
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
And

322
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,663
The awesome part about them

323
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Is

324
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
They are very responsive

325
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
Unlike with my

326
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,343
When I was testing the connected home plugs

327
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,159
You would walk into the room and it would be like

328
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,255
I'll let you walk halfway into the room sometimes and the lightstone wouldn't go on

329
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,679
But here the second you walk under them food the lights turned on

330
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,263
And I found in the bedroom this is amazing

331
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
So I installed

332
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
Lights in the bedroom

333
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
My bedroom and

334
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,455
A little Abner caught the potty room I don't know what the graceful way of

335
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
It's like a bathroom

336
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,343
Just a room with the toilet in her master bathroom

337
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,903
So I installed one in there and I installed one

338
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,207
Or I stopped several in the hallway

339
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
Right outside

340
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
In our bedroom

341
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
So

342
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Nice

343
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,095
Use cases are

344
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,935
They automatically have a circadian rhythm setting

345
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,703
So

346
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,775
When I walk in in the middle of the day there

347
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,359
Wherever they are in their circadian rhythm setting and getting that kind of light

348
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,431
They have a wake-up alarm function so it can

349
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
But gradually brighten the room

350
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,039
Had to think of what all that they had a lot of really cool things

351
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,855
What I've discovered though

352
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Is

353
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,695
Living with motion sensors

354
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
Is a little bit hard

355
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,327
It works really well in

356
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,863
Like the tiny little bathroom

357
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,215
It doesn't work as well in the hallway because when

358
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
We get near the hallway

359
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
The lights

360
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
Turn on like even at night

361
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:53,759
Editor nighttime mode is kind of nice they have a sleep mode where you can put the lights into your belly to be off or you can

362
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,063
Make them glow it like 5%

363
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
Series have, second ambient light

364
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Yes

365
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,743
But in the middle of the night when you trigger the hallway light

366
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
You're like

367
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
It's still comprise

368
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
Send it times out

369
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,423
So I have mine set out to timeout at like 1 minute because

370
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
That's a lot of light

371
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
And so

372
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,055
I guess there's a lot there's a learning curve to using

373
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
But

374
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,639
Did the closest I have so far to Magic

375
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,943
And I'm pretty sure that was some software tweaks

376
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Is there going to be

377
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
Almost as intuitive as they want

378
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
Interesting

379
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:34,719
And as I'm looking at the at the bulbs on the stack lighting.com site looks like a hub

380
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,767
Which uses a sick day for

381
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
Mesh networking all the lights together

382
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
We shouldn't have its own hug but

383
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
They look pretty smart

384
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,519
Super LaRon so to speak Endo programming requires you to

385
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
Yes I do I mean like

386
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,687
Again there's some things I wish like I wish I could put the whole house to sleep all at once when I hit

387
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,735
But instead you have to go room by room

388
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,807
Which is kind of like

389
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,391
Like when I lock down for the night boom I want it all back down

390
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,415
So they don't have

391
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,975
There is an apple right

392
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
But it doesn't have like an all off for

393
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Yes

394
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,119
It does not have it does not have that everything's controlled by the

395
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
Legacy like as it gets

396
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,543
But if I had these throughout my house like I wouldn't want to put the whole house to sleep maybe if my daughter

397
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
Up in her room

398
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,383
Yeah where somebody wakes up in the middle of the night

399
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,967
It's sensitive but I'm in all off mode can't turn on now

400
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
I mean there are still things but

401
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
It is

402
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,647
The most intuitive so far and the

403
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,463
The promises that these will learn your

404
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Kind of habits

405
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,583
I haven't you I feel like I haven't used them long enough to really learn

406
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631
The captain start understanding

407
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
Like what I'm doing things

408
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
But I'm eager to see what that

409
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
Now

410
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,311
These are $60 a bulb

411
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,359
I do see what the starter pack is

412
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,711
Believe it's 150 because it includes the Hub into

413
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,759
2 Bulbs Plus The Hub

414
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Okay

415
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
Yeah these are not cheap

416
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Discern

417
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:09,439
BR30

418
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
You know I like

419
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,279
Standard bulbs which they say are coming soon

420
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,095
They are at CES and

421
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,167
The cool thing about those is how do you get a motion sensor

422
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
Work through a lamp

423
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,287
How do you get an ambient light

424
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,103
And I should say the ambient light sensor is awesome

425
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,407
Because it does it pulls

426
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,735
Some of my lights don't turn on would like the the windows are open

427
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
And I walk into my bedroom

428
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,647
Only like one of the lights that is kind of further away from

429
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
All the light for me

430
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
Windows

431
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
So it's kind of cool you like

432
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,607
It's my turn on the light that when you already have light in that room that area

433
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
So

434
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Interesting

435
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,447
I'm liking these lights

436
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,775
I feel like I should also say they integrate with nest

437
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,823
Southern motion sensor can talk to nest

438
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,615
And be like hey someone still in the house

439
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
Don't turn off the air conditioning

440
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,479
And then they also integrate with if this then that

441
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
So I

442
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,551
Trigger them via the Amazon Echo

443
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
So

444
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,855
All that works seamlessly

445
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,647
And issue

446
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
Has potential I like it

447
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
It does

448
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
It's got to be good

449
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,047
So

450
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,095
If you're a lighting freak

451
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,887
Like myself

452
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,983
I would say go and buy some and start playing with him you're going to need probably a lot

453
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
I would just kind of an investment

454
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
If you want to wait

455
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
Like another couple

456
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,663
Of weeks or a month or so I bet I could tell you like

457
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
Yes they are significantly better

458
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
Stay tuned

459
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
We have money

460
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,439
Ring

461
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,487
But connected doorbell maker

462
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:53,119
Has raised 61 million dollars is a serious around so that's a third round of funding for them

463
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,679
And a racer from Kleiner Perkins

464
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
And they also

465
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,031
Launched a brand new girl

466
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,615
And this one is a slightly higher and doorbell it's

467
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,431
Instead of costing $200 this one cost 250

468
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,735
This is the ring video doorbell Pro

469
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
It has

470
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,391
PhD as opposed to 7:20 so little higher hi-def

471
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,256
And it also is all wired so it has a Slimmer profile

472
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
In the old ring

473
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,144
$200 rate original

474
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,472
Serena used to be known as doorbot

475
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:33,824
That was not a great product

476
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
Currently waste a lot of money

477
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,408
Prior to the Stingrays.

478
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
20

479
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:43,552
I want to say it was $28 round LED by Richard Branson

480
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
The point is

481
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,648
New doorbell

482
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
I'm kind of excited about it cuz

483
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
Cuz I love my video doorbell

484
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,048
Yeah it's not as quite as wide as the old one

485
00:21:54,816 --> 00:22:00,960
You know because the old one would not sit on my door

486
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,752
Because it doesn't have batteries

487
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
So you have to wire it in

488
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,872
You take out the battery and then they also use

489
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:14,272
Components for mobile phones that supposed to I guess traditional Electronics components so the whole profile is much slimmer

490
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,368
I can't wait to see it because maybe I can fit it in my door

491
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:23,232
Maybe I was going to try to get you out and they also have interchangeable faceplates

492
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
People who care about the color of

493
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
Which actually is me

494
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,608
You could change it every day of the week very cool

495
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
So that is

496
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,984
I don't know I think it's I think it's

497
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,176
Samantha rings

498
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
Good on them

499
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
And

500
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,760
Connected yard

501
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,624
Which is not something I ever thought we'd be talking about all that much but

502
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,488
I don't have any art that people really really really care about

503
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,792
We get a lot of actually inbound requests

504
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,072
How to test sprinkler

505
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,632
I'm still working out house

506
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,168
We're supposed to do that so

507
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,520
Stay tuned because I do want to get some of those on the show and be like hey this is better than that one

508
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
But

509
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
Miracle-Gro

510
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,432
Scott's Scotts Miracle-Gro they have a

511
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,320
Baby introduced a platform called the connectedyard platform I think it's called grow dro

512
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,368
It's a platform

513
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,928
Basically allow lots of different

514
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:31,328
I'll sit mostly Smart Water type controller such as those from Blossom rachio green IQ

515
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,632
Center to parrot

516
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
Quaintly

517
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,704
So it's basically platform to get all these

518
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,752
Sensors and devices talking to each other

519
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,336
Which is Enter Sandman because all these things would be tied together soil

520
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:46,432
Moisture for example would be interesting to a sprinkler for example so

521
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,224
Connecting

522
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
Peace

523
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
Makes sense to me

524
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,600
Make sense at Scotts Miracle-Gro add B12 company seducao

525
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,392
Do we have any

526
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,952
Other information I don't know when

527
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,256
IPhones actually launching or has it

528
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,816
Yeah this is this launched

529
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
Well this lunch

530
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,376
The news of the popcorn line

531
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
In

532
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Last week

533
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,032
I think of it like a health kit for

534
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:17,152
Yards just going to go in and tie in with weather data so basically

535
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Hey

536
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
Water main yard

537
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,272
It's also kind of promising because

538
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,344
If this will actuate and it sounds like it will

539
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
It will

540
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
Be able to

541
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,744
Set some of these things off because it's rachio for examples

542
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,048
Control controls your irrigation so

543
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
Oil sensor says

544
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
Heart

545
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
It could be like

546
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,448
Oh I will turn on the butter

547
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,752
And because it integrates local weather data

548
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,544
It may also be like

549
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,128
If you can hold out for just a little longer it's going to rain

550
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:54,016
I was just really promising for trout areas drought-stricken areas and also takes idea just a

551
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,344
Iot stop providing information and starts making it

552
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
Again letting it

553
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
Idevices app

554
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,464
Even do so without

555
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,072
Amscot says long-haired lawn care services to

556
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,912
People will come out and so on

557
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
Your lawn and

558
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:17,568
Delta recommend certain fertilizers and certain cycles of fertilization and so on

559
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,360
So in a sense it could even help

560
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
Company itself

561
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
In terms of that

562
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,528
But instead of just having one person come out one time and evaluate your lawn

563
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,088
This is like a constant evaluation which kind of need

564
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,392
Data and

565
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,464
I'm going to guess that they're going to let you know the

566
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
Rapper X

567
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
Stop light

568
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
Proper squats

569
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
You know

570
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,608
Fertilizer indoor plant food

571
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:45,984
IT shop if they didn't I didn't

572
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,544
This is possibly a service Revenue play

573
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,152
Sending our technicians out to you but it could also be a really useful way to gather data

574
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,712
To help sell more of their product switches

575
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
I want to see a really

576
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,808
Good way for a big company to be like

577
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,856
Hey here's how an open platform

578
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
So

579
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
Yay

580
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
Very cool

581
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
Super Bowl

582
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
All right

583
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,328
And I was at South by Southwest

584
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,912
And I spent a lot of time talking to

585
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:19,008
Companies and I'm just trying to think about the coolest things I saw

586
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,080
When I give you one in the rest I'll have to think about

587
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,920
Tell me about next show that I did see a company called Bernoulli

588
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,480
And if you are interested in cocktails

589
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
Like myself

590
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,808
This is really a neat idea

591
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,600
This is going to be launched

592
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,648
Is lunch now

593
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,208
What is RR

594
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
Blue toothpaste

595
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,328
Bottle stoppers for your bar so your

596
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,352
Your alcohol collection

597
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,936
Eight of them for $300

598
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,728
I know it's kind of

599
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,152
You go to the app and you're like

600
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,944
I have the follow

601
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,760
Things in my bar

602
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,296
Are the drinks you can make with that

603
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
I would like to meet this one

604
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
And then you

605
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,136
Pour the drink

606
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
When you're pouring the alcohol in

607
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,488
It's going to actually stop

608
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
The flow of liquid

609
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
Reaches the Impala

610
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,840
Clever

611
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
I saw it and it works

612
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,424
I was actually that was like the most

613
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
Magical

614
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,008
So the top

615
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
Lights up

616
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,568
It's like oh this is the gym

617
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
All right

618
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,368
But I get your address

619
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,416
And they won't catch me

620
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:44,256
Go ahead kids make the drink for Daddy

621
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
Chinese martini

622
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,656
Cuz I played with a lot of robotic bartending

623
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,032
Because you got a stick

624
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,616
Professional use

625
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,480
Similar idea only

626
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,320
That sucks up all the moisture and then you got to clean all those tubes

627
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
I don't know when you're dealing with like

628
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
Alcohol

629
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,232
Mixers were talking about you no stickiness

630
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,768
So I was like

631
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
That seems like a lot of work

632
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,424
A lot of money this is actually relatively speaking much cheaper and

633
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,240
It really doesn't change how you

634
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,312
Make a drink today in essentially other than

635
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,384
Doing the measuring and the recipe for you so it's not like there's

636
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
A convoluted hurdler involve

637
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,992
There's there's just about

638
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
No hubs good

639
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
They're not wifi-connected bottle.

640
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
What's good

641
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,416
Russia how are they connect

642
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,304
Got it makes sense make sense

643
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
Spider Lily

644
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632
Go to my Christmas list

645
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
Dude there you go

646
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,984
Presumably that's what they say

647
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
Keep an eye on

648
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
All right

649
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:07,200
We will move on to our guests who is Sherry Hammond who is an SVP of digital payments

650
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
Closet MasterCard

651
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:15,136
And we're going to talk about the future of how you will pay you for things

652
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:26,912
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

653
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,216
Am I guess today is Sherry haymond

654
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:33,056
She's an SVP of digital payments and Labs at MasterCard

655
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,104
Hi Sherry thanks for joining us today

656
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,152
Hi Stacy thanks so much for having me

657
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,712
I am super excited about this because I

658
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
Hate

659
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,040
Grabbing my wallet out and you guys have

660
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
You have this new

661
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,368
Call the thing

662
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
Coming for lack of a better word

663
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
With the Arnold

664
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,232
Palmer Invitational golf tournament

665
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,792
And you guys have put

666
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:58,144
You've worked with a partner to embed payment technology into a golf glove

667
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,936
Which I think is kind of fun

668
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:00,960
You can

669
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,032
Wave your hand to pay for Refreshments on the golf course

670
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
Can you do other things with it

671
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:10,432
I think that's probably the you know that the most prominent

672
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,968
Case for this

673
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,552
So with the gospel is actually a proof-of-concept

674
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:20,672
I'm it's something that were able to enable through a broader program that we have called

675
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,208
Commerce for every device

676
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,512
So what that program allows us

677
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
What to do is

678
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,584
In a really simple easy

679
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Picture away

680
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,424
Is it possible for

681
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,776
All kinds of different devices wearables jewelry clothing

682
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,824
The manufacturers of those

683
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,104
You know item

684
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,408
To connect with our platform

685
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
And Hobbes

686
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,736
The consumer that using that device

687
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,808
Or Gadget or clothing or wearable

688
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
Ask

689
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,624
To have their payment credentials

690
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,160
Gander MasterCard pay

691
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
Credentials

692
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
Securely put on to that device

693
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,536
And made available for that device

694
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,072
To use and so

695
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,144
Although you know not in production and we did do that

696
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,704
Special

697
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:08,800
Bespoke for the Arnold Palmer

698
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,824
Invitational

699
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,896
It is an example of what can be done with our cut

700
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,920
Sandusky

701
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,200
Callaway Golf Clubs

702
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,504
And there's a payment chip

703
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
In the club

704
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,576
That connects via Bluetooth

705
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,112
On a phone

706
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
And you can

707
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
Scan your card credentials

708
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,256
Charlie into the phone

709
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,792
You know at which point

710
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
The app basically makes

711
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,864
MasterCard

712
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:37,216
We assure know that you want to put your credential on for the device

713
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,264
Stuart a methodology we have

714
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,568
We make sure with the issuer that you are you

715
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,152
And then we make that payment credential available

716
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,992
In a tokenize way so we don't make the real credential available

717
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,040
But instead a surrogate

718
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808
Credential

719
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,088
Together with

720
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,880
Secure cryptographic keys

721
00:31:55,392 --> 00:32:01,024
That make sure that each transaction is safe and secure and unique that uses the same technology as EMV chip card

722
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
Okay

723
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,328
So that was that was like

724
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
Everything I need to know

725
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,680
So this is a prototype

726
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,448
Close

727
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
Can people actually use it

728
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,336
Well the people at the API and will be able to use it but I mean

729
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,128
Don't currently have plans

730
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
Available commercially

731
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:21,760
But we'll see when you know what gauge the interest on its Callaway or any other

732
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,296
Glove manufacturer

733
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
Would like to

734
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
You know it's definitely

735
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:30,720
Possible as an example of why it's possible

736
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,744
Partnerships with

737
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
Many other

738
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,096
Clothing jewelry device manufacturers and

739
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,424
Closest to this actually is a designer named Adam Selman

740
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
I'm here

741
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
Is probably most famous for designing

742
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,544
Dresses for Rihanna he does all the cost

743
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,824
Inspire her tours

744
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,152
You're beautiful clothes available

745
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
I'm at high end stores today

746
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,272
Operation with Nordstrom

747
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,552
We worked with him

748
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,904
To again make some prototypes but later this year we will be working with him

749
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,952
How to make those commercially available

750
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
I'm in the prototypes

751
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,536
He created included address

752
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,096
Sunglasses a handbag on

753
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,168
I'm so they weren't golf clubs they were

754
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
Fashion

755
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
Winter gloves

756
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,288
That is in the winter you are

757
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,336
Going out in the morning you know you can

758
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,616
Citrulline

759
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,408
Payment credential.

760
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,712
So that example if you're in London UK

761
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:28,320
I can wave your hands over the turnstile at the CFL magically entering

762
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,136
Be on your way with your eyes

763
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
That magical in

764
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:39,328
And you guys have agreement not just with some of these by Ashley this is not allergic

765
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:43,424
Company but you have an agreement with one of our favorite devices which is brainly

766
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,824
Cocktail ring that I currently wear it whenever I'm dressed up and I want to get notifications on my phone or from my

767
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
Looking at my phone

768
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,408
And soon I'll be able to use it

769
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,688
Pay for things with my

770
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:00,320
That's exactly right so we've been working with ringly

771
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,344
Such a great company

772
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,440
And you were very lucky to in the fall when we announced

773
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,256
Star Commerce for every device program

774
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
The name of this program that were

775
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
Using two

776
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:16,192
Easily connect with the device manufacturers and enable payments on the devices

777
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,240
When we was actually one of our launch partner

778
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,032
So we worked with Chris

779
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,592
Go bring Lisa and her team

780
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,872
To actually put

781
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:28,736
Picture painted credentials on to wait that we had at the show and they actually work

782
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,808
And so for me I mean I'm a working mom

783
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,648
Simplification of my day today that I

784
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,256
Do you know I connect my ring any in the morning anyway to my phone

785
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
In the fall or

786
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,816
Later this year

787
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,608
Later this year

788
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,936
Will be able to I will also be able to

789
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
The Charlie

790
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
I'm transfer via

791
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,312
Bluetooth encrypted Bluetooth technology

792
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,336
I'll be able to

793
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,432
Shirley transfer cards you know accounts by provisioned through an app on my phone

794
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,968
To my ring lyrics

795
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,504
And then when I'm

796
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,064
You know off on my day I'll be able to

797
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,112
You again later this year

798
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:12,000
At my ring at Starbucks when I'm getting my coffee I'll be able to tap my ring on a New York City

799
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
Cab near when I'm

800
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:19,936
Running between meeting for example

801
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,704
Functional

802
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
Beautiful

803
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:26,080
We're working with ringlets a great example of how we're adding payment functionality to something

804
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,104
Is already

805
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
Very useful to the

806
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,456
Until all it needs is to have an NF

807
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,504
NFC and Bluetooth chip in it

808
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
Route to work

809
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,136
Pretty much I mean the underlying technology is

810
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:42,720
A check that's enabled with NFC and then also

811
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
Bluetooth

812
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,280
However the

813
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
There's obviously

814
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,328
An integration that happened

815
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
Between

816
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:52,448
Either the device manufacturer or an enabler that they're working with

817
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,032
And we're working with Darius and ambler's including nxp

818
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
Qualcomm

819
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,616
And coin there's several others that have not been announced yet

820
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,920
We're going to be integrating with our

821
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
System

822
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
So that

823
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,248
The device manufacturer doesn't nest

824
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
Integrate directly with us

825
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
Got it

826
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
Now

827
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:15,232
So let's let's take this back as couple steps in as like a normal person who's going about their day

828
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,768
Ordering a coffee

829
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,328
What is the process look like I wave it

830
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,376
I always my hand can I buy like

831
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,448
I don't know a stereo with this or how does

832
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,008
What are the limits to my my new-found

833
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,872
In fact this is actually all of this

834
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,432
Technology is actually available in Market

835
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Today

836
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,784
You know so for many years we've had available

837
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,600
Not only in the United States but globally

838
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,416
What's called MasterCard contactless technology

839
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,464
It's built on NFC

840
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
Technology

841
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,536
Actually is underpinned by the same

842
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,584
Technology

843
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,888
You know it's available at more than

844
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,680
4 million payment terminals

845
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
Globally

846
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
So

847
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,568
Each country has its own specific limit

848
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
How much you can

849
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
What the

850
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,176
Amount of the transaction

851
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Complete

852
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,528
Using contactless functionality without having a

853
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,320
An additional cardholder

854
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,136
So here's what I mean in the United States

855
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,440
Does a $50 contactless limit

856
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,976
That means that up to

857
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
$50

858
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,768
You can do it

859
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
Without having

860
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:27,168
To do an additional thing like provide a signature

861
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,448
After the fact

862
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,728
On credit

863
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
Until

864
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,312
You if you wanted to actually buy

865
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,104
A stereo or a TV

866
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
Best Buy

867
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,664
Obviously that's going

868
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,200
Over $50

869
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,224
In that case

870
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,016
You would tap your ring

871
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,576
And then it was at the merchant

872
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
Terminal

873
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,184
Thank you for a signature after the fact I do this actually every week with

874
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,256
Either Apple pay or Samsung pay I use both

875
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
I'm at

876
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,328
Every weekend

877
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,936
There you go so let's think about this because I'm very curious about

878
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:04,544
The world of the future of payments because right now I can pay with my phone

879
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,568
So

880
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,152
Allen tablet down I got my ring Wrigley now

881
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:14,528
Baby I got some crazy handbag

882
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
So

883
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,088
I guess is it

884
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:21,440
Oversaturation or how do you view liked the the user going through their day

885
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,024
In choosing these things thinking about how to

886
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,840
Make their payments does it just become like whatever I

887
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
It's convenient

888
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
Exactly

889
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:36,032
So thank you you hit the nail on the head so we don't think that there's going to be

890
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,568
A winner here

891
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:41,408
You know people have individual taste then we're in a world where

892
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,040
Customization and personalization and they want to be able to

893
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
Do things like pee

894
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:54,208
With whatever is most accessible or convenient or attractive to them just like you know you pick your

895
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
Clothes everyday and you

896
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
Pickyourshoes

897
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,328
Millions and millions of choices for those things

898
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,656
There will probably be many many choices for

899
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
What object

900
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,472
You enable

901
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,776
Car payment and I think different

902
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,592
Ways to pay are going to be more prevalent

903
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,152
Four different use cases right so everything is

904
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
Actually

905
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,712
Use case appropriate

906
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,016
You know you won't be using

907
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,296
A ring

908
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,088
The tap and pay

909
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,112
Charlie at

910
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,392
A restaurant

911
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,952
Possible but I wouldn't necessarily

912
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,000
Think that that's the go-to thing for

913
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:31,840
Example of a car dealership in your buying a car or

914
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,400
Or if even you're at a high-end luxury retailer

915
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
Weather

916
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,240
Sensitive very hands-on experience

917
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,520
You may not be

918
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,544
You're not in a rush

919
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
You're not

920
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:46,432
It's not giving you that kind of seemed like instant gratification pop and go quick

921
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
Convenience as you might expect

922
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,016
For transit or four

923
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,088
Parking are for a quick service restaurant or

924
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:58,208
You know that and I think there's going to be many different payment options

925
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
Better all states

926
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,024
Temperature at work together

927
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,792
To make payment

928
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,864
Seamless chart for the consumer

929
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,656
Got it

930
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
Total sense

931
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,496
I'm trying to imagine buying a car on

932
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,800
Credit and I'm like wow I need a bigger credit line

933
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,408
Or really terrible car I'm not sure

934
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,344
With the idea of you mention security so so let's talk about the protections that are given to the consumer

935
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,416
When they do this because I can think of a couple things

936
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,696
There's obviously like

937
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:35,072
Oh my gosh formation is going through the air and we talked about how that's not actually a payment information that's a token

938
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
So yeah

939
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:40,192
But then there's also worries about you know NFC sticker RFID sniffing

940
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,520
There's probably worried about people stealing your ring or

941
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,080
Gloves I mean I lose my gloves all the time

942
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,128
So how do you deal with those kind of issues

943
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,456
So they're each different I'll take them one at a time so

944
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,992
Whatsapp sniffing

945
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,552
Alrighty it is

946
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
Tokenize

947
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,928
So the great thing about a token is that it's not only a surrogate value

948
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,976
And it doesn't only have

949
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,536
You know a unique code your cryptographic

950
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
Psychesec

951
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
Create a unique code

952
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,400
So we also lock it lock that token down

953
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,424
Buy Channel

954
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,472
In some cases by merchants

955
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
So here's what I mean

956
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,544
If I have

957
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
A token

958
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,128
Available on my Langley ring

959
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,968
There's some specific domain controllers that are around that

960
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,016
Cytokines only going to be able to

961
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
To be used

962
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,600
Ancient Oculus location

963
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,648
Coming son the device

964
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:36,000
So if someone were to sniff it and put it on white plastic for example

965
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,048
And swipe it at the point of sale

966
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,352
MasterCard with no in the back end

967
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
But that transaction

968
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
You know that.

969
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,192
Credential mother had been compromised

970
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
And we would not allow that turn back

971
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,080
So because of these domain controllers it becomes

972
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,663
Much more secure because even if a token is

973
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:57,247
Stolen and we do assume that the hackers are going to hack

974
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,551
And that it will be data compromises

975
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,087
Throw the whole purpose

976
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
Tokenization

977
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,903
Was to make sure that the data

978
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,463
If it was comp if it were to be compromised

979
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,231
But useless

980
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,303
And that's what we've accomplished with it

981
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
Innovation technology

982
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,119
Okay awesome

983
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,655
And then

984
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,679
About

985
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,215
Like someone just grabbing my

986
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,239
Mike loves her

987
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
Less likely my ring

988
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,383
I think it's going to be different depending on the device

989
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,687
So this is like a multi-layered answer but

990
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,223
I'll try to make it simple

991
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:29,759
Some

992
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,807
Wearables are jewelry or

993
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,111
Some devices that

994
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,647
You know we're talking about right now

995
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,719
Will only work if they're Tethered to your phone

996
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:43,583
This may be because for example with ringly the whole point of a ringly ring

997
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,375
That is only active

998
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,167
If it's connected to your phone

999
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,959
Because its purpose main purpose

1000
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,727
Did she give you notice

1001
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,519
Applications of things that are happening

1002
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
On your device

1003
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,359
And so with the wiggly rangaiah

1004
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,639
Expect the payment

1005
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,431
Nationality will only be enabled

1006
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,759
If there is that tether if you're in close proximity to your phone

1007
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,551
Someone grabs your ringing

1008
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,855
When you know a mile away and then

1009
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Another local

1010
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
Whatever

1011
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,719
Store that had a contactless terminal

1012
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,999
It wouldn't work

1013
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:15,583
There's other examples like Fitness bands that may

1014
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,375
Had built in

1015
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,215
Persistent authentication Technologies

1016
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,007
You authenticate one

1017
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,567
In the morning you put your mini band on

1018
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,943
You know that you're able to use it for access to get into your workplace or into your computer at things like that

1019
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,223
Like

1020
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,039
Is there something in that device called

1021
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:39,391
Persistent authentication and if it's attached to your skin

1022
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
You know your biometric

1023
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
Check signal

1024
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,743
That is still on your hand in that

1025
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:47,071
That's your hand it knows that that's the magic of the minivan

1026
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:50,143
It will know the only enable payment functionality

1027
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,679
When not persistent

1028
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,983
It won't work otherwise

1029
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,799
So again I'm giving different examples

1030
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,871
Each of these wearables employee kind of a difference

1031
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,663
Methodology for

1032
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,687
Securing the payment

1033
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,503
There are some examples though where there won't be

1034
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,319
Authentication and it won't require a tether

1035
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,647
Ian in that instance we're relying on the fact that it is

1036
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,695
Tokenized

1037
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,231
That there are

1038
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,047
What you can do without additional cardholders

1039
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,095
Application of course with MasterCard

1040
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,887
There's always be reliability

1041
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,263
You know it's something that we have is a benefit for cardholders globally

1042
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:31,615
And today for example if your physical card is lost or stolen which

1043
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
Very well

1044
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,919
Adidas happens all the time

1045
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,479
You as a cardholder are not responsible for

1046
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,271
Any transaction that happened

1047
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,063
You know after it's lost

1048
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,879
So long as you were reported in a reasonable.

1049
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,183
So there are going to still be those

1050
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:48,255
Use cases and again I think they'll be less and less

1051
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,327
Gets better and better and we are encouraging

1052
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,911
Enjoy that are manufacturers to build in

1053
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,727
Some kind of additional security protection

1054
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,311
But with tokenization is zero liability protection

1055
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,615
George

1056
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,223
Awesome yes my credit card does get stolen like at least once a year

1057
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,039
I don't blame you and I appreciate that

1058
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,319
MasterCard

1059
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,367
And also Visa very quick to let me know

1060
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
So

1061
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,231
Can I pay with this

1062
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,279
With these types of devices

1063
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,327
At any contactless payment

1064
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,375
Place or do I have to okay

1065
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,447
It kind of sounded like there were side deals that had to happen

1066
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,495
And it's not at all

1067
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,615
Not at all she has to do is actually turn on

1068
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
Kentucky Kentucky

1069
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,407
Functionality

1070
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,223
So the large majority so

1071
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:44,319
North of 90% I don't know the exact number but more than 90%

1072
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,391
New terminals that are shipping today

1073
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,743
Are shipping with NFC technology in there already

1074
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,535
Because it has a mansion

1075
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,863
Before it's based on the same technology that powers

1076
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,911
And so

1077
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
Terminal

1078
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,007
Exactly

1079
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,287
Who's not speaking matters

1080
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
Credit cards

1081
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:10,943
That's right and so we know we're in the midst of a liability

1082
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,735
We're in the midst of a ship

1083
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:17,087
To migrate terminals in the United States for security reasons

1084
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,647
Nils frahm just magnetic stripe

1085
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
She also

1086
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,463
BMV chicken pen

1087
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,743
And

1088
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:27,327
I said happened and Merchants Merchants go through their regular

1089
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
Terminal

1090
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
Replacement cycle

1091
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,679
You know we expect that most of the terminal

1092
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
Well

1093
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,519
Ready made with this NFC

1094
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,591
Functionality to do is turn it on

1095
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
Nice

1096
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,431
And I can be walking through pain with

1097
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,759
Leaves of my hand with knots of my head who knows

1098
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,575
Even perhaps I have to ask because

1099
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:54,975
I just saw the Amazon is talking about letting people pay with a selfie and I know that MasterCard introduced this

1100
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:58,047
Can a concept I don't think it's real yet but I could be wrong

1101
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,095
Where are you guys going next

1102
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,191
So we could we actually so salty pay

1103
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,751
Is something that we've been talking about

1104
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,335
Amazon

1105
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,127
Introducing at As A New Concept

1106
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,711
But we're making available or API

1107
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,247
Integrated into master bath

1108
