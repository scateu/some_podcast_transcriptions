Hey

53
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
Heaven

54
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,520
I am super excited about this product we saw it at

55
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
CES

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
Amazing

57
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
Everybody who has smart

58
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
Connected light bulbs

59
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
It is upset with the fact

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
If you turn the switch off

61
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
Bulbs

62
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,296
You're both stopped working

63
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
There's now a solution

64
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
And it's an easy solution

65
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
So easy

66
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
Lutron is made

67
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,768
The Aurora which is a device that you're going to stick on your traditional lights

68
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
And then

69
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,632
It basically converts them to a Smart Switch without any

70
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,448
Wiring in a screwdriver eating anything like that

71
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
And

72
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
I

73
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
So excited about the

74
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,336
It's cuz I'm about to move into a rental house

75
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,944
And I have Philips hue light bulbs that I'm going to want to connect this to

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,248
Then I can basically in my rental house

77
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
How smart lighting that doesn't break

78
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
When someone turns off

79
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
Wichita

80
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:43,744
Whatever that is Keith this it this is interesting because you said there's no wiring involves right

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Traditional you'd have to

82
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
Swap out a switch

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
To make it tomorrow

84
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
It literally has a little

85
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,728
I caught like a plastic round part that goes over your existing light switch

86
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,800
And then on top of that you basically snapping a

87
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Rotary

88
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,128
Dial

89
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,992
And the product has a queen-size battery that lasts for 3 years

90
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,040
That's it you just snap it on

91
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Yeah

92
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
So you can turn on your lights

93
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
From the switch

94
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Nobody will be like

95
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
You've broken my functionality

96
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,351
And it also helps because people who don't

97
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:25,215
Know about Smart Homes are do not want to talk to like Madam and tell her to turn on and off the lights

98
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
This is wonderful

99
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
The downside to this

100
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
Is

101
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
It only works if you like

102
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
And you have to have a hue

103
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,687
You do not however have to have a flu shot

104
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
So yeah

105
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
You win some you lose

106
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,343
Yeah you been using me for this so you have to have some kind of

107
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,879
Sometimes Bridge box

108
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
If you already have one

109
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,463
It's really a non-issue

110
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:51,327
The other thing I question the price at $40 a pop because

111
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,655
There's not much to this thing so I would look at things like that and like

112
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
Panel

113
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
A piece of plastic and a battery and

114
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
What radio

115
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,311
Save you a ton of time

116
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Keeper

117
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
Then irregular

118
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Smart Switch

119
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:09,503
And I would say I mean again if someone who's moving into a rental and I'm sure we're going to have a show all about

120
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,319
Gadgets that Stacy is put into a rental unit to make it

121
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,623
Behave intelligently

122
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,975
But as someone in that position I was actually thinking about

123
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,071
I have become dependent on my Smart switches that I have throughout my

124
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
My home

125
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,631
And what am I going to do to replace a

126
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,423
Now the answer is

127
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
Buy a bunch of expense

128
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,799
They're still like $15 a ball

129
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
So it's still an investment

130
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
When you're talking about like having legs

131
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
4 downlights or something

132
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
But

133
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
Then you never have to get up

134
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Couch

135
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,551
Yay

136
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,879
So this should actually work even if like you're humming

137
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Yes

138
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
It should

139
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
So I'm actually getting

140
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,839
Some of these so in about a week or two when I finally moved into my new house

141
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
Hallelujah

142
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
Try them out

143
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,751
Write a review and tell you guys about it on the Pike

144
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Cast because

145
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Also

146
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
In lighting

147
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,639
Wise

148
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:13,503
The company that is famous for its $20 camera and the fact that it makes profit

149
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Has

150
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
Launched LIPA

151
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
Oops

152
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,903
And basically with the wise light bulbs you can buy

153
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,719
A 4-pack for 30 bucks which I did so

154
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
Going to try these out there

155
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Ship in the middle of June

156
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
And unfortunately they will not work

157
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,911
With the Philips Hue Lutron setup

158
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
But why it does not work

159
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
With Google

160
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
Assistant

161
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,479
It does and this actually just happened earlier this week and some people may go into their Google Assistant

162
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,575
Settings and not find wise in there to link to their account

163
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
Is it a staged rollout

164
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
It should have for me earlier this week

165
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,583
And linked It Up by like I would with anything else but

166
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:06,239
I think there's still some work that needs to be done because they're testing it with my Nest holographic all the nest

167
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,311
It's going to be Google home hub or whatever

168
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,175
When I tell the Google Assistant to show like my driveway where I have a wyzecam

169
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,527
Sometimes it takes 5 seconds and it works sometimes it takes 15 seconds

170
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,415
Think there's some optimization that really need to happen

171
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
However

172
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
I'm thrilled that it's finally here

173
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,047
And I would expect those optimizations to happen and things

174
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
Better

175
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
You know as again

176
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:37,215
Staged rollout usually things are like what is demand for this how can we optimize for this

177
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
We'll see then

178
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Right

179
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
I presume that when these bulbs

180
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
How to

181
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
Cancel pre-order right now

182
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,407
Expect automatically work with

183
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
Google Assistant

184
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,223
Because that integration is already there

185
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
Watusi

186
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,087
Just to be clear of those balls that you ordered

187
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
Cartoon

188
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
Snot color

189
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,255
But for the price I was like heck yeah they're like

190
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
Less at their 7

191
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
Which is

192
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
Excellent

193
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
Christ will see how long they last

194
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
They're only in the a19 so

195
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
If you burn down

196
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,287
And I should also mention

197
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
Four people cuz why is his

198
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,127
They're in a row right now they just launched their sensor

199
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
Can't we talked about last week

200
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
All of these work

201
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
Proprietary sub

202
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
It's 915

203
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
What they're using

204
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
Xian Subway

205
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:33,023
But it's not going to work with a Bluetooth there's a beer things like that so

206
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
That is a

207
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
A little bit of a bummer

208
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
Your trade off here is

209
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
It's so cheap

210
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,007
So you don't need a hub for this

211
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
Connect directly to Wi-Fi so

212
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
Yay for that but

213
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,151
It will work with like the sensors in

214
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
Basically

215
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,271
You can use like normal things like scheduling vacation mode

216
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
You can also

217
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
Group the lights in the wise app

218
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Control them is one

219
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
There's no light switch them

220
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:07,583
We'll get there and it works with shift so I wonder actually you'd have latency that

221
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Everybody hates

222
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,423
I wonder if you could actually connect

223
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
Bia Italy

224
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
The Hue stuff off to play around

225
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
So we'll see what happens here but

226
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,967
Smoking hot deal otherwise light bulbs if you're in the wise world

227
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991
Maybe try these out

228
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,135
For cheap mine I mean these things could replace my cheapie Cree bulb so I tend to buy

229
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,463
I know you said cheap but I'm going to say creep

230
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
As in Comcast

231
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,047
Is creeping on your health

232
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,351
CNBC reporter this week

233
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
The Comcast

234
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
Was working on some sort of device

235
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,471
It was going to be focused on people's hell

236
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
They said it was a smart speaker

237
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,567
Comcast later clarified

238
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
It's actually going to be

239
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
Sensor

240
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
And what it sounds like

241
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,479
Emotion detection sensor

242
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Yeah

243
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
It's going to use algorithm

244
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
Determined

245
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Is someone moving around the house

246
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
Yes that means there

247
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Not Dead

248
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,951
Are they moving at this range

249
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
Yes that mean

250
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
Things are probably pretty healthy

251
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,887
And we talked about this a couple times in the show but there are definite research studies that show things like

252
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Hey

253
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,775
How many times a day a person goes to the bathroom is an indicator of how healthy they are

254
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,103
And so you can see Comcast pulling

255
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,431
Data like that from the motion sensor to give

256
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,479
Some sort of Health score or

257
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:33,343
Let people know that their loved ones are okay without involving the camera or anything weird

258
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,415
Right and help Focus

259
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Comcast cable

260
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,535
They're going to pitch this towards people with

261
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Etcetera

262
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,911
Please talk to Lourdes Hospital licorice Engadget about using devices

263
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
Hospitals as well so

264
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,775
Aye yai battling mainstream

265
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,103
Consumers that are healthy healthy or going to

266
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,943
Going on a desperate haste there's a huge need for this

267
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
Species or population

268
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:08,159
Yeah and I actually get I filled a couple questions from people when they find out what I do about aging-in-place like there

269
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,719
What can I get for my parents so I know that there are

270
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,583
We may not want them at our house is a relatively younger and healthier person

271
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
But we may want them for

272
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
I left

273
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
And

274
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
Not having a camera is going to be

275
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
But you'll have to wait

276
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
Comcast is going to start testing this at the end of

277
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,871
2019 release date

278
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
Is probably 20 20 or

279
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
Possibly even later

280
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,247
The other question that's raises in my mind

281
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
And is holy cow

282
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
What kind of Privacy Rule

283
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
Rosewill Comcast

284
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
Map to follow

285
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
And

286
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,303
Look at how Comcast is like really Building Services in the Smart Hub I have long said that they have

287
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
Very forward-looking

288
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,887
Very good at offering

289
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
Compelling services in this is

290
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Possibly another one

291
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
Yes maybe definitely

292
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
Branching out

293
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,079
I just don't know

294
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
And I could be just as arguable quotes

295
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,663
They have a stigma

296
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
Cable operations

297
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,295
Customer service in service and general is not good

298
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
That is arguable

299
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
I'm sure many people are happy with

300
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
The compass that's fine

301
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
But I wonder if they can overcome

302
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,743
On people who haven't believe

303
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
And also

304
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
People worry about how much

305
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
Other data Comcast already Jets

306
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
Yeah you know between

307
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,703
Your internet you so maybe

308
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
MTV cetera

309
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,567
Do you really want now get very personal data

310
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
Going to them

311
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,407
Well I will let you know because

312
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,479
Again in about 2 weeks I'm going to become a Comcast

313
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
I say two weeks it's actually

314
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,903
This week's podcast will be produced in Austin

315
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,463
Ashley next week's will be produced in Oz

316
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,279
What time it goes out I will be in Seattle

317
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,887
But I will become a Comcast customer so I'll let you know how

318
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,775
I'm dying to know how your experience goes

319
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,591
They're my backyard here in Philadelphia

320
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Yes and your Verizon FiOS

321
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
Yes I am

322
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,039
Also this week in chip news because I can't leave the chips

323
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Out of this mediatek

324
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Which

325
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
Is a Taiwanese chip company that

326
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,207
Came to prominence for making

327
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,559
Really good soces at a lower price than Qualcomm

328
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
They have done really well in the smart

329
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Market

330
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,263
And now they've announced date what they call a rich iot program

331
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,383
And what this is is a bunch of their chipsets are going to have the ability

332
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
2

333
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,223
Do a eye on them at a lower battery

334
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Consumption

335
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:46,367
And this is going to be for voice so AI algorithms associate with boys

336
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,415
With object recognition

337
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Computer vision

338
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:54,047
And then also for powering displays so all of this is the smart home stuff

339
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
Design for

340
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Again

341
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
Low battery consumption

342
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Cheap pricing

343
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,007
And the ability to have some sort of intelligence

344
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,823
All this means from a consumer perspective

345
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,895
Is we're going to see a lot of devices come on the market with Laura

346
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:13,503
Yeah just to give a vacation all because I followed them in the smartphone

347
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
Tablet market for years

348
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,903
If you take a look at two very similar products whether to phone or tablet doesn't matter

349
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Run has a

350
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
Qualcomm chip one has a mediatek chip

351
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
You probably looking at

352
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
Andrew East I-25

353
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,095
Percent cost

354
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
Difference on the low side

355
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Wow

356
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
At least

357
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
Cheap displays, your way

358
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
All right

359
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,455
That is it that news and let's talk about sex

360
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Security specifically uses

361
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
Security at 4

362
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
Vehicles in best practices

363
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,135
So one of the best practices for security

364
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,695
Patching is over there updates when I

365
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,279
When people ask me like what can I do to make sure my connected devices are secure

366
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
I tell them all the stuff about hate

367
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,631
Google and see how they react

368
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
Problems are vulnerabilities

369
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
Bounty program

370
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,311
Good passwords and I always ask and I'm like they should have over the air update

371
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:15,455
What GM is now saying that it will offer over the air updates to most of its Vehicles by 22

372
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,503
I think this is good

373
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,575
I do drive a Tesla and it updated software all the time

374
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,647
Most automakers have not done this in a

375
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:28,255
Heart is because they were worried about connecting cars to the internet because it introduces

376
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,327
It is a surface area of attack in

377
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
It could be scary

378
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
Yes

379
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
I know you have your Tesla and

380
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,775
You can have any software updates and haven't had issues and so on so forth

381
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
IC

382
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
Tesla as a leader in this

383
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:48,479
Kinetic artistry

384
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Very capable

385
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
I am a little leery when

386
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,415
GM and others I'm sure there will be other car manufacturers get into this space

387
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,231
I just don't have the faith that

388
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
It will work

389
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
Properly

390
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,375
All the time and it needs to and I say that because just look at

391
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,727
Not quite the same situation but the aircraft

392
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
Software introduced problem

393
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,847
I would say in something like that

394
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,175
What the challenge that's not an over-the-air

395
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
Correct

396
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
Yes

397
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,063
It's a testing problem and I think

398
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,855
The capability

399
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
Is really important

400
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,231
Challenge associated with that capability is too full

401
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
1

402
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
You have to secure that

403
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
Connection to

404
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,399
If you can change the functionality of a vehicle

405
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
Anytime you want

406
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,287
That doesn't add a responsibility and QA it's an added responsibility

407
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
In terms of life cycle

408
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,615
Software lifecycle management

409
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,407
And hopefully

410
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
GM it has

411
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,503
The capabilities and it is aware of

412
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,551
So it is kind of like going cuz like

413
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,111
Now we're seeing with the Boeing 747

414
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
737 Max

415
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,975
We're talking about like oh they were unaware that

416
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
This update actually

417
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,583
Change the functionality of this particular button

418
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,167
A machine like that

419
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:16,799
Cedar stained with every line of code does it how

420
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,639
You're right it's more about that not the delivery mechanism it is more about the testing

421
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,991
I don't know something just skeeves me out about this site I guess I just don't

422
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
Faith energy

423
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
That's a person

424
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,903
And that's something all of these companies are going to have to deal with

425
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
And

426
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:38,815
If since we're talking about it I'll bring up the fact that there's an opinion article in the New York Times this week all about

427
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
Driver data

428
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
And

429
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
How customers

430
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
Consumer to buy

431
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
Why cars are not aware

432
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,311
Not aware of the type of data that

433
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Parking

434
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Gather

435
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,383
This is my man named Bill

436
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,687
Handy who is President Chief Executive

437
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,735
Of the Auto Care Association

438
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,527
The Articles actually called

439
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,063
Your car knows when you gain weight

440
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,415
Which I guess it does cuz they do have sensors in the seats now that you're there

441
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
I don't know if I

442
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,279
I want my car to be like you should drive me lesson walk mower

443
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,583
Possibly

444
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
But the point there is like

445
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
Hey

446
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,447
When you have over the air updates

447
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,287
You also have this two-way communication where your car could be like

448
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
Tattling on you in a way that

449
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,895
I know you had to stick those OBD Port monitors

450
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:30,527
I've also wonder and this is for cars that have built-in Connectivity Source not like

451
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,111
You will connect your car to your home internet and get the

452
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,391
The downloading update there

453
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,999
So I don't know how big these updates can be and probably

454
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,303
Does Tesla actually tell you or you just

455
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Say

456
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,863
It just shows you hey I update your software

457
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,471
I'm sometimes it'll tell you anything cuz a time estimate like this will take about 40 minutes

458
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
Some of that dates are quite

459
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,823
But Tesla pays for my connectivity

460
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Yes

461
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,639
I don't know that

462
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,455
GM. Blind a Chevy Bolt

463
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:05,599
I would love to see them spell that out because I I don't

464
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,623
Use the

465
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,183
LTE integrated into my Chevy Volt

466
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
I get software updates

467
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,047
Dealer which is very rare mean

468
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,095
Once a year I get an oil change

469
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,375
Rotate tires every

470
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,423
Power off Lionel drive that much

471
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
So

472
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,751
I'd like to know that you have to pay for that

473
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,287
Realty service

474
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,335
Jesus all right well

475
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,663
Well I hope they do that and have data

476
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,503
Car sharing data other things sharing data

477
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,903
What is the first anniversary of the general data protection regulations from the EU

478
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
And

479
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
It's time to say

480
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Kush

481
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
What's happened

482
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,047
He answered

483
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
At least in the EU not much here in the US

484
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,751
Just as a refresher gdpr basically cave

485
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,287
People rights around their data

486
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
And

487
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,663
You as an individual or as a citizen of the EU basically could say

488
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,455
Hey stop collecting my day

489
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
What data are you collecting use

490
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Requested

491
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,183
You could ask companies to change data that wasn't right you could retroactively pool access to your data

492
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,767
The EU has published data about

493
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,815
The number of cases and

494
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
Things like that associated with

495
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
This legislation

496
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,703
Should I pull citizens and

497
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,751
As of March 2019

498
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
Two-thirds of EU citizen

499
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,639
Hold said they knew with gdpr was

500
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,223
They are about 1/3 a little over 1/3 new what it is

501
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
Tails

502
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
And

503
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,063
Over half said

504
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,879
Yes they know that there is an agency out there trying to

505
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
Protect their data

506
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
What that means

507
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
Cases is

508
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
They had

509
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,815
A lot a lot they have

510
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
I was like

511
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,655
281000

512
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
Yeah

513
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
And these cases are just

514
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
Complaints maybe maybe

515
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,543
Customer found that there

516
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,871
Data wasn't being cryptic because that's required as part of

517
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,895
Tpr's well

518
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
Yeah like a half of them we're just like

519
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Complaints

520
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,575
Almost 90000 of data breach notifications and then the rest were

521
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
I don't know whatever

522
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,280
But two-thirds of those cases have been closed I presume to people satisfaction because

523
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
1%

524
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,352
Cases have been appealed

525
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,656
And the rest are still ongoing

526
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,216
This is great because it shows how active

527
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
These

528
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
Restrictions are being

529
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,056
Recognized by consumers

530
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,384
Being questioned cementation questioning

531
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
Licensing issue

532
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,736
I think it's great for the night

533
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:46,880
Yeah and I haven't seen it at wholesale stoppage of the European economy

534
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
So also good there

535
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,488
As part of this and maybe because

536
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,096
Maybe because it's Brad Smith and he's being a thought leader here but Brad Smith over at Microsoft

537
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,632
Is called for

538
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,168
The US

539
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,960
To implement its own

540
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
Version of gdpr

541
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
An Apple has also called for the

542
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
Best and

543
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,640
That's now Microsoft and app

544
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
Apple saying

545
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,712
Hey this law isn't terrible

546
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,760
Let's get something like that here

547
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,600
And the big things that they're focused on is

548
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,440
You have to have a reason to process the data you can just gather data for

549
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,744
So you don't like your car can't just be like

550
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
This is how much someone weighs

551
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,584
Personal data must be encrypted

552
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:31,424
People in consumers have a right to a copy of their data

553
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,496
And they have a right to ask for their data to be.

554
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
I'm all for it

555
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
I'm not going to lie

556
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,200
A sticking point

557
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,016
Is who enforces the rules

558
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,368
Will in the EU they created a separate agency

559
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Who does that

560
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
So

561
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
I would imagine

562
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:58,304
We would have some sort of federal agency FTC

563
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
I know there's lots of

564
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,424
Debate

565
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,984
The FTC resent not the FTC

566
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:12,384
I hate the creation of new government agencies with the FTC can be like really held over by politics

567
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
But

568
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,736
Something is better than nothing I don't know or not

569
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,624
But if we did though

570
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,416
Not about gdpr

571
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:28,000
But about enforcing privacy rules Mozilla has created a

572
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
Petition

573
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,816
Calling on Amazon

574
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:35,424
To make sure all the Smart Home Products are all the connected products sold on its site

575
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,448
Come with a privacy

576
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
Because not everything does

577
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
I think that's actually not a number

578
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
I think

579
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:47,456
Having Amazon or a federal legislation actually helps because if it's Amazon

580
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
What happens is

581
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,648
You'll have to click through or see a privacy policy associated with the device if everyone has one is not a competitive advantage

582
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Are people who don't

583
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,208
Two processes may be a little

584
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
So horsing everyone to behave

585
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,584
According to the same rules is actually a nice thing to

586
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,680
Is not part of this conversation company we're going to talk about a little bit next

587
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,728
That would be correct

588
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,288
I'll take what is Google for $500

589
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Yay

590
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,432
About the new glass Google Glass

591
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,760
Yes the new one is for Enterprise has its fancy rats

592
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
Cheaper and

593
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
More battery efficient

594
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
I believe in better

595
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,856
Just generally better

596
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,136
It's more better

597
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,976
And another little news bits

598
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Savant

599
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
Which is a

600
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,888
I always call it the apple of smart home systems like professional smart home systems they have rolled out

601
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,240
How can support including something pretty neat which is circuit breaker control

602
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,288
Explain why the school

603
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:49,408
So it's about already has a circuit breaker controls but now they have a

604
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
Pinion module

605
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
That

606
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,504
Is Chromecast compatible so

607
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,600
Like I'm assuming I could like when I'm swapping out switches and what not

608
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
Instead of running up and down two flights of stairs

609
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,184
See if I switch the right breaker

610
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
Mentally I could

611
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
Turn the breaker off using homekit

612
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,072
Yes that is my thought here to end

613
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,864
This was actually a future

614
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,168
I feel like Savant launched it back at

615
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,008
Syria in 2017 and there are actually several

616
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,080
Other professionals EDS type installers who are

617
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,384
Messing around with circuit breaker

618
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,456
Boxes in control of those in Part B

619
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Because

620
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,040
They were thinking about things like demand response in the future

621
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
Electricity

622
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,112
And apparently really wealthy people like

623
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,952
Dedicated control of these things I don't know but it was a big deal

624
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
So

625
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,560
This is it it's a nice product it's a nice add onto a nice system if

626
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,144
And in fact that homekit support does go beyond just

627
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,168
Circuit breaker band

628
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,544
It works with light bulbs in their LED DMX LED light strips

629
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,616
It's a broader solution

630
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,896
Yes and

631
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,992
There is a new smart clock in town the Lenovo smart clock for

632
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
Google

633
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,368
Have already gone live

634
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,440
And this device ships on June 2nd $79

635
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:09,024
I actually saw this at CES this year back in January

636
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,328
And I've wondered about I thought it was just like a

637
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,888
A reference is on or something when it when I walk into the

638
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,448
I guess I should say for the Press

639
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,264
But no it said it was an actual projects

640
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,568
Little smart clock it's like a

641
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,128
Maybe a forage displayed at 4

642
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
IPS screen

643
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
It looks like

644
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,248
The Lenovo smart display that I have

645
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
Obviously it smaller

646
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,184
It's not something to watch a video on and do things regular screen or larger screen

647
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,488
It does have a 6 watt speaker

648
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,816
You can add it to a home speaker group

649
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,400
It's got the microphone privacy switch that the nest Hub has

650
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
School

651
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,472
And yeah I mean it's just perfect

652
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
Size 4

653
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,544
Display

654
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
Especially one with camera

655
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
Cuz it doesn't have one

656
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,664
On their nightstand

657
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,736
Another Google home

658
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
Nice

659
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Okay

660
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
And

661
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
We've got a

662
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,368
Other tiny little bits of news

663
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
Which is the

664
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,232
A German smart thermostat maker has

665
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:15,328
Stay home 2 compatible smart AC controller

666
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,472
It's really for the UK and EU area so, coming or going to get here

667
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,008
In the US at least

668
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,080
But they make a nice looking

669
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
Thermostat product

670
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:32,224
You do and they make a nice radiator turning knob date they make some really good looking

671
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,040
So this is basically you can

672
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,600
AC controls to your home with us

673
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:44,256
So this will work ethics and also

674
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
690

675
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,120
Amazon so

676
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,424
It's available there for 90 pound

677
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,728
Guess that's roughly

678
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,288
100 letter $10

679
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,592
But it doesn't matter cuz you can't buy here

680
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,920
This is our gift to our UK listeners

681
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:06,528
Find a little bit of news is Arduino has available

682
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,552
And we

683
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,088
We love our Arduino

684
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,648
The cheapest one

685
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,440
Is the Nano every it's a

686
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
Actually $10

687
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
It's got a microcontroller

688
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
She's got it

689
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,400
Clash a rama and

690
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,192
They also have the Nano

691
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:28,800
33 iot is $18 it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and

692
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,592
Also a microcontroller

693
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
Again

694
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
M32

695
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
Gabby's abuser

696
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
Small tomato

697
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:44,416
Products project Etc not a smart home system

698
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,048
I gave us play around with some stuff they have

699
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,376
To Nubia Bluetooth low-energy boards as well

700
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
So

701
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,472
You don't just check out if you're

702
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:02,848
You're hankering for a project and you went you don't need much you just want to build something that does a little something

703
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:10,272
All right and now it is our favorite time of the week it's time for The Internet of Things podcast hotline where we listen

704
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,808

To get into my new home so I can actually try the encode lot which is their wife

715
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,224
It is about time

716

All right

717
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,040
So this week's voicemail is from

718
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
Josh

719
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
Let's hear it

720
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,392
Hi Stacy and Kevin this is Josh.

721
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,416
Eagan Minnesota

722
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,976
Please feel free to use this on your show if you'd like

723
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:55,072
My question is regarding automation I really would like

724
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,888
To be able to know with high degree of accuracy

725
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,216
If people are in or not in a given room

726
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
The bedroom

727
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
The family room

728
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
Wherever so that I

729
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
Can adjust light

730
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,616
Denim-on-denim off

731
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,920
Depending upon if there is anybody in

732
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
That room

733
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,808
And I'm just wondering what's the best solution for that what's up is it a combination of sensors

734
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,136
Korath our special sensors to help with that kind of a problem

735
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,440
How what is the best way to

736
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,464
No

737
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,512
If there is somebody in a room or not

738
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,304
Thank you so much for all your help

739
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
Appreciate it

740
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Josh

741
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,888
This is something

742
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
Men

743
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704
Kevin and I've been talking about

744
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,264
Years and years and years

745
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,360
And we actually have some options for you which is a surprise

746
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,152
Because we looked at this

747
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,224
You know when you when you left your voicemail we're like okay

748
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,528
We don't have anything great for it we've got

749
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
Motion sensors

750
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,880
Which will tell you that someone has entered a room and you could use

751
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,160
Turn on lights in

752
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
AC in

753
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
Things like that

754
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,256
But it's kind of sucky if you want to do like

755
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,560
Personalization or something a little bit

756
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,376
But we just discovered

757
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
A new product

758
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
Buy in

759
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,704
Tell her things

760
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,240
We discovered

761
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,544
Rumor me it is a

762
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,360
Sensor that basically

763
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,432
The Bluetooth readings from your phone and uses that to say out

764
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
Kevin's phone

765
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,480
Kevin

766
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Has entered the room

767
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
And

768
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,088
You can buy a starter kit

769
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,160
For $124

770
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,000
And a sensor on its own without the starter kit

771
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,792
It's going to be $70

772
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
What does this do

773
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
Well

774
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,192
Basically just says this Smartphone is

775
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
Mounts on the ceiling

776
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
And

777
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,312
It's actually kind of cool

778
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,128
I do everything reminds me

779
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,944
I got excited about the beacon technology

780
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,736
Several years back which

781
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,040
Never really made it to the smart

782
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:54,880
Yeah we talked about a company called zuly they actually made they

783
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,416
Put beacons basically

784
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,000
Smart outlets and I was super excited about them and

785
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Yeah

786
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,584
Just hasn't happened

787
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,984
I think a lot of people kiss I didn't want to do this there like that tells me that somebody is in the room

788
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,568
As opposed to what I can do and I want is

789
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
It tells me

790
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,664
A particular someone is in the room

791
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:21,760
Customizes automation controls based on purses

792
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Personal choices

793
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,648
That just hasn't happened since she's just makes sense

794
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,232
If you're carrying your phone around the house most people do I know Stacy

795
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,048
I think most people do or this evening

796
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,144
Yeah I was just going to say but a lot of people

797
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:42,752
Absolutely thin

798
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,544
Caring wearing it so

799
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,336
I think this is a great idea

800
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,176
There is a bit of a downside because of his

801
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
It doesn't work

802
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
Anastasia

803
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,088
So it does work with some but not all Philips Hue smart bulbs

804
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,416
Works with lifx original and mini smart bulbs

805
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,976
The Bose sound wireless speakers

806
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
And ecobee

807
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,096
Yeah which is a smallest when you think about

808
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:14,496
Product that is not what they made for worship Google or works with matinee program play

809
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
To that program

810
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,128
Because then the whole world approximately

811
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,432
I would also say that the wages work

812
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,248
Is whoever set this up becomes

813
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
The Room Master

814
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,856
I really like the state of I am the Ambassador

815
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
I am done

816
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
What was at the GateKeeper

817
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,208
The key master key master

818
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
There we go

819
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
Ghostbusters

820
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:41,632
Anyway as a roommaster whenever you enter the room all settings will revert to your preference

821
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:45,984
And when you leave it will revert to the next highest ranked person in the room

822
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,288
Oh that's the problem with the kids

823
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,104
Isn't that guy is he ranked higher than me

824
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,896
Oh Lord

825
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,456
I'm going to say that's going to be a problem would like the spouses

826
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
My husband be like

827
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,528
Why is it suddenly so hot and

828
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,832
How it's so wonderful

829
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,624
Thanks nobody ever

830
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,464
Josh this is your problem I'm not owning this one cuz I have not going to rain tonight

831
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:12,864
There you go so Josh that is our solution for you I wish we had something that works with everything

832
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,400
What is more comprehensive

833
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:18,496
There is another option I mean aside from the motion sensor switch

834
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:23,360
There are tons of motion sensor options were there in a light switch

835
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,688
Or they're just a standalone Center like that the borrower

836
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,480
There are tons of motion sensors out there

837
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,040
There and their

838
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,600
Not a problem did you have a hub in most cases

839
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,928
Just for the show we also found this

840
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,952
Minute Prada

841
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,256
Oh yes I forgot about the minute

842
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:45,376
Yeah that we can't speak to how well it works because we literally just got out of

843
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
For the show

844
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,192
Can you reach out to them already for

845
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,216
Getting some

846
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:54,848
Yes this is a security product it is a device that use lap onto a magnetic

847
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,920
East Gretta magnetic plate to your ceiling and you slept this

848
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,200
Sensor packed

849
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
Talk to it

850
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,760
And it does

851
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,296
Motion humidity

852
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
Temperature

853
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,368
Detection

854
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:11,232
It so it'll listen for window glass breakage as the

855
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
Madame agar does now

856
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
But it doesn't have

857
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,120
Tamara so the people who are focused on

858
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
Privacy error going to be

859
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
Kind of excited about

860
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,984
Set a remind me kind of like

861
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,032
Maybe something that Comcast is

862
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:30,432
So it has all of these kind of neat features plus it works with Madam a and Google Assistant

863
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:34,528
Which means you might be able to and I can't tell you until I try this

864
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,600
Use the sensors in that to control things happen

865
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
House

866
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
Again it won't

867
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,208
Detective

868
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,048
If a text doesn't detect individual

869
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,376
Rice device is $149

870
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,424
And you can get a two pack

871
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,216
230.

872
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
I think it's got a pretty sweet

873
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:00,128
It is security-focused for the most part

874
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,176
Motion detection or personal

875
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
Presence

876
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,736
President General

877
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,320
Which is why we brought it up

878
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,904
That's the key because a lot of people don't want cameras in every room

879
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
Which I totally

880
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:17,024
Yep all right we'll Josh hopefully this helps you and

881
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,608
Everyone else please stay tuned because

882
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,704
We'll have our guest Zach's Apollo who is the CEO of particle

883
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,032
He's going to be talking about a survey they just released

884
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,360
All about what industries are using iot

885
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
What use Industries

886
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,176
And

887
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:37,760
Some of the Lessons Learned as company scale

888
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
Which is a big deal

889
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,088
Before we get to that

890
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,624
We are going to hear from

891
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,024
This week's sponsor Dell Technologies

892
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,424
From The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor sponsor is Dell Technologies and today

893
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,496
We're doing by Brian Jones was a general manager for the

894
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,544
OEM and iot solutions

895
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,568
Installation at Delta

896
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:08,224
Brian I understand you were also recently asked to serve as one of the executive sponsors

897
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,784
Technologies iot and Edge

898
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,600
Can you please please share with us how your group is

899
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:20,256
Thank you thanks for having me on it's really great to have an opportunity to chat with

900
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,096
So from an alien perspective

901
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:31,520
Helping them take their IP combined it with our technology and create a new product that they take the market

902
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:36,384
And our customers have been doing iot since long before iot had a name

903
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,176
Natural

904
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,736
Place that help with the iot and adjectives

905
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,576
And so what we do is we really help customers focus on and delivery

906
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,136
Health and compress their time-to-market

907
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,928
So they focus on their it

908
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,464
We focus on

909
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,768
The technology platform in the integration of it

910
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:59,680
The second piece is really delivering tier-1 technology and that should one technology gets them the very best Quality Inn

911
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
Customer experience

912
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,312
And then the last piece is one of their multinational or they're a small software startup

913
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,872
We help them scale globally reducing cost

914
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
Complexity

915
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,944
And taking their product to a global market

916
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,528
Excellent and I understand that your division is Pretty in Pink

917
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,088
Compared to what most of my audience thinks about

918
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,880
Sunday think about Dell Technologies

919
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,928
They're thinking servers in PC

920
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,256
But your division focuses more on Factory floors than data set

921
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
It's OT

922
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
Not it

923
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
Is that right

924
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
That's right

925
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,960
Example of an oem customer is their developing software

926
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,776
So a lot of

927
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,568
Champs cancer medical device

928
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,872
They're developing the software in the actual

929
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
Scan devices

930
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,944
All of that needs to run

931
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,272
On a server ditch in a maybe it's very hard

932
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,344
Operational environment high temperature

933
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,904
Vibration and so we help them develop

934
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,304
Platform solution

935
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,888
Okay and so how does your OEM division

936
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
Really help those

937
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
Customers

938
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
Get ahead

939
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,520
We are really focused on

940
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
First

941
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,080
The IP that they're developing is

942
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,176
And we help them surround that I T with

943
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,456
The right technology +

944
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:20,576
And we're drawing from all of Dell Technologies to not just deli and seeing Hardware

945
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,720
Everything that makes up Dell technology

946
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:31,328
This is part of the pallet that we can help a customer to paint their product

947
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:35,936
And so at the Dell Technologies

948
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,728
Hardware software services

949
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
Program manager

950
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,776
Engineering

951
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,568
All of that together too

952
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:45,408
Creating that new product based on their IP and our technology

953
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,456
But that customer then takes the market

954
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
Awesome

955
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,272
So where can folks go

956
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
To learn more

957
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,832
For more information

958
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,000
Go out to Delhi nc.com

960
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,680
Hey everyone

961
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:14,080
Welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham at today's guest is Zach Supply

962
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,640
Halle who is the CEO of

963
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Particle

964
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,200
Hi Zach how are you

965
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,992
I'm doing great how are you

00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,576
Excellent all right we have not talked in

967
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Like

968
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,928
A year or two and I'm hearing that things are

969
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
Different

970
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,976
At particles so let's

971
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
Kick it off with

972
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:35,072
An update on where things are at particle

973
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,120
Probably for everyone who doesn't know you

974
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,656
Guys what you actually do

975
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,216
Yeah absolutely so

976
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,008
Backstory on particle we are

977
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,104
Internet of Things device platform so we help companies who are

978
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,152
Making Internet of Things products

979
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
Connect those products to the internet

980
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,760
Work with a bunch of different manufacturers and

981
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,552
Distributors a lot of folks

982
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,832
Made

983
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:01,184
Products that weren't yet connected and wanted to add connectivity those products

984
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,512
He also worked a lot of entrepreneurs and startups were building new products from

985
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,072
Incorporate connectivity

986
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,864
And we provide all of the

987
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,424
Connectivity networking infrastructure

988
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,216
Ranging from the hardware that's embedded

989
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,240
Buy the product

990
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,008
Chill

991
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:19,104
Networking stack to cloud services that expose devices for API

992
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,384
Everything in between

993
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
End

994
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
Right now

995
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,200
Your customers

996
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,480
I assume Spanish

997
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,760
Dammit so let's talk about

998
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:29,600
You recently did a survey where you asked about 800 Developers

999
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,672
What they're using iot for how they're building stuff

1000
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
And

1001
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
What did you find

1002
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,048
Let's let's start with the top probably Industries where I'm at

1003
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
Yeah

1004
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,400
So we'll start with where I think I accused

1005
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,704
Become most successful if we think about

1006
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,472
The market

1007
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,776
The most excited about Ice-T

1008
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,056
Oec is a

1009
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
Manufacturing

1010
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
Healthcare

1011
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,407
Energy agriculture technology

1012
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,943
Because

1013
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,991
Any technology company is

1014
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
Thinking about

1015
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,039
Some way

1016
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,087
Engage with it

1017
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,135
Interesting about that is

1018
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:07,743
Okay those Industries makes sense it makes sense that you would see this Earth heavier Industries

1019
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
With often more

1020
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,047
More expensive products

1021
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:14,655
With more like maintenance problems that those are the places where we see is you being successful

1022
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,447
I think what's interesting is was not on that

1023
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:22,335
Which is to say consumer and I think that consumer adoption of it has

1024
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,407
Of course a number of

1025
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:29,247
Like they break out successes but if you look more broadly across the industry

1026
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,783
I think we're in a little bit of

1027
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,807
The trough

1028
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,575
Can I cycle

1029
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,367
I'd like the trough of disillusionment

1030
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,415
Yes exactly

1031
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,695
Which is to say like that was a

1032
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
. we're

1033
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
Andorra founded

1034
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,535
12

1035
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,303
Really

1036
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,679
Early days of it when things will really start to take off and it was a lot of interesting excitement around consumer

1037
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,959
We're just not seeing the best

1038
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,751
Yesterday and it squeaks

1039
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
Anecdotal

1040
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,567
The customer is where

1041
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,103
More and more we're helping

1042
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,687
Connect big dirty heavy machines where there's a lot of

1043
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,783
Operational burden of managing that piece of equipment and

1044
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,087
Text people who have to deal with maintenance

1045
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
Uptime

1046
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,391
And those creator

1047
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,951
Opportunities to solve real problems variety because

1048
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
I can do a better job of making

1049
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,023
Machine

1050
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,583
He's working because I have sensors in the machine

1051
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,607
I can get it from them

1052
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,423
Machine that leads to various

1053
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,447
Very clear

1054
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,215
Solutions

1055
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,495
The problems that

1056
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,823
Meaning of these initiatives actually get out the door and do actually scale

1057
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,639
Yes cuz I feel like in the consumer

1058
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
Even today

1059
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:34,527
The use cases are not clear the expense associated with connected devices is

1060
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,295
Hi

1061
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:39,391
And the maintenance and ability to like make things work

1062
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
Pull something

1063
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
Together

1064
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,231
Is really difficult because there's no stand

1065
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:49,631
So I'm I'm with you on that so let's talk about how those kind of Trends related to

1066
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:53,471
I don't know if we want to break it out by industry cuz he may be a little bit different but

1067
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:58,591
When we start the use cases very clear a lot of the things that are happening happen

1068
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,407
Roi associate with them it's pretty easy to see

1069
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,455
What about standards like

1070
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:08,319
Howard Lee agricultural or manufacturing or healthcare companies buying the

1071
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:13,695
Is today do they think about things working across many different platforms or do they just like

1072
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,255
I need something to monitor my

1073
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
Trunks in refrigerators

1074
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,071
I need something

1075
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
Track the

1076
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,119
The placement of

1077
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,655
Seeds in my feels

1078
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:28,031
So I think it really ends up being a question of what environment is the product

1079
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:28,799
Sequoia

1080
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,567
Important

1081
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,383
Is it that it work with other products in that entire

1082
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,175
Example of like

1083
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
Factory

1084
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,247
Pretzel Factory is a place where you have

1085
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
A whole bunch of

1086
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,831
Problem

1087
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
That you want to try

1088
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,879
Find salt dr-t

1089
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
Are about the Inn

1090
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,439
Interactions of those machine

1091
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,743
For instance if I'm trying to

1092
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:53,375
You know make my manufacturing line more efficient and I want to be able to track for the levels of like work in progress

1093
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,959
Inventory I can't just have

1094
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,007
One machine for sending me that day.

1095
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,287
I need sort of all of the

1096
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,847
Machines in the line to be

1097
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,895
Giving me data and then I have a

1098
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:05,919
Problem

1099
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,687
Figure out how to get all the

1100
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,247
Hands together and so we think of that is

1101
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
Heterogeneous

1102
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,575
Which is to say like lots of different I have

1103
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,599
Nike products

1104
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,391
One another and that's where I think

1105
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
Standards are really important

1106
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
Keurig 2.0

1107
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,999
A lot of dust

1108
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
Sandra's haven't been

1109
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
Settled and are

1110
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,815
Still in development and

1111
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:29,215
Standards Wars that are going on in the crease of challenging Mini cases with successfully DuQuoin heterogeneous

1112
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,239
He'd appointment

1113
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,799
Is inhomogeneous

1114
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,847
Which is to say

1115
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,151
Widgets and I make $100,000

1116
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,431
And they're almost

1117
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,479
Deploy them all over the world

1118
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,503
And a lot of cases

1119
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,135
Supreme since we have a customer who's using us to monitor air condition

1120
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,183
Air conditioner is r

1121
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:54,559
Different air conditioners are a little different and they're in residential units in their commercial units but the fundamental principle

1122
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,095
How to operate are the same

1123
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,143
And every air conditioner is

1124
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,423
Is a stand-alone Prada

1125
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,215
So when you're trying to for insta

1126
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,239
Monitor the air

1127
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,543
And if you want to be able to improve

1128
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
Service

1129
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
Air conditioner

1130
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,175
Then you really only need data from that

1131
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,455
One device

1132
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,527
And so standards and integrating with other

1133
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,063
Machines and equipment

1134
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:21,183
Isn't as important in that environment another example this is working with a company that manufactures

1135
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,743
Dental operatory equipment the machines that are in

1136
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,303
Dentist offices

1137
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,839
Machines but they tend to be more

1138
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,119
Stand-alone equipment

1139
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,447
Not as complex of an environment at a factory

1140
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,519
And those are cases where we seen products be

1141
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,335
Successful getting to Market because essentially you're not

1142
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Waiting on

1143
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,151
Ecosystem to develop you have a

1144
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919
Product

1145
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
The problem

1146
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
Directly

1147
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,551
And the fact that there is

1148
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:52,927
Continuing standard warranty IIT doesn't really keep you from being able to go out and solve your problem

1149
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:58,815
Have you had any clients that have built out a homogeneous infrastructure

1150
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,607
And then suddenly looked up in bed like

1151
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,423
Oh I really wish we could connected to this thing

1152
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,751
Tried to move to the next level if you have what has happened

1153
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,775
What did they learn

1154
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,591
What I see happening with

1155
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:15,967
Those kinds of customers is they might say wouldn't it be nice if all these other pieces of equipment around here

1156
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,271
Connected but they're not oh well so I'll just

1157
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:21,599
Just keep trying to find other problems I can solve with this product

1158
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:22,879
And

1159
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,415
The downside is of course

1160
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,695
That means that there

1161
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:28,767
Are some interesting opportunity that are being left on the table

1162
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,047
But on the other hand

1163
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:34,911
What I find is it once people start shipping a Nike product the things they can do with it

1164
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,959
The long-term opportunities start to become

1165
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,519
Clear over time we're friends since you might say

1166
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,567
I make a widget and the reason that I want

1167
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
The widget is Kazan

1168
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,663
And I want to be able to fix it

1169
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,967
Okay that's the justification

1170
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:50,271
A little rolling it out

1171
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,831
You know what the widget also uses

1172
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,599
Filters

1173
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,879
Anna's filters

1174
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
Go battle

1175
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,999
Being used so now I can do an automatic

1176
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,583
Consumables business I can start sending people new filters

1177
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,703
Every 3 months on the filters bad or not every 3 months everytime the filter needs to be replaced

1178
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
Naga

1179
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
Subscription business

1180
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,519
And that's life

1181
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,543
Second

1182
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,311
Stage

1183
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,895
Of my IIT products and then they start thinking about what is 1/3 / Opera

1184
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,919
What time does Bracken start

1185
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:22,271
Create do something better for my customers and there's enough juice there

1186
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
There's enough

1187
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,623
Extra things to go after once you launch a Nike product

1188
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,391
That

1189
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,415
It doesn't matter

1190
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,951
How many cases that you

1191
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,767
You can't do the interesting things that require in Iraq

1192
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,815
Vices because there's there's enough

1193
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,375
To go after I get plenty busy basically

1194
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,679
Got it in the end that make sense

1195
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:44,031
When it comes to the actual business use cases that people are

1196
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,055
Deploying

1197
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,847
Particle stuff in

1198
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,871
It sounds like

1199
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,175
Remote monitoring there's a little bit of Providence

1200
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,759
4/2 or doing preventive maintenance and then a third or so or doing acid

1201
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,527
The tracking

1202
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,551
Are there

1203
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,623
Other use cases that you're seeing developed

1204
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,927
The other use cases

1205
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,999
Is that we see happening but they're less frequent are

1206
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,791
Just some kind of premium product

1207
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,447
This is the like I make a widget but I make a smart widget that's more compelling for some reason and I sell at a premium

1208
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,983
That was less than

1209
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:14,751
30%

1210
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,823
Then we have

1211
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,359
To use

1212
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,895
Particle to track

1213
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:21,919
Consumables

1214
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:25,759
Replacing filters and detergent and

1215
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,783
Black coffee

1216
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,551
Pods

1217
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,343
Those were less than

1218
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,135
And then

1219
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,927
The least common was

1220
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,463
Regulatory

1221
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
I would think that would be high

1222
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,327
So here's my I think

1223
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:44,447
Those use cases are really strong which is like let's say that you are you do natural gas

1224
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
Extraction

1225
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:50,079
And you want to track methane emissions because UTA regulate

1226
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,663
Particle

1227
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,687
And they are very

1228
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,455
Helen yusuke

1229
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
Is because

1230
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
They regulated again

1231
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,039
And so

1232
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,063
You have to do that if

1233
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,599
If you're not if you're not business

1234
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,647
And so I think that the fact that they

1235
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,415
A small orange

1236
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,439
Number customers

1237
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,719
Is just

1238
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:10,303
Reflective of the factors might be great use cases but they're only relevant

1239
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,351
Whereas

1240
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,375
Monitoring

1241
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
Environment

1242
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,959
Spencer's is something very broadly

1243
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,751
Across a whole bunch of

1244
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,543
Industries and use cases

1245
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,847
All right so getting back to

1246
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,943
Adoption in how people are scaling up

1247
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,503
From Pilot tip reproduction reproduction

1248
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,831
You know when I talk to people who are looking at

1249
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,135
This space and building prototype

1250
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,951
They usually start with something like a

1251
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,255
The particle or maybe it's a Raspberry Pi

1252
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:44,095
And then in a certain point like a thousand maybe it's 10,000 there like

1253
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
We need to move some

1254
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,911
To something else

1255
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,471
Talk to me about what you're seeing

1256
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,007
In your customer base

1257
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,031
Because you got this year

1258
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,079
You got the cloud associated with

1259
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,615
So you're basically starting

1260
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,687
With particle and hopefully scaling all the way up

1261
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,711
What is that process

1262
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,063
So a lot of customers

1263
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,855
Start with particle end of skin

1264
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,159
I think the reason is that

1265
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:08,927
The case

1266
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,951
Anacortes Harbor

1267
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:14,559
Business works better we we have a huge Community opportunity

1268
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,375
We make your business

1269
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,399
Israeli Tusa

1270
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,447
Support those companies as they

1271
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,239
Ring products to scale

1272
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,007
So

1273
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,543
I think if you are

1274
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,823
Making the decision

1275
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,591
Prototype

1276
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,663
When you're deciding whether to continue to laptop

1277
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,479
The question is what is the

1278
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:33,759
Strategic

1279
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,319
Or economic reason that you would want to build

1280
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,855
And icing

1281
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:38,879
That

1282
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,159
In a lot of parallel speaker

1283
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,719
Drawn between icing for structure and

1284
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,999
Web infrastructure

1285
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,047
Is essentially about dataset

1286
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,119
Rick 30 years ago if you wanted

1287
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,679
Build-A-Bear application you had to build a data center

1288
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,959
Set up some kind of

1289
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,983
Infrastructure

1290
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,543
And then you're dealing with a lot of heart problems

1291
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
Like

1292
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
Getting

1293
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,871
Real estate and

1294
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,919
Construction

1295
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,967
Temperature

1296
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,759
Controls and replacing servers

1297
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,783
Go bad

1298
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,063
None of which actually makes

1299
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:08,831
Is your project

1300
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,647
Register table Stakes to be able to

1301
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,927
Build a web application

1302
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,511
2006

1303
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,303
Since then

1304
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,327
You got Microsoft

1305
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,095
Google

1306
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:26,239
And overtime or more people have shifted the cloud because essentially there is no good

1307
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,007
Economical

1308
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,055
Versace justification for most

1309
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
Companies

1310
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:30,847
2

1311
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,615
Builder

1312
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,895
America

1313
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,175
Dropbox

1314
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,759
Spent $400 building their own software infrastructure

1315
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,063
Because what they needed to

1316
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,879
To do was easier and more economical for them

1317
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,671
Delivered directly then

1318
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,207
Using AWS

1319
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:47,999
Another really big

1320
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,023
Mastiff

1321
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,839
Netflix

1322
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,119
Hosted on AWS

1323
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:53,887
And so

1324
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,911
There are exception

1325
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,679
Dropbox

1326
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,031
Most of the time even large-scale what applications

1327
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,311
Hotel on the cloud

1328
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,103
Because there isn't a good read

1329
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,895
And I think the same

1330
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:09,247
The same fundamental decisions are true for it infrastructure which is that

1331
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,039
There aren't generally Goods

1332
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:14,879
Strategic Lacoste reasons why somebody should build their own infrastructure

1333
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,159
It doesn't

1334
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:20,767
Make your product better than somebody else's but it's not there isn't good strategic value

1335
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,559
Economically perspective in life

1336
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,887
Get cheaper on a unit basis but if you include all the overhead net

1337
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:30,751
Saria's managing overseeing the infrastructure in Bluetooth devices

1338
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,311
And so what you're left with is

1339
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,591
The same reasons that caused

1340
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,639
To be slow to adopt the cloud

1341
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,687
Even though the underlying

1342
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,271
Which is do you trust somebody else

1343
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,551
Infrastructure for the

1344
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:48,415
This product is super important and our job is to

1345
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,951
Prove overtime by

1346
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:54,815
Supporting a lot of customers who are happy and successful game across markets in that trust

1347
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
Betfair

1348
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
And

1349
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,935
For a company that is looking at

1350
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,215
Buying Hardware

1351
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,775
And doing a prototype and then scaling up

1352
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,567
Where do you see

1353
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,103
The challenges

1354
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,127
So

1355
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,407
Your customers who are like

1356
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:13,247
Yeah we run a successful proof-of-concept in

1357
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,527
To roll this out further

1358
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,319
Where do they hit the road bumps

1359
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,367
Some of the biggest challenges

1360
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:21,951
The one counters when your deployment actually product are

1361
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:28,095
Different than what you expected to be when we ask customers about a bunch of different technical challenges and said

1362
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,631
What have you found to be

1363
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,191
The number one

1364
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,751
What is debugging on health advice

1365
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,287
Which is to say

1366
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,567
Let's say you have a

1367
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:38,847
100000

1368
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,639
But you could collapse

1369
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,687
And generally speaking

1370
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,991
But there's like a thousand

1371
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,063
That are misbehaving

1372
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
Why are they

1373
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,159
Frank cell Princeton samite

1374
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:55,743
The having issues connecting to whatever this other Tower is

1375
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,047
They might

1376
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,863
Tennis shoes where they're not getting

1377
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,983
The necessary 3.3 volts to be able to for the system to be able to

1378
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
To behave

1379
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
Lively

1380
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,799
Daylight

1381
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,335
Something wrong

1382
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,359
Haystak so this

1383
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,127
Secureconnect

1384
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,919
In between the Bison

1385
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:18,271
If you experience you have is just at 99

1386
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,551
Onager devices are

1387
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,831
Sending messages but one

1388
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:26,975
It can be really difficult to figure out why they're not write any one of those problems could be the problem

1389
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,511
Device is out in the world

1390
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,071
Hearing from it can be really tough to figure out what's going

1391
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,863
We've been building a bunch

1392
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,911
Features around

1393
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,447
Which is providing more

1394
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,215
Or inside

1395
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:42,591
To our customers about when you have a device been going to see what exactly is going on and what you do about it

1396
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:48,991
Those are the kinds of challenges when we talked to companies who have delivered product that they say this is a really high

1397
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,271
Start stopwatch

1398
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
Before they deliver

1399
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,367
That one might not be

1400
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,183
The number to Forest in terms of

1401
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,743
What we hear is is most challenging in the

1402
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,279
We don't suffer.

1403
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
Speakeasy

1404
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,327
Children's Opera

1405
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,863
Reprogramming devices

1406
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,631
Remotely

1407
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,911
Create a lot of opportunities

1408
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
4

1409
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,447
Security risk

1410
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,471
Or

1411
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,495
Listening devices

1412
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,031
Way too many

1413
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:16,895
Public cases of devices that got ripped through an over-the-air software update that went bad

1414
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:23,551
And so is another of these big technical challenges that we solve for customers to say we've we've tried to take

1415
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,319
Artist

1416
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,087
Senate results

1417
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,135
Are you there other problems which

1418
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:30,463
I think they're often for them it is difficult but if you ask

1419
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,231
Customers

1420
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:36,607
What we found in the survey is they weren't they weren't as challenging

1421
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,911
Storing and collecting data

1422
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,191
Visualizing

1423
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:40,959
Data

1424
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,007
Generating insights with data

1425
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,543
We generally found the cusp

1426
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,127
And I think that's in contrast to of the

1427
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:52,223
Something like 450 iot platforms that exist in the world

1428
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,295
100

1429
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,319
Analytics

1430
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,879
Find as if those are actually the hardest problem

1431
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,439
The reason for that is the date

1432
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,999
Not hard it's just because there's a lot of great product that already

1433
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,023
Best about

1434
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,071
Solving problems with data that are relevant

1435
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:11,679
I see you don't necessarily need like a specialist it products to go and solve those problems

1436
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:13,983
The one that

1437
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,543
We heard as most challenging the generating insights

1438
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,591
Which is to say not just collecting

1439
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,151
But I kept turning that in

1440
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,943
Into a solution to a problem

1441
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,479
Generally true

1442
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:27,551
Super any business with larger quantities of data is

1443
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,111
Another thing to actually

1444
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,647
Problem

1445
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,463
You see the same challenges than

1446
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,511
Like every marketing product ever

1447
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,815
Babe like you get all this clickbait

1448
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
What you doing on the website

1449
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,631
Turning that into

1450
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,423
Something to go do

1451
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,447
Is the hard part

1452
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,751
A bear in there

1453
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:49,311
Companies that have been successful in helping generate those insights

1454
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,103
But yeah I mean one of the things that I found

1455
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:56,735
I'm looking at these survey results is that some of the things that are often painted as being the hardest problem

1456
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:03,135
Don't actually seem to be that way and the hardest problems really tend to be more about this like nitty-gritty infrastructure

1457
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,927
Sure of fundamentally how do you

1458
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,207
Reliably connected

1459
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,511
100000 physical devices

1460
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,279
To the web

1461
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,583
So that you can regularly communicate back

1462
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,167
Zach thanks so much for

1463
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,447
For coming on the show this week

1464
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,471
I really appreciate

1465
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,311
Absolutely thin grabbing me

1466
