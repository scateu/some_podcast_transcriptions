1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,280
Hey everybody

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:03,584
Welcome back to the second

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,888
Iot podcast

4
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,424
Stacey Higginbotham

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,192
And

6
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,728
And Kevin tofel

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,776
Hey we're getting better at that Kevin

8
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,080
I practice my name for a whole week

9
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,616
Excellent

10
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,432
And this time we have we have video on so I could have

11
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,712
Point to you and be like

12
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,784
That's right read the cue cards

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,552
There we go

14
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,368
Alright so we'll start off this week with

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,672
Okay I'm just going to be self-aggrandizing

16
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,256
Do it I know where you're going to you're going to Nightline aren't you

17
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,072
Can I talk about it

18
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,608
Stacy

19
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:41,472
You were awesome on Nightline for those who did not see it you must go see this segment

20
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,032
It had to be at least I don't know 7 or 8 minutes

21
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,592
I mean I know that your house you told me like 4 hours

22
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,688
9 hours that was distilled into how many minutes

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:55,040
I didn't count so

24
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:55,808
Like

25
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,856
It was like the segments on a run

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,416
And I was like

27
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,744
You're right there nuclear nonproliferation.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,304
Stacy Stacy Smart Home

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
Awesome

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,144
Prom proposals with afterwards I thought I was going to

31
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,704
Proxibid

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,264
Yeah I think prom proposals wins that one but

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,104
It was awesome I watched it two times I thought it was great you showed off

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,944
A lot of the gadgets that you have in your house many we talked about on

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
Pryor podcast before

36
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
There was I know I know Nightline wanted to take an angle of hey how safe and secure is this so they had this this hacker guy is

37
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
Well on the segment was trying to get into your

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,232
Home netwerks who never did which

39
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
Kudos to you for that

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,400
But eventually I think you let him into the network just to do some demonstration things and

41
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
He scared the bejesus out of you turning your blender on right in the middle of you and the in the house talking in Iowa

42
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,104
Laugh my tail off for that that was hysterical

43
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
The not so funny part was

44
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,736
When he had access he was able to unlock your one of your doors

45
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
What was kind of underplayed

46
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
In the

47
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,904
The segment in this was actually I should

48
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,952
Make it clear this was actually shot back in

49
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,000
In January so this was shot in January

50
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
May 12th

51
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
So not even a week after I got back

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
And

53
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,680
What happened was Nightline to contact

54
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,496
And asked me to set everything up on the wink hub

55
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,544
Because the wink Hub have a known folder

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
Mobility

57
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592
That they can take advantage

58
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,408
So I actually dismantle

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
My

60
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Set up

61
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
And put everything

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,088
And they they specifically wanted

63
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,368
Get on a version of the Wings

64
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,416
Actually hadn't been patched yet

65
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,488
So folks this is how your TV sausage

66
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
Scary

67
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,584
And they had the hacker come in

68
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
And he

69
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
To get into my Wi-Fi

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
He drove around

71
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
The handshake

72
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Show

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
In the plan was that they would get the handshake

74
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
I would run it through

75
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
Get basically

76
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
Accessed

77
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
My password

78
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
Code cracking

79
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,880
So they've got a Super Cub

80
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,648
Cheaters attack you

81
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
That they were like

82
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
We're going to try to get

83
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,840
That's not so stupid after all was it actually had

84
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,888
They have legitimate clients that are not

85
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,728
So those clients also had a job running

86
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,776
That took up a lot of data

87
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
So

88
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,152
My my password my Wi-Fi password is

89
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
Longer than password

90
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
1 2 3 4

91
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
It contains you know

92
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368
Different

93
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
Characters letters

94
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
Isn't that sort of

95
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
Special character

96
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,000
Iot podcast with a capital p

97
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
There you go

98
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,120
Guess that you cracked my code who needed supercomputing

99
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,912
So yeah so

100
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
Basically

101
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,752
My guess is they didn't have a lot of

102
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
They just have several

103
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Whatever

104
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
Maybe they had the equivalent of 2

105
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
Do Smartphones work

106
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
And I'd given them

107
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
So I basic

108
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
Sickly

109
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
Typed in my

110
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
But it was still very creepy

111
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
Sitting there

112
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,720
You know looking at his little interface where he was like

113
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Look

114
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
And watching things go up and down

115
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
End

116
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Hello

117
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,399
It was very uncomfortable

118
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,519
In actually until it aired I didn't realize that he never got my

119
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
And a mirror at the hacker lives in Austin

120
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
So I was like

121
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,455
2 there's this guy in Austin who may or may not know my password

122
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
I should probably change that

123
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
And this is the issue

124
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,087
Because I have so many Wi-Fi

125
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
Connected devices

126
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,927
Do I really need to change my password

127
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,023
Well yeah I mean you think about it

128
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,607
Not right now maybe in your case yes but for everyone else

129
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
As we adopt a Smart Homes

130
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:59,775
And we have all these devices more more devices in the coming years connected to the Wi-Fi network

131
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,335
And we change the password that's it that's a hassle

132
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
Yeah the nest

133
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:10,015
When you have your Wi-Fi password on an S that is in click wheel is like putting your password in with a rotary phone it's

134
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,855
Okay so the learning experience

135
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
From

136
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
Nightline

137
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,463
Other than TV shows are not exact

138
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
As they appear

139
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
On TV

140
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
We already knew

141
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,095
Was that

142
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
You know your house

143
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
Is vulnerable and

144
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
I actually have as my guests on this way

145
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
Sweet show

146
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,079
Josh Korman who is from I am the cowboy

147
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,127
Cavalry

148
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Which is a

149
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,455
Security organization working to talk in more depth about that

150
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
Soon but

151
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
You know I just

152
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,575
As we're putting these things in guys

153
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
It is really important to think about

154
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
Setting a password

155
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
On your Wi-Fi account

156
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,047
Also to make sure that the devices you buy

157
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
Research them beforehand

158
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
And make sure that they are sick

159
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,191
Secure in that could be as simple as

160
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
Looking up

161
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
Wink hub

162
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
Secure

163
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Or

164
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
Kwikset door lock

165
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Secure

166
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,431
And then keeping your firmware up to date

167
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:15,039
I was just going to say that I don't know about you but I tend to set my devices up

168
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:20,159
For auto detection of new firmware updates and Auto download and even Auto install if I can

169
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:26,559
I know that could actually introduce a problem as opposed to help solve the problem but I feel a little bit safer knowing I do

170
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
Don't need to maintain the stuff

171
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
You know every single day

172
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,447
That's actually a really good

173
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Best practice

174
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
Especially

175
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
Especially with the

176
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,823
Smart home because some of these things

177
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
Can actually come on

178
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
It update when you're not

179
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
Write about using cuz

180
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
There is nothing more frustrating than b

181
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,783
Haven to turn on my lights

182
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319
No you're not

183
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
The firmware update

184
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
I just need a light

185
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
I don't need firmware

186
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,559
I can't read my book because my firmware is out of date

187
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Exactly

188
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,167
I'm trying to show my friends my really awesome lights

189
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
And they're like

190
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Yeah this is

191
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,287
Are my house I just flipped a switch

192
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
Speaking of life

193
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,991
Oh here we go good Segway

194
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,855
So I got in the mail

195
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Just blast

196
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
Brand new light

197
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
And I know I'm not supposed

198
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743
What to talk about lights but it's brand-new you guys

199
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
So I'm going to do it

200
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
This is the

201
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
Go

202
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Two words

203
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Hugo

204
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
I named my Hugo

205
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
Hugo

206
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
I'm so

207
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
So predict

208
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
So this is

209
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
A

210
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
This is a hue light

211
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895
That fits in

212
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
The palm of both of you

213
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
So it's a bowl

214
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,831
It's a boy it's a bowl it's a translucent bowl with a light in it

215
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,647
It's about 6 in in diameter at the top

216
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
And it is

217
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Beautiful

218
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,303
And you can take it places

219
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
It does everything a hue light does

220
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
It changes colors

221
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
It dims

222
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
It's connected via the app

223
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
So it can work with other lighting rest

224
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Recipes

225
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
It's kind of like

226
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
The same shape is

227
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Friends of hue

228
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
Too late if you guys are

229
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Familiar with those

230
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
So it can rest flat on the ground and

231
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
Like the bowl like

232
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
Or you can tilt it

233
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
And it's got a little stand that you

234
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
Tilted up and then you

235
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Shine it up with

236
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Against the wall

237
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
So if you have like a boring white wall

238
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
You could actually turn the light

239
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,399
You can highlight nice artwork you have on a wall

240
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:43,775
There's all kinds of things you can do what makes this interesting is that it's completely wireless and I don't mean just from

241
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,591
Being I am assuming it's wifi-connected it is

242
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Like all Hue Lights

243
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
Is it be connected

244
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
Got

245
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
It

246
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
Connect via the Hub

247
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,295
Your Wi-Fi Hub

248
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
It connects

249
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
To EUR

250
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
Wi-Fi networks at the house

251
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
Right but the other

252
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:06,047
Pardes from a power standpoint it is Wireless as well as a rechargeable battery inside

253
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,143
So you can literally take this little light bowl anywhere you want

254
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,031
Put it on a nightstand in the kids room put it like I said you up against the wall to show artwork and so on

255
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,383
You can if you're doing work in the garage and utility light maybe you can use it for that

256
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
You can go anywhere

257
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:26,271
However I asked AC before the show how long does that battery last

258
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
Go ahead

259
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,903
Philip says it guarantees 3 hours off its base

260
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,743
I had it on for about four and a half hours

261
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
And it was doing

262
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Just fine

263
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
And because it's an LED

264
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
It doesn't

265
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
Dim it just

266
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
It's on

267
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
Tree binary

268
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,567
And you know I would also say like this light

269
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
Sense8

270
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
Came and we turned it on and plugged

271
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
And it has not been

272
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
In my head

273
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
My daughter has been using it is

274
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Is a prop in

275
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Just about every

276
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
It's been a crystal ball she

277
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
She stuck it in the bottom of

278
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Cauldron

279
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
Animated witches brew

280
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,975
So I can see this coming in really handy Act

281
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,631
I think I think there is a target audience in kids there because it looks simple-to-use

282
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:20,031
If you can control it through the smartphone app that you were showing me before the show there's even a button on it that you can change the color of the light

283
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:27,199
Right off the bat and my kids were getting when they were younger they were getting these colored light bulbs to put a mood in their room but now

284
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,807
Now something like this on the kids nightstands or they can play to their hearts content

285
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,111
I could see a big a big audience there

286
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,951
Shirley Phillips actually has Partnerships they have these lights that they

287
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
Make with like Disney

288
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,047
Where you can download like a Disney storybook app

289
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,631
That changes the light with the story

290
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,679
The book and it's like a special

291
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,471
Light + storybook thing

292
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,775
With something like this you would just

293
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
Download a story app

294
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
And then

295
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
You just like

296
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
And that's that be really cool like it

297
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
With your bedtime

298
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:07,135
Whole new environment for what what is it little mermaid or here's the question though

299
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,207
I was waiting for it just ask the question

300
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,839
As with all the lightbulbs I always ask this question how much is this one bowl of light

301
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,679
How much would you pay for this wonders bowl of light

302
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,727
Well given the battery life

303
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
I don't know that I would

304
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,079
But but but I would say

305
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,663
I wouldn't surprise me if it was at least $50

306
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
So

307
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,783
Double that it is 99

308
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
95

309
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
What

310
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
Desist Phillips

311
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
These people are.

312
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,695
Expensive

313
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
This is not

314
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
She plastic

315
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:51,679
Expensive expensive plastic

316
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
Paradise beauty

317
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
You would not mind him

318
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:02,175
So I'm wondering what will it cost me to take an Arduino board and an LED light board and make my own for 6

319
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
You wouldn't get the pretty enclosure

320
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,063
I mean this is something I have a very nice

321
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
I mean you see my home on night light

322
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
I would have his sitting in my home

323
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
My home is

324
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,511
Fairly nice I have your own password I'm going to turn on your blender right now

325

Good luck with that the blender is it normal for everyone

328
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,495
Normally I don't have Frozen flute

329

Frozen fruit sitting in my blender waiting to scare the bejesus out of

330
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,711
99 bucks for this thing okay it is expensive

331
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,271

00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
Light bulbs are

365
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
20 bucks a pop

366
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,751
So that's what they're bringing everything down

367
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
He's coming down as more people buy then I can

368
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
Yeah

369
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
So you may not see a lot of

370
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479

371
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
The Hugo Bowl

372
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
Ghetto

373
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
You don't need it

374
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
It's never going to be something

375
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
Can you need I think it's a great

376
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
The sort of stuff

377
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
It is a lot of

378
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
All right

379
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
So

380
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
No Segway here

381
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
I say we just move right into it

382
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
What's next

383
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,543
Last week big news

384
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,591
Yeah Amazon Dash This is

385
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:11,455
It's interesting I'll give Amazon that and it fits within their whole e-commerce

386
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
We want to sell you everything

387
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
Mantra

388
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:19,391
4 people who aren't aware of the dash I think it's by invite only for Prime members right now

389
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,487
And I do not have one I am a Prime member but I haven't requested an invite

390
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,303
These are little sticky buttons basically

391
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
That

392
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
When you press the button

393
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,727
You will actually order something from Amazon and that something is very specific

394
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:38,847
Like on their site to show a picture of the dash button with the Tide logo tide

395
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,895
Laundry detergent which

396
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
We happened to use

397
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,527
A theoretically ever get one of these I would stick the tide dash button on my

398
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
Washing machine

399
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,879
And when I'm running low on type I press the button

400
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
An Amazon

401
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,719
Places the order for more tied to my house

402
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
And Amazon has

403
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
17 Brands already

404
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,167
So some of the brands that they have so far is

405
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
Tide as you mentioned

406
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
They have

407
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
Cottonelle

408
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
Bounce

409
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,663
Kraft macaroni and cheese why didn't I just saw that we were not at all the time

410
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
See you can

411
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,015
You can

412
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,087
And Oil of Olay to oh my goodness I've got everything covered

413
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,159
Yeah your Oil of Olay Beauty bars

414
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
I think this is

415
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,791
So what I saw this I was like

416
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,863
That's weird when a lot of people saw this they thought it was a

417
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
April Fool's Day joke

418
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
They did

419
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
I wish I had I thought

420
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,007
No no this makes total sense people love buttons

421
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,847
And I saw in the New Yorker actually had a really great

422
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Take on this

423
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,711
One of the writers there wrote a store

424
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,039
Hot take about this and they're like

425
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,855
This is basically reducing friction even more

426
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
And

427
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,743
Every time you run out of something you have the choice basically to not buy it at

428
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
Armada switch brands

429
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
So this is great for Amazon

430
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,167
You never run out so you never have to make that choice

431
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Maybe I don't know

432
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
Maybe I should switch

433
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
So by pressing that button your

434
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
You're basically like

435
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Consumerism

436
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,663
Keep going if it's Amazon

437
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,759
You know standard operating procedure and what they're in business for I totally get it

438
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,063
It does reduce friction I could see that

439
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
I

440
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:29,183
Don't think I'll go with any of these even I see some of the products that we use

441
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
I anticipate

442
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,255
Some more

443
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,327
Amazon Smartwatch apps that will

444
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
Let me just speak my order

445
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
You've already got the echo

446
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
So you can see erratically

447
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
Order from

448
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
Your Echo with us I would imagine

449
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:48,639
As opposed to having lots of little button stuck around your house yeah that's the thing cuz all these buttons

450
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
I know

451
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:56,575
I know that they are not making a lot of noise cuz 99.9% of the time they're not doing anything is not until you hit that button that

452
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,879
Any data is going through my home network and whatnot

453
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:04,511
And I didn't look into the technical way you know how these buttons connected to a Wi-Fi network I presume so

454
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
Yeah

455
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:11,679
And I don't I don't know that I want more items on my Wi-Fi network unless I unless they're high value items is what I

456
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
I guess I would want to say

457
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,775
I don't want I look at my Wi-Fi

458
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:22,431
No address table now and there's got to be close to 80 or 90 items on their between tablets and phones and

459
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,015
Xboxes in Connected TVs and iPads and

460
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
Laptops and

461
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,367
I mean I just don't want to clutter that up

462
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:35,743
So you're going to really hate the second part of this so the dash buttons are Amazon's retro

463
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,583
What's really interesting about their announcement

464
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,631
A lot of people didn't focus on beak

465
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Because the buttons are so

466
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
Impressum is the

467
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:50,079
The second half which is the Amazon replenishment service

468
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Part

469
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:55,455
And that is a program and the first devices will be coming out in the fall

470
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,015
But Amazon's got Partnerships with

471
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
Companies like Brita

472
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
Like the Water Filter Company

473
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
Brother printer

474
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Corky

475
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
Which makes all these

476
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
Quirky connected devices

477
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,535
And other products I see what you did there

478
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
And

479
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
Whirlpool even

480
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
To integrate

481
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,983
Basically the capabilities to reorder from am

482
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,543
Into a hardwired button

483
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
I'm inside

484
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
A machine

485
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
So

486
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,407
And you can either have a physical button

487
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Hardwired

488
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,783
Or it is something that automatically detects when you're out

489
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,575
Andre orders like that

490
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
Now that you don't even do it

491
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
But

492
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
They're going to have a device that

493
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,999
Still on your network so Corky's launching

494
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
A pet feeder

495
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
For example

496
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,095
So this is something you stick

497
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,887
Keep or the pet food into the

498
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
Automatic pet

499
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,495
Peter and then suddenly when it's

500
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
Runnin low it's going to be like

501
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
Your Amazon

502
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Pet food for shelter

503
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
At your door you don't do

504
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:01,247
And I like that you know what I'd like the end result it's just the implementation

505
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,903
And it's personal thing is this isn't gonna bother everybody I know that I almost wish they were either Bluetooth or

506
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
60 buttons

507
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,231
That went to a single Hub or switch

508
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
Through my phone to my Amazon account

509
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,351
As opposed to all these individual WiFi devices

510
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:22,239
So you're at your issue is just that it's I mean you could call if your Wi-Fi router the

511
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:27,615
I could call it that but it wouldn't change anything

512
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,407
You're right I could

513
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
But I won't

514
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,271
Okay so so you just don't want it going straight to

515
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
Cloud

516
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,927
Not not that I don't want all these individual WiFi devices

517
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
For for individual items

518
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:49,375
That I might purchase like I'm looking at the 17 items we use bounty we use Clorox wipes I go through Gatorade

519
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
Like you wouldn't believe

520
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:55,263
Tide we go through type mac and cheese come on everybody goes to mac and cheese

521
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,567
It's not the items but think of

522
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:03,455
Do I want a button for every one of these and every one of the buttons is a separate Wi-Fi item on my network

523
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,247
No I don't want that

524
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:10,111
That's really interesting cuz I was thinking by my immediately went to the waist for 10

525
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,159
God what if I

526
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:16,767
On Tuesday I I hit the tide button and then on Wednesday I hit the mac and cheese

527
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,071
And then I'm thinking about like

528
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
All the packaging that comes in

529
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
I'd rather have the

530
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,215
Orders held in aggravated but you're like

531
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
It's very odd to me that you're focused on the device you are saving the planet I'm saving my network

532
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:39,551
What we we do Amy we order from Amazon at least once a week if not

533
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Twice

534
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
We tend to bundle things UPS

535
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,951
For that reason I mean we try not to be frivolous

536
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
With that.

537
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:51,839
You know the the shipping in the packing cuz that is a big part of our life and we do try to stay aware of that

538
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
So

539
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,191
I guess I didn't think that far ahead yet I was just thinking of my own network but

540
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
Yeah I mean

541
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
But I don't want

542
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,079
Packaging and FedEx or UPS here everyday just to

543
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,919
Bring me something I can actually go down the street in a mile and a half and go get anyway so

544
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,039
Okay will close out the episode now that we've

545
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,647
We each had our own like weird issues with the dash

546
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,696
I still kind of excited about it I

547
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,256
I've applied so I'm hopeful that I will

548
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
A dash

549
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
Submit a recommendation let me know

550
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,424
Faces thank you

551
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Stay tuned because our guest is going to talk about

552
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,056
Security and we're going to spend a lot of times actually

553
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
On cars

554
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
I'm in he's going to cut it

555
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,664
Scare you scare you a little bit

556
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
But there's hope

557
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,504
So I'm going to go get some mac and cheese and then TuneIn

558
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,064
There you go get your Mac and Cheese get it already

559
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
And stay tuned for Josh

560
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
Korman who is

561
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,208
Is a founder of I am the cavalry

562
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,448
Hey everybody we are back with the Internet of Things podcast and I have with me

563
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:04,544
Josh Korman who is a founder of I am the cavalry

564
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
. org

565
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,384
And he is also the CTO of sonatype

566
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,176
Hey Josh how you doing today

567
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
I'm doing well

568
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,784
All right well I Ask Josh here because

569
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,320
I am the calvary

570
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
Is a

571
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:24,512
Security type organization and I say security type organization which is so vague because I'm going to have him tell you a little bit more about it

572
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,048
Sure

573
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,704
We started I am the Cavalry official launch was at Defcon 21 so largest hacker conference in the world which is

574
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
August of 2013

575
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,056
And it came from some of the

576
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,640
The members of the security community that had noticed that our

577
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:47,040
Our basic problem statement that unified us was that our dependence on connected technology was growing a lot faster than

578
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
Our ability to secure it

579
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:54,464
And while many of us got in a hacking culture as a hobby we weren't paying attention it became our profession

580
00:22:54,976 --> 00:23:01,120
But we noticed over the last five years is that once again weren't paying attention and now software and vulnerable software was

581
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,448
Is going into our cars are medical devices are homes

582
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,240
Our critical infrastructure

583
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,568
And wow 80 billion dollars is spent a year to protect

584
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:14,432
Credit cards and it's an abject failure I mean most of us have had a credit card compromised

585
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,296
The failure rate for the merchants for example or Enterprise security is nearly 100%

586
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,112
And what we said is we're now putting up

587
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,232
Marble connected technology into things that affect our families are Public Safety in human life

588
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
So few of us quietly

589
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:36,448
Work used our careers and our credibility to get it high and deep as we could in the government and intelligence community

590
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,104
Internationally domestically and what we found is we we naively believed that if you got his hind if you can get and get the right

591
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,176
Message the right stakeholders they would quote-unquote fix it

592
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
But after doing so

593
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,760
It was obvious that

594
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
Even they weren't

595
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,600
Informed are empowered enough to do anything

596
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,440
And it was so boring and what we said to ourselves as you know the Cavalry isn't coming

597
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,976
No one's going to come save us

598
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,280
And this is simultaneously

599
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,352
Destroy your confidence but also is empowering

600
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,656
Because it says what they

601
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,704
Can't do it it falls to us to try

602
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:15,360
I am the Cavalry was really a personal declaration that I can Scream the darkness or I can be a part of the

603
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
Absolution

604
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:21,504
Emily challenge the hacker Community to do to a Grassroots non-profit

605
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,784
Renovation was

606
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:29,696
Let's be a voice of reason and Technical literacy and let's fix the the education in the public in the

607
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,256
Public policy makers in the affected Industries

608
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:36,608
Because in a real knowledge Gap and if we can beat at ambassador

609
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,888
That we can help

610
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,192
Speak to them in their terms and elevate

611
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,496
During staining them will make smarter choices

612
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,824
We're not against technology when I'm saying smash all your iot

613
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:52,480
But what we see is that where we place dependence on this connected technology and we want to ensure that's worthy of our trust in at the moment is now

614
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,296
Okay so you've told me

615
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,624
The basically what we're doing we're putting computers in places where there

616
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,440
Have not been computers before and so

617
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,280
Software you told me makes the things vulnerable and connecting it to the internet

618
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
Makes it exposed

619
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
So

620
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
Kind of given that

621
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,472
You started this organization and you said that there are four seas to your

622
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
What are those forces

623
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,592
It's collecting connecting collaborating catalyzing

624
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,664
And it's not just something we say it's it's how our

625
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,736
Approaching this this value in this Mission so we collect

626
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,856
Existing research and researchers so we don't have to reinvent the wheel there's a large body of work

627
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
That has been done

628
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,976
By solo artists but we believe it to be stronger if we collect them

629
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
We connect them to each other

630
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,120
For the first time in a long time turns out there's quite a few car hackers for example

631
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:47,264
I will also connect them with willing teammates in the automotive industry or medical device for example

632
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,080
We try to cause some form of

633
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:54,176
Working groups in collaboration whether it's for an individual company

634
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,224
Or whether it's an industry initiative

635
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
And we try to catalyze

636
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:02,880
Action that would not have happened otherwise I would not have happened as soon had we not tried

637
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:09,792
And what we don't want to do is simply admire or describe the problem what we want to do is cause safer out

638
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Come sooner

639
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,352
And those four seas

640
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,656
I've been pretty successful

641
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,704
I'm primarily in the automotive

642
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,520
And the medical device product is hot on a scale

643
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,056
Okay so

644
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,336
You guys have been doing this

645
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,872
For about 20 months

646
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
And

647
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:31,296
It obviously Detroit has been one of your kind of Automotive space has been really good for y'all so far

648
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,088
In those 20 months

649
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
What have you

650
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Done

651
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,000
So we're taking a Long View on this and we know that some of this is building Trust

652
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
So

653
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,304
We're not going to see

654
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,632
Super awesome immediate results we have seen a few

655
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,936
I was talking about the first nine months

656
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,240
Signing those willing allies and teammates

657
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:55,872
Are first birthday we published an open letter to the car CEOs through writers

658
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:02,784
And with it we published at Five Star Automotive cyber-safety framework or we basically said look you guys have been making

659
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,600
Safety improvements over the last 50 years India

660
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,416
Actually care about driving safety into your products

661
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
Are your Masters at your domain

662
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
We are masters of our domain

663
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
And now that our demands are cloudy

664
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,608
Collider Bergen of the safest outcomes is soonest if we work together

665
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,192
This framework of five foundational capabilities

666
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:25,056
Because if a car is now computer on Wheels there in in Harry a lot of the

667
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:31,456
Similar adversaries attack services but the difference being that the consequences of failure far more severe

668
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
So that begin

669
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,552
The more overt public

670
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,600
Collaboration right behind the scenes weed help

671
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,904
People with their structure design

672
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,696
You saw

673
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:48,096
Fruits of Labor such as that the Tesla car company published according disclosure policy saying it would not see third-party res

674
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,656
Researchers that was amazing staff that we're hoping

675
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,216
Bothering others in industry emulate

676
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:57,056
But let's talk about your framework before we get to the Tesla stuff because

677
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
That actually follows

678
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
Some of your framework

679
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,968
We got to we got to tell people what it is before they get all excited about it

680
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,904
So you know actually put this in a tweet once but the more verbose version is on the site but the idea is we think it's a

681
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,952
Forgiving the all systems fail

682
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,536
I think anyone with any sort of engineering background knows this intrinsically

683
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
So giving it all systems fail is not an issue

684
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,376
Cars will be hacked it's

685
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,424
That when they are

686
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,728
Whether it's three accidents are adversaries

687
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,032
We want to have it ready posture

688
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,336
So these five are foundational

689
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:35,456
Activities and capabilities that any should have some when I put them in a tweet it said how do you

690
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,992
Avoid failure

691
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,088
Take help avoiding failure learn from failure respond to failure and isolate failure

692
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
But that the five

693
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,184
Verbosely on the site or do you have a published

694
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:51,840
Attestation of high do safety by Design so what steps are you taking much like Microsoft does with their famous STL

695
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,680
To keep your customers safe when they're cyber cyber physical system

696
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,800
Number two says look when I miss stuff so you won't engage willing allies acting in good faith

697
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,336
And we therefore have a

698
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,920
Policy saying we will not Sue third-party researchers who report

699
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:11,808
Bugs to us in a predictable way and there's two ISO standards already on how to do coordinates closure

700
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:18,208
They don't have to reinvent the wheel they're the third one's pretty darn important it's think of it like tamper-evident frantically sound evidence

701
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,256
Capture like a black box in an airplane

702
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,584
Will a car companies simultaneously crying that there were

703
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,888
There was no evidence of of hacking

704
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:31,264
In the field and yet none of them that were making that claim had any ability to notice if they had ever been hacked

705
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:37,664
So at least the foundation capacity we should be able to see tamper evidence and have it be Court admissible evidence

706
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:44,064
So we can start to learn in the Auto industry much like we do every time a plane crash it really critical one that a couple companies

707
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
Have other ones are elected to do

708
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,928
Is the respondent failure and that's really do you have secure updates

709
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:55,328
Now you lead us to be over the air and Tesla provides this and I think you can save some of the recent BMW compromised

710
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,984
I'd actually fixed the Bonneville software over the air before they even announced their customers that they were honorable so that things

711
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,384
Example of a response in days or weeks as opposed to months or years which may be the case he requires a physical

712
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
Recall

713
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,480
Any isolate failures at CIA

714
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,552
Tell us how you separate critical from non-critical systems

715
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:20,160
Right now for example there's so much flat conductivity in the vehicles that

716
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,000
It's possible that a compromise of the radio or the infotainment system

717
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:30,656
Could turn the steering wheel or disable brakes and what we want to do is separate critical or non-critical systems either with logical or physical

718
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Isolation

719
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:36,032
I so that when the inevitable compromise happens

720
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:42,432
The full reach of the damage is contained and we don't think of this is like a PCI checklist of if I do these things I'm done

721
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:48,064
Adidas foundational table states that when you add connected technology to things that can kill people

722
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,856
These are the must-haves and where

723
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:54,720
Aggressively trying to cause he's that become table stakes in an automotive Medical

724
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,744
And other areas

725
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,816
So these are the bare minimum so you should start here

726
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,608
And then from there

727
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,680
You like everybody's designing from the same space

728
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,752
And then from there is where you start building on kind of

729
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:12,640
Damn you think about it we're taking all the attack surface from software

730
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,176
And Enterprise computing

731
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:18,272
You know some of the vehicles were vulnerable the same in some of the same open source

732
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,576
Flies that like are played right if

733
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,624
You're going to use something that's

734
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:28,768
Going to give you functionality from the private sector from other use cases and it's going to get compromised

735
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,424
En masse in the public and you lack the ability to do anything updated you got the attack surface but you don't have

736
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,264
The copper bowl Windows update or or Mac OS update

737
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,360
So with this dependence on digital infrastructure comes

738
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:48,480
Another responsibility to to maintain it and have a prompt and I'd life cycle like

739
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
Anything else

740
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,832
When he different so is you have to look at credit cards

741
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:59,232
Is an acceptable fraud rate annually in as long as that industry stays within that acceptable fraud rate whether it's 4%

742
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
Or whatnot

743
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:05,888
Then you're okay if I asked you to Stacy what's an acceptable failure rate for your family's safety

744
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,704
I guess it depends on the system I mean like

745
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,728
My brakes

746
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
Gosh

747
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
Nothing

748
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
Brighton

749
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,360
Isn't my maps or GPS

750
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,408
You know

751
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,992
For me probably it's pretty high cuz it's not like I know where I'm going anyway but

752
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,552
Well I mean

753
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:29,952
Fair enough but I think that's one reason for these 5 being necessary because right now perhaps a compromise of an a

754
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:35,840
A Pandora app store or your GPS may seem benign but can be a pivot point to your brakes

755
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,864
And your steering

756
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,912
You were recently in Detroit and

757
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:43,776
Tell me a little bit about that so so far what is the industry kind of response been to

758
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
This

759
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:45,824
Primark

760
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:52,736
Well you know they're very new to this issue so they're going it's almost like Microsoft from 15-20 years ago they're afraid

761
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,040
Play the share they're afraid to talk about what they're doing

762
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:00,160
Right now the narrative is controlled by the public hacking on the news and The Sensational headlines

763
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Joe

764
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:07,328
Many of them are pretty good things but none of them were talking about it so it's a very one-sided narrative I think in

765
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
One week you had 6 minutes

766
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:12,704
I was at the time I was like the BMW hack was announced

767
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,336
NBA she wrote analysis why that was a success story and how they were embracing at least some of the framework

768
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,920
And the BMW Hack That was was that over the OBD port

769
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:28,576
Now this was they had something like an OnStar system that allowed you to maybe call and say hey my

770
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,624
I locked myself out of my car can you let me in

771
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
And

772
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,488
Some researchers found the ability to compromise that

773
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
So

774
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,608
In the process of accepting that third-party collaboration without sending them

775
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:44,960
They work behind the scenes they shouldn't over the air update before they told him was broken

776
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:50,080
And in the process of doing so they also realize that they're over there update mechanism was passing

777
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,176
Things in the clear so they also migrated to using http

778
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,528
To me it's like these guys are already dependent on kinetic technology

779
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:04,928
And we want to do is put them on a path for that virtuous upward spiral and that learning and continuous improvement process

780
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,512
So while we are a bit mortified at some of the failures that

781
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,816
Allowed under the compromise to happen

782
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:16,704
We are really pleased at how elegant the response was they use it as an opportunity to bring themselves but also

783
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,032
By disclosing some of those details in ways they didn't have to

784
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,080
They also let the industry get a little smarter

785
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,128
So you know that happen.

786
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:27,712
A few days later the 60 Minutes piece showing DARPA

787
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,736
Attacking

788
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:32,064
Cars without physical contact is that the one that cliches is that

789
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,648
What always requires physical access they did it without physical access

790
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:42,304
Myself and I Craig Smith Grand open garages we did one on NBC New York Road that the journalist

791
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
Was manipulating a vehicle from New York

792
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
30 Rock

793
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,448
All the way to Seattle so 3000 miles away

794
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,728
They're not manipulation

795
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,104
Alexandra markina Massachusetts announced his in his report for hacking and tracking

796
00:34:55,872 --> 00:35:02,016
Which took a year-long investigation into the state of security for the automotive industry Street in a lot of heat and light at the same time

797
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Time

798
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,624
Any parallel we've been trying to build trust relationships with the

799
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,720
Groups like the software Society of Automotive Engineers SAE

800
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:15,584
We're just paying their working groups I've done things with Department of Homeland Security in DHS for connected

801
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,888
Cyber vehicle for the government

802
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,448
Solis worth it worth trying to harmonize on

803
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,728
Instead of

804
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:28,128
A bunch of private Solutions everyone seems to be talking about this five-star is the lowest common denominator or Lisa

805
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Some sort of

806
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,992
Common Ground everyone could could strive to implement

807
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,552
No cars are designed

808
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,088
Sometimes five years out

809
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,136
Some of the technologies that goes into

810
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,672
And so

811
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:46,560
When realistically am I going to see a safer vehicle on the road how much is this is going to be

812
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,608
Implemented in time

813
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,936
Well it's a unevenly distributed right

814
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
It's a

815
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:59,360
Some of the vehicles already have over the air updates some of them was Tesla alluded to earlier they have a pump

816
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
List Cornell

817
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,664
Disclosure policy so

818
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,272
Researchers are encouraged to find a random issues which is going to make them smarter and safer sooner

819
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:11,648
Other car companies have a lot of stuff in the works but yeah you're absolutely right I asked a simple question

820
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:15,232
There's a scenario that many of the people in history have known about for years which is

821
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:19,328
That the remote kill switch allows you to remotely disable stolen vehicle

822
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,632
Honest used in different ways different countries

823
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,704
And a lot of them are implemented in securely

824
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,496
And I can't be patched or updated

825
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:31,616
So I said look at it we're just kind of all waiting with his Sword of Damocles like who's going to

826
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,944
Disable a fleet of vehicles or emergency response vehicles

827
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,736
Or gridlock a city

828
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:42,880
Yeah this is going to have a crisis of confidence in the consumer population if they no longer trust their cars so

829
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
Let's say that you you get hacked

830
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:50,304
It's your company this is a back in November I asked about eight of them were sitting around having coffee during the breaks

831
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:54,656
And they were competitors and I said so if yours is hacked tomorrow and you're on the news

832
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:58,496
What's a stop you from being the next BP oil spill that just gushing

833
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,544
And gushing for days and weeks

834
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,640
And none of them really had a good answer so I can let me phrase it this way

835
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
If yours was hacked tomorrow

836
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,760
And you're on the news tomorrow what's your minimum

837
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,576
Response time best casement and response time

838
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,368
Andeavor crickets

839
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
When you can hear a pin drop

840
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:22,816
And one of them said all right I'll go first let's just face it in 2018 models are already done his best first answer

841
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,120
2018 models are already done

842
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,144
Notice there was no

843
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,448
Something that they could do it over the air update

844
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,592
And then somebody else said yeah it's actually worse than that cuz they're a third-party supply chain is done through 20/20 on cases

845
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:39,456
So you're talkin multiple-year response time if something is serious is

846
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:43,040
Kill sweatshirt brakes being shut off on mass were to happen tomorrow

847
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,880
Do we already have the weakness the question is are we ready

848
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,928
To respond that failure

849
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,816
And all the sudden it dawned on them that okay wait you're not trying to post something on us it's actually really good

850
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:02,240
If we can have a problem as a response to keys out of headlines not a material impact or stock price we're not the next embarrassing beep

851
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
Coil spill

852
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,544
One of actually pointed out

853
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,640
You guys a lot less stigma on a software update in Arizona Factory

854
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
Recall

855
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,480
So I'm a little dismayed the fact that you know

856
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,760
20/20

857
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
Still

858
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,856
5 years out and some automakers

859
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,928
Are not able even if they wanted to to adapt

860
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,720
Components of fitness

861
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
So

862
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,096
Yikes, take this framework cuz you've mentioned medical devices which

863
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,376
Also important

864
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,936
Are they a little farther along

865
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:37,312
You know what the reason is sliced up these products the way we did is each have a different cohort of manufacturers

866
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:43,456
They each have a different time to live for the technology so you know industrial controls Queens 30 years and cell phone that's too

867
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,784
They also have different government

868
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,856
Regulatory Frameworks in data structures so

869
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:56,512
You know I look at the FDA the Food Drug Administration for medical devices and there isn't a lot of guidance or enforcement yet

870
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,352
And it looks like an intractable problems on the reasons we lean towards car first

871
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:06,752
But that's Edward we are finding different ways to catalyze growth are we looking bump purchasers like you know

872
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:11,616
The Mayo Clinic is a fairly large influencer purchasers in evaluation so

873
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:17,504
You know how the Mayo Clinic steers its its criteria has asymmetric impact on industry

874
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,808
I'm looking at legislative

875
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,464
I'm an executive branch options for medical so they all have their different challenges but we're very focused

876
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,096
Start identifying that chain of influence and just like good white hat hackers were fussing the chain of influence and we're trying what works

877
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
Per industry

878
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,472
Diversity Automotive guys had a bigger Head Start without being required to

879
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,032
We think that free market forces

880
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,104
Are promising there with medical it's going to be

881
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,920
A disruptive that ecosystem

882
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,224
But we're focusing on what's reasonable on your

883
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,016
You should see a five-star

884
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:54,368
Medical save cyber-safety Frameworks suing that was very very similar because we think these

885
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,904
Abstract capabilities

886
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
Evergreen

887
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,744
And good for all four projects

888
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,816
Okay and what about the Smart Home

889
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,912
So smartphones tougher in some ways because

890
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:13,568
You know it's one thing to get like GM and Tesla a Nissan and Toyota to kind of changes only so many players

891
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:20,992
The internet of everything right it's a whole Debbie of these Indiegogo Kickstarter size company

892
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,064
Now I do feel that people like Sony in

893
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
You know

894
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,624
Kenmore and dularge

895
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,184
Iot manufacturers are more likely

896
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,768
To look like the response received from the automotive industry

897
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,072
But I also think

898
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:41,216
It's going to be a lot harder because there's different economics for these very very small devices with a very short time to live

899
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,544
So it's in some ways a much harder problem

900
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,384
But that's why groups like build it securely or Blitz. ILY

901
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,176
I'm happily

902
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:56,320
Specifically focused on that one's they can give a good reference architectures and good things to consider for anyone developing these

903
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:01,440
And some folks are donating their services to these Inigo Indiegogo Kickstarter sized innovators

904
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:07,072
It's hard to tell who the next nest is going to be but if Nest doesn't get it operational security model correct for example

905
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:11,424
You asking to have a very large impact on the future

906
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,704
Wechat platform

907
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,728
And I

908
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:20,128
And I said I think our tactic there has been let's find the highest leverage watering holes whether it's the hardware platform

909
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:23,456
Azure the development environments or the groups

910
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,784
That people flock to you when they're designing developing these

911
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,600
But that you know I looked at your excellent

912
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,672
Television spot on your connected home

913
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,488
And most of those were benign if they

914
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,352
Compromise you but I am concerned that most of the Bluetooth door locks or

915
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,424
Are about security systems have been compromised I think

916
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,496
Leprechaun my co-founder both when he was at

917
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,568
Trustwave running spiderlabs in his new role

918
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:53,151
His oenis friends tested most of the Home Security

919
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:58,015
Technology stock I don't think it's not a single one that they couldn't easily compromised so

920
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,039
The batting averages

921
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,319
Incredibly low

922
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:06,207
And if you think about it we buy these Technologies to keep a people out of our homes and they may be the very thing that lets got people in their homes and

923
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,279
And that's the life in my physical safety type stuff

924
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,631
This is this is something and maybe this a good place to leave

925
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,911
On I don't know

926
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:18,239
I feel like most people when they buy these things

927
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,519
They buy them too

928
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,823
Not necessarily keep people out of their home like

929
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,615
If I'm buying a

930
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
A Bluetooth door lock I am

931
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
Less interested in

932
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:33,343
I mean I'm interested in locking my door but a door lock can be compromised whether or not it's connect

933
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,719
You're not right it's actually much easier to break into my house via just just smashing the window then

934
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:44,607
Packing my door lock right but the connected door lock gives me a lot more information and even a connected

935
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,887
Security camera

936
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
Brighten system

937
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,191
Gives me a lot of info

938
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:52,287
Information about who and what is in my home if my home is compromised

939
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,311
And I think

940
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,127
When you talk to people about those system

941
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,175
They find them

942
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,199
4

943
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,759
That information as opposed to

944
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,319
Why doesn't accept that their home is going to get

945
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,855
Broken into

946
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,159
They just want to understand

947
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,951
That it's happened when it's happen

948
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
Guess that makes sense

949
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,303
I think it's kind of a subtle difference in

950
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
How do you think about it

951
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,911
But I think it's worth kind of understanding that

952
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
Mindset

953
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,007
In one of her foundational beliefs is that

954
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:28,895
Again I didn't say we were LED lights in rear smash Oliver technology and go back to the Stone Age

955
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,735
We think you know one of these I I put it I haven't lost you agree and

956
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,295
I used to study

957
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,367
Stuff like this in the different schools of thought in

958
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:44,767
It's human nature to adopt things for their obvious immediate benefits but everything is a risk reward or cost-benefit equation

959
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:51,679
And we're really really good at seeing the obvious instantaneous benefits but we're really really bad at calculating the less obvious

960
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,215
Deferred cost

961
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,567
And what we're doing is our our attitude in our address to adopt

962
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,103
Anything and everything is

963
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,687
We've got to stop doing that cost benefit analysis

964
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:07,807
So if in fact the incremental risk introduced by technology is worth it

965
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,879
For the the games are going to get by all means do so

966
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,183
But we're not rendering very transparent

967
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
What does

968
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:19,583
Trade-offs are and we're not making very smart ones so it's not always more expensive for example

969
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:24,959
To make something playlist hackable we finally found the guy you first the first Bluetooth on insulin pump

970
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:28,031
Why the heck would you put a marble Bluetooth stack

971
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,335
Are insulin pump that can kill somebody

972
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:36,479
And there was no requirement to do so it was just kind of the bacon pretzel everything's better with bacon everything's better with Bluetooth and

973
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:42,623
Once they put it there every competitor had to also have it and they all implemented them with a vulnerable stack

974
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:49,279
It's like if you really want to do that either have it off by default or go through some some sort of threat modeling or adversaries

975
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,863
Resilience testing so you can have the benefit of the Bluetooth in the convenience

976
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,399
Without an elective

977
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,191
Wide-open attack surface

978
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
We war not against

979
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:03,871
The benefits of is iot I mean the the geek in me wants more and more my home to be connected and controllable

980
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:07,455
I just want to do it anyways where that risk is worth it

981
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,479
That makes sense

982
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,271
I am 100% with you

983
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:17,183
Well Josh thank you so much for coming on the show today I really appreciate it and I will add links to I am

984
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
In the cavalry

985
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,231
. org

986
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,255
In the show totes

987
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:24,095
And also to your your tedtalk that kind of explains kind of

988
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
The founding principles

989
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,911
Thank you so much for coming

990
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,703
Thank you for having
