00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,608
Hey everybody welcome to another episode of The Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,960
I have your host Stacey Higginbotham and here is my co-host

3
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,984
Wonderful

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,520
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:14,080
I love surprising Kevin I'm just

6
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:17,920
Never know what you're going to say I just know I just say my name I just read the cue cards

7
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,736
Heaven Waits for me

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,112
I guess you're talking to me all week there's nobody else to talk to you on this ship

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,392
Surprising

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,440
To be like in the founder of

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,464
Apple

12
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,024
Kevin tofel

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,840
I feel like no Aunt sorry

14
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,608
No no

15
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
All right

16
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,936
Speaking of Apple

17
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,960
Kevin got a

18
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,288
Present in the mail today he's waving it around like you guys can

19
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,312
See it

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,104
Kevin this is a podcast

21
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,640
I know I know

22
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,456
You can see it though and isn't this pretty its beak

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,992
38 mm

24
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,016
Apple watch

25
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:57,344
In space gray aluminum with black sports band

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
Yeah I've only had it for an hour

27
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,952
I'm already noticed a couple things though

28
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06,048
I know I've talked about the watch from going to the launch events

29
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,888
And I think I said oh yeah work really fine really quick everything else

30
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,984
It's not quite as quick in real life those can demo Zara

31
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:19,872
Contra reason I think I'm not saying it's like super sluggish but it's noticeably slower at certain things so

32
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,920
I am shocked

33
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,712
I mean shocked shocked

34
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
Do they have

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
May have manipulated

36
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
It's demos

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,184
Well I mean they're not the only company to do so by any means

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,976
And yeah I mean

39
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,048
It's again it's not slow but it's slower

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,704
It's also interesting the few apps that I put on here literally white just before the show started put the dark sky app with

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
The absolute love cuz it's like

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,056
Pinpoints of a minute when you're in a precipitation of some kind

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
I was using the app

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
And you know

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,688
Going to the screens and there's a

46
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,248
I'll add you use swiping if they wait a second

47
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,808
Because it's got to get its data from your phone

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
So there's a

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
I'm interesting

50
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
Aspects to it here

51
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,440
Very interesting aspects Twitter

52
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,840
And then decide to Stacey again before the shell sure there's everybody there's a lot going on here from user interface

53
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
Standpoint

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
BC was it

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,544
I wonder to shows ago you had somebody on there talking about the user interface challenges

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
Mark Rolston who is

57
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,152
The chief creative officer of argodesign

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,456
And this man knows you I

59
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
So he was

60
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
He was saying that

61
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
He felt it

62
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,136
One that there was a lot to learn but to he felt it

63
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,696
The Apple watch spends a lot of time

64
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
Conserving battery in that

65
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,000
Affected

66
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
It affects the user

67
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Experience

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
To the user's detriment

69
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:50,240
And I think I understand where he was going because as I get notifications in from my connected iPhone

70
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:55,616
You know if you don't take action on them right away they kind of Disappearing like one or two seconds and

71
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,920
NyQuil where to go how do I get it back

72
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,272
You just turn off the screen because you want to save battery life I can get that but

73
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,392
You know which of these two buttons do I press turn tablet or touch the screen do I swipe

74
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,720
Little learning curve involving not I'm trying not trying to

75
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
Dismiss this as a

76
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,328
Part that's too complex or difficult to use time will tell

77
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
But it's not

78
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,168
Clearly not to me a product that you're going to take out of the box

79
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,984
And in an hour or two or four even

80
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,336
Really have a good understanding of how to navigate around through all the glances to notifications

81
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
The apps

82
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
The

83
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:34,528
Friends bit where you have your favorite people showing so you can quickly send them a text or a call

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,160
So there's there's a lot going on at the store the best way to say it

85
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
Not that

86
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,256
Not trying to throw this out here to get on the Apple train

87
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
Are the watch train

88
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,840
Even my Pebble I still

89
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,168
Mess up and hit the wrong button to go forwards or backwards

90
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
It's

91
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,032
Navigate on a small screen when you have limited options

92
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
Buttons that you're not used

93
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,224
It and that's it right there right you know we were trying to cram a lot of interaction into a small device

94
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
And there's

95
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
Multiple

96
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
Touchpoints

97
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,880
No pun intended there's you know that the touchscreen itself that you can

98
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,416
You can tap you can also

99
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,488
Press down even harder for the force press to do something else

100
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,583
You got the digital Crown to spin around and also functions as a button

101
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
You got another button

102
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,447
You got voice interaction so there's there's a lot going on here

103
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
And again because of the battery management

104
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,567
Some of these things don't even work when the screen is not active

105
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,663
Right now the screen is inactive so if I were to say hey Siri

106
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,735
Nothing happens if I lift up my wrist

107
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,319
Now now it's inactive mode and hey Siri would do something

108
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,391
Interesting Lee you and I just tested a phone call

109
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,743
Which I was a little skeptical on how it would work but I've done two phone calls now

110
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:52,863
The one I just did with you I initiated by saying Hey Siri call Stacy and

111
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,399
It went right through and then

112
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,447
It's a Bluetooth headset to my phone

113
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,543
Whose symbol is quick

114
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
Probably what a foot from your face

115
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
And it sounded

116
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,735
It sounded like you were far away but it was no worse than taking call from someone who's in their cars

117
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
Right at the Atwood

118
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,087
Say it's more like a speakerphone type

119
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
Experience

120
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,951
And if you're in a quiet environment like I was in my home office talking to my son

121
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,535
As soon as the watch arrived he was on the school bus actually coming home

122
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,887
You can hear me just fine I could hear him just fine because I was in my quiet office

123
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
If I was out and about

124
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,007
The one thing I don't really want people hear my conversation but to

125
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
I probably wouldn't be able to hear so well so

126
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,895
So I again only an hour with it I'm not going to say too much

127
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,967
You like that yeah you got to have it or no don't buy one

128
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
Maybe we can revisit that

129
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,575
We're totally going to revisit that cuz I actually sent

130
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,719
Kevin some work more homework system I sent him some

131
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
Summer media work

132
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,559
I sent him some Hue bulbs

133
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,375
So hopefully he'll install those and he can play with

134
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
CSM connect a device

135
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
With his watching

136
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Look at him

137
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Is test out

138
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
What it feels like

139
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
Talk to a wife

140
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
Play with that

141
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,991
Yeah absolutely I mean you're giving me summer school homework already but

142
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
In my defense I time

143
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,319
Literally I've been taking my

144
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,671
Comp sci class at night school so that's over this week so I have no more excuses

145
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,999
I will get the Hue installed at the bulbs I will get things down installed

146
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
And I will play with the watch as these things all connect

147
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:31,167
Yes because the thread is what I'm going to fire you from the podcast heaven

148
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
I will do it

149
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
So

150
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
Other big news

151
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,335
In the kind of smart home front

152
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
When is

153
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
Comcast

154
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,967
Comcast which most people probably think of as

155
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
The cable company

156
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,319
That did not get a chance to buy Time Warner and make

157
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,623
More more Americans lives possibly

158
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
Miserable

159
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,231
We'll just go with it everybody hates the cable company

160
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,791
I'm not going to sugarcoat it I'm sorry Comcast

161
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
But

162
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
They have

163
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,655
A connected home and home automation product called Xfinity home

164
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
Earnings call this week

165
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
They said that they have

166
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:10,847
Play 500 thousand subscribers which is a really good number that is a lot of people

167
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
That's a good start

168
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,431
Ya adtpulse probably has a bit more

169
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
And they haven't actually released numbers but

170
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
I'm pretty confident

171
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Armoire

172
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,599
I feel like alarm.com probably has about a million

173
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
Is what they said

174
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
So

175
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
Good start for them

176
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,719
And today

177
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
Brian Roberts

178
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
The CEO of Comcast

179
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
Showed off at the cable show

180
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,887
Nine new partners for their business

181
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
And those Partners in

182
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Glued

183
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Nest

184
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,031
Makers of the smart thermostat that we all know and love

185
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
August smart locks

186
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Automatic

187
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
Which makes a

188
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
Connect a dongle for your

189
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,479
Automotive Diagnostics port in your car

190
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,575
Cough which actually I don't think is out yet but it's a connected it's a

191
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
Piece of connected jewelry that acts as a

192
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,183
Notification device for your

193
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
Phone

194
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
It's for women

195
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
And a activity tracker

196
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
It's pretty

197
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
It's actually very pretty

198
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,679
Lutron lighting woo Shadow to my favorite Lighting Company

199
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,775
Leo we talked about them on the show before the connected night light

200
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,335
That also doubles as a way to

201
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Here

202
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,919
It listens for your smoke detector and then send you a notification

203
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
Vacation if it goes off

204
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,247
It kind of is a way to retrofit your

205
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Protectors for

206
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
Smart Home

207
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
Smart idea

208
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,695
It includes rachio the wifi-connected sprinkler system

209
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
Skybell the connected doorbell

210
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
That let you see who's at your door

211
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
And

212
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
Whistle the activity tracker for dogs

213
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
Yay

214
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,263
So all of those companies are going to be

215
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,823
Available in work with Comcast

216
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
Xfinity home system

217
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,663
And I think this is brilliant for Comcast

218
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
And also for these startups

219
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,015
So Jason Johnson the CEO of August

220
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
Told me that this was

221
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
A no-brainer for his company because

222
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Comcast has

223
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
Massive

224
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Marketing muscle

225
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
Comcast is going to

226
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
Mark at the heck out of all these

227
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Startups

228
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
Through actually I think it's a little over

229
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,399
21 million subscribers

230
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
Across the US

231
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,727
And they pass a lot more homes

232
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
So

233
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,567
They send out mailers all the time and can you imagine

234
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
Imagine getting your

235
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,431
You're cool connected device it features one of those that's awesome

236
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,343
There's a lot of reach are formed for these startups in terms of Comcast marketing as you said subscriber base and saw

237
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Salon

238
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,695
And when I like on the flip side is Comcast isn't just

239
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:38,815
Saying we got home automation service that we can offer you and here's a switch and here's a door lock

240
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:43,679
There's a wide range of products that are which I really like such a smart smart play

241
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,775
Exactly and later this year Comcast is going to open up a nest

242
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,311
BK a software developer

243
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
Make it for

244
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
Other companies who want to

245
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Get in on the Comcast

246
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
Beecosystem

247
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
And this is this is nothing but good for Comcast

248
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
Cuz they've had kind of a lot of these

249
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Solder device

250
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
But it's been very closed as a Neko

251
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
And I get it

252
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
I mean

253
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,975
They've got to support all these customers

254
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
Is who

255
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
These aren't DIY

256
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,095
Customer sees our customers are calling up Comcast

257
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,447
You're calling of your cable provider and saying I really want the smart home stuff

258
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,263
You're not the kind of customer that's going to be like

259
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,823
Like me who's going to spend hours

260
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
Yeah playing in tweaking West

261
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,663
Another

262
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,991
DIY person I'm typically not a fan of

263
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
These

264
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:35,903
Companies that will provide monitoring services and such for a fee when I know I can do this myself and

265
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,487
But you know why I realize that you and I were definitely the minority here

266
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,535
The way for this Market to grow

267
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,863
Is through this type of approach so I think it's

268
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
Good for

269
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,191
Both sides you know the DIY people

270
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,751
Because it will eventually bring more products to the market

271
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,567
And then for the people who don't want to go with the complications and stuff

272
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,175
It brings you know a simple way for them to have their their services monitor

273
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,015
Comcast Comcast is providing space a service then

274
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,575
They are so what they do is

275
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,855
Typical canoe

276
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
Service business model

277
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,231
Comcast send out installers now right now

278
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
They will not install

279
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,679
Between the hours of 2 and 5 or I'm sorry I had to go there

280
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,471
No okay

281
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
So they they have installers

282
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
To do there

283
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
The current lineup

284
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
They don't install the new products

285
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,455
Yet the plan is eventually they will which is another great thing

286
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Because

287
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,551
Some people find installing an asteroid

288
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,159
Like my guess is they'll subcontract a lot of that out and it's

289
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,255
Here's an interesting tidbit I actually was almost an installer

290
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,071
It consultant type installer for Comcast

291
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
Modems way back in the day

292
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
What Kevin you can get in on this now

293
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:57,311
Do quite well for yourself back in the day it was something like $100 for an install

294
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
And this goes back to the 90s

295
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,663
Wow

296
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,015
Wasn't that like there's a company was actually here in town motive communication

297
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
They lived in Austin

298
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
They actually like

299
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
Totally killed that business

300
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
Baidu

301
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
Self automatic

302
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,535
Okay Telecom trivia for you guys they were now about by Alcatel-Lucent

303
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Sorry

304
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
Okay so

305
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
Comcast

306
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,471
Will come out to put all the stuff in

307
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,287
And then you pay you sign up for like a 2-year contract

308
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
And if you how much

309
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
It depends

310
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,711
It always depends and there's fine print and there's fees

311
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
The basic is

312
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,831
If you just want to do like the DIY stuff there's like a package

313
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Pikachu

314
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,207
Open close sensor when camera or Therma

315
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Thermostat

316
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
I think a lighting unit some other stuff for twenty bucks

317
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
And with a 2-year contract

318
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
They do all the

319
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
All the gear

320
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
I was part of it

321
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
And then there's

322
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,775
A monitor there's two levels of monitor

323
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,615
The cheaper version cost $40 a month

324
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
That has

325
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
3 Doors

326
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
Touchscreen controller

327
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
Fancy

328
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
One motion

329
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Sensor

330
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,159
And a wireless keypad and then there's a $50 a month one

331
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
It has like

332
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
Just more stuff

333
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,071
And both of those are monitored 24 so

334
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,119
And they have like a different level of

335
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
Insurance and assurance

336
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Associated

337
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
And those are

338
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
Professionally installed

339
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:35,103
There is a DIY installation option on the cheaper version

340
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
If you want

341
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
Or you can have the Comcast people

342
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
Come out and install it nothing

343
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,111
Terrible not terrible. I mean

344
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,463
It just depends on how you view your time and then you could buy additional sensor

345
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
And stuff like that

346
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
And I don't know how their pricing

347
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
Works on that stuff

348
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,191
Well now I know what the pinging iPhone bit on the Apple watch does sorry about that

349
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,591
We're keeping that in here Kevin now it's now you know what that sound is alright so so that's the Comcast news

350
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
Is it a big deal

351
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
And I think it's at those also

352
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,503
The home automation markets going mainstream

353
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,367
So we're getting there tell your friends they should be totally listening to the show

354
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
They could be even smarter

355
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
And next in the big news

356
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
Let's talk about

357
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,815
Everybody's favorite Gadget or maybe it's just fine

358
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
The Amazon Echo

359
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:34,495
I think it's just yours and now I'm kicking myself that I didn't get in on it for $99

360
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:40,639
If you can believe this I've actually just reapplied for an invite to buy the Amazon Echo

361
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,223
And I'm going to pay 149 for it because of my

362
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
Stupidity I guess

363
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,319
But here's what got me interested in it

364
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,343
All of a sudden

365
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:55,743
I saw on the if this then that log over the weekend they have introduced the Amazon Alexa Channel

366
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:00,351
It's funny that they're calling it the Amazon Alexa Channel when it's really Amazon Echo but I

367
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
I guess I get it

368
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:05,215
So basically you can now connect your Echo

369
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,311
Two up to it was 116 and 117 channels

370
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,919
So you can set up trigger events with if this then that and have things happen when you talk to Alexa

371
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,063
But there's a bit of a caveat as Stacey explain to me right before the show

372
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
So it's a bit Limited

373
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
And

374
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,207
You basically when you create an if this then that channel

375
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,559
You get what's called triggers and the triggers are the way that you

376
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,143
Create your recipe they're the things that they're the

377
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,959
Third event is this

378
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
Or the bad part

379
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
So

380
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
For Alexa that if this

381
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
Is all shopping list release

382
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
So Alexa has

383
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,895
Two features

384
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
That you can do that are kind of

385
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,991
And basically you can

386
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,063
Be a voice add things to a shopping list so

387
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
I walk around like

388
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Oh

389
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,927
Alexa add wrapping paper to my shopping list

390
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,023
Or Alexa add make a doctor's appointment for my daughter

391
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
To my to do list

392
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,631
Those are actually the only triggers right now

393
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,703
That the assistant that channel allows

394
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,287
So anything you want to do with Alexa

395
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
You have to do it through those which

396
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,151
Has created some crazy hacks

397
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
Yeah

398
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,527
So they are really useful ones actually around the to-do list like

399
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:29,695
Beforehand your to-do list in your shopping list actually only appeared in Amazon's app which was a stoop

400
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
The place for them because

401
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
I don't know about you but I don't create a grocery list

402
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,679
ICarly would like you to trust me

403
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,775
But you know my grocery list is actually it's actually a piece of paper but let's pretend I do it in

404
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
Now I can actually just send

405
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,895
All of that and mailed it with my grocery list on Evernote

406
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
Which is cool

407
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,015
It is so that that could be happening all the time in the background and that's it

408
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,855
That is cool but then there's the smarthome aspecting

409
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:02,463
What you did Stacey actually share their screen with me before the show

410
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:07,327
He showed me how to create a recipe to control her nest with the Alexa

411
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
So explain that one

412
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,215
Sure so if I wanted to create a recipe to make my nest

413
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
It's a little bit

414
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,823
It's super hacking no no sane person would actually

415
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
I would have to

416
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,895
Decide that my to do list

417
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,943
Would be mostly useful

418
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
Most useful as controlling my dad

419
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
And I would say

420
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807
If I ask

421
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
Alexa

422
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
What's on my to-do list

423
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
It's going to set my temperature

424
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
For my nest

425
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
And so

426
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
Whenever I'd say Alexa

427
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,815
What's on my to-do list

428
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
My recipe would automatically

429
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Play turn my nest

430
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
275 degree

431
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:48,799
Or whatever you can figure it in the recipe but that's the key you can only configure to one temperature

432
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
Right

433
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,615
Self super super happy here

434
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
Is super hacky

435
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
It's super Limited

436
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,503
And it's the same thing for any other smart home device

437
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,855
And because there's only probably there's about nine triggers

438
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,927
Because they're all equally hockey

439
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,999
You have to remember like if I wanted it to be like setting at

440
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,279
275 degrees

441
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,095
If I want to do smart things to turn off a series of Lights

442
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
I have to remember that

443
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,167
If I'm asking

444
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
What's on my to-do list

445
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,311
Control my nest if I'm saying add to my to do list that controls my living room lights

446
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,407
It's not logical here not not logical at all but

447
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
Hiatus start

448
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
I give

449
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
You know I give him some credit for

450
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
Figuring out how to do this and we know that the SDK for sale except for the echo came out

451
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,207
I want to say February early October or early March

452
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:43,327
It's early days yet and I think once that is official and

453
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
Make some progress

454
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,191
Maybe we'll see more trigger events or just better integration

455
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
I expect so

456
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
Amazon's got to prove these

457
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,847
They're being very careful about it I know a lot of people have

458
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,687
Apps in the works right now and some of them seem really cool

459
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
So

460
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,527
I'm really excited so far

461
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,111
So far it's great and you know I don't know if you saw this

462
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,439
You probably didn't see this because you're not using an echo

463
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:13,023
But they added the ability to talk to it and ask it about sports scores

464
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
So

465
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,095
My husband's walking through all the time asking

466
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
Alexa how are the Cardinals doing today

467
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
How are the St Louis Cardinals

468
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,335
Searching out my Arizona

469
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
Factual clarification

470
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,503
I mean if I had said the real Cardinals that would have been

471
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
So

472
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,367
It's just it's getting better

473
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
It's very exciting

474
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:45,791
It is it is and they just added too and I know we talked about in the past one or two shows they've added official support for

475
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,839
WeMo and some other things so

476
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,863
It's it's

477
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,703
It's starting to Intrigue me I didn't want to buy into it for the

478
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,239
Potential that it had

479
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,799
I want to buy a product that was

480
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,639
More useful at the time and I already see that it's getting more useful so

481
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,431
So is it now worth it

482
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
A 50 extra dollars

483
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:08,319
And with this if this and that caveat I don't know

484
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Which is

485
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Maybe you should

486
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:16,511
Wait on honestly maybe I will wait at all I've done so far is asked requested an invite

487
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
To repurchase

488
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Just so you know so

489
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
And even

490
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,423
If and when I get that which could be weeks away for all I know

491
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,775
I know they're Backwater for months so maybe I just let it be

492
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
See a lot of this

493
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,895
It's too early to say for sure a lot of this can actually be done right on my

494
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
My new watch

495
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,223
I could just say hey Siri

496
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,831
And there's Integrations there with a lot of these smart home type of things already so

497
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
Maybe redundant

498
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,415
Well speaking of your watch

499
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
We should go there for

500
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
Brief moment

501
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,023
My sources are telling me

502
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,839
That homekit maybe

503
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,399
Longer in the coming than we expected

504
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,471
I know I am expecting

505
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,799
Sometime in June that we should see something

506
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,103
But it's not the full on

507
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
The full-on roll out that we're expecting

508
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
It's much smaller

509
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
So

510
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
So

511
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,831
You know that

512
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:17,696
I've been at this may sound stupid but that bit that doesn't terribly surprised me and here's why

513
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
I know how long is a platform

514
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,048
However I also know that

515
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,608
Apple wants to make some of its own devices

516
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:29,984
And I think it's not just going to put the platform out there without its own devices so if they're not ready

517
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:34,336
If Apple Hardware isn't ready I don't think you're going to see a lot of movement

518
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,896
On third-party Hardware support just yet

519
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
Well

520
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,992
We had that means we got a whole lot of weight and going on

521
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
I'm so

522
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
Soap

523
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832
Get that insteon Gear Up

524
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:51,488
Screw in. We'll see how that works for you I can guarantee you that I will be able to screw in

525
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Green light bulbs

526
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,328
By the time we have our next show cuz the lightbulbs are on their way to my house

527
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
They are there

528
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Should be there tomorrow

529
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
Okay so

530
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
I guarantee you

531
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:04,544
I will be able to talk about light bulbs and controlling them from my Apple watch and other ways

532
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
Next week

533
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,128
Excellent well that's a good Segway for a scab

534
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
Because

535
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,224
Our next big news stories are lighting related

536
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
It's right now in New York City

537
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,808
Is light fare

538
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
Which

539
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
I wish I were there

540
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
I really do

541
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,696
Yes because

542
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,256
Everybody who has a light bulb

543
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
Is there an

544
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Y'all

545
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
I love it

546
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
I love it

547
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,544
Couple big announcements from the show there is a fancy fancy pants lighting company that actually based in Austin

548
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,080
In Texas called ketra

549
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,384
It has done something really cool

550
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,176
It is been hanging out

551
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,992
For 6 years actually in stealth mode

552
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,064
Serving the commercial Market since about last year

553
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,624
They have an LED light bulb

554
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
That

555
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
It cost between

556
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
100 +

557
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
130 bucks

558
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
Purple

559
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
So expensive

560
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,584
Mostly for high-end residential in

561
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,608
Commercial markets

562
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,144
You can find it in

563
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
Auto dealers

564
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
MGM hotels

565
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,544
The Tiffany store in New York the Art Institute of Chicago

566
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
The cool thing about these bulbs

567
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
What is

568
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
The LED light

569
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,408
Inside

570
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,456
The semiconductor part the LED

571
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,296
It not only emits light like a light emitting diode

572
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
It also

573
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:24,160
Receive some of the light some of the receptors actually turn into sensors

574
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,976
So it's self Tunes itself itself calibrated

575
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
To self

576
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
Which is kind of cool

577
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,400
So that is pretty cool actually can be tuned to like different Pantone colors

578
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,472
It checks itself throughout the day

579
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,752
Basically

580
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:43,104
But it's still running along the right software program so it's incredibly consistent

581
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
And

582
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,176
Just kind of super fancy

583
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,736
Apparently all these other companies that is like tested it

584
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
Love it

585
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
I have

586
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,856
I've seen it a demo over a

587
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,184
A computer which is a terrible way to evaluate like

588
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,744
Play Kai yes over my webcam that lights

589
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,512
Looks amazing

590
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
Indiana

591
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:10,752
I'm in tree go by there the self calibration in the end more smarts as opposed to just a radio for communications that's

592
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,824
Essentially a wireless switch right

593
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,152
Putting in more smarts in these things makes them far more interesting to me

594
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,016
So we'll see I'm actually going to pop by and check them out when they're not at like Fair

595
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,040
Because they are in my home

596
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
Downtown

597
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
And check out the quality of the light

598
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
And

599
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,696
I will not be able to put them in my house they guesstimate that it

600
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,744
It's going to be about a thousand bucks per room

601
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
So

602
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
Yeah if you're feeling fancy though

603
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,352
And you want to invest in these

604
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
Papa man let me know what you think

605
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Because

606
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
I'm intrigued

607
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,288
They have some amazing software patterns obviously everybody's got them

608
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,592
Which brings me to another announcement

609
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
GE

610
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:52,480
Also that G's lighting division they announced a partnership yesterday

611
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,528
Monday with Apple

612
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:59,136
Did they are going to bring out a new consumer light bulb that will work with homekit

613
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,720
It will be later this year it is a tunable white light

614
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
Which means

615
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
Runs up and down the White

616
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
Color spectrum

617
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,888
I love that because I've often bought

618
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,728
Bob's without paying attention to the light or the white color and

619
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
I've gotten

620
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,568
They're just you know either soft white when I want a natural

621
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Sunlight

622
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,128
Eyeballs or vice versa

623
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
Yeah that's very good

624
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
So

625
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
I don't know

626
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:29,344
I feel like if you're going to go tunable you might as well go all in on full color but

627
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
It depends on how much they

628
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
I mean yeah

629
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
Obviously it's all about

630
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
Standard consumer

631
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,120
I don't get out much like the sunlight

632
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:46,240
Type bulbs will the GE they're playing at their circadian rhythm there is natural sunlight thing

633
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:50,592
But you know the way they were playing it up though I was kind of like does no one else

634
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:55,200
There's no one else did she realize it every other light bulb has a circadian rhythm pattern

635
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
Do they think this is new

636
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,040
It's very

637
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,696
It felt very much like she was very excited about stuff that people were excited about like a year-and-a-half ago

638
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
I don't know

639
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
Well

640
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:12,352
I mean they have to sell their product I got to build the hype just like everybody else I don't really have a problem with that

641
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,400
You're so you're so generous

642
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,984
They also did a deal with Qualcomm

643
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Jeeves like

644
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,824
All over this are like lightning we're on it

645
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
Qualcomm

646
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,224
To put something that is not a beacon but sounds just like a beacon in retail

647
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,760
It's called

648
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,296
Visible light communication

649
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
VLC

650
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
Basically

651
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,672
It uses the camera in your smartphone

652
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,768
In encodes in the light to the LEDs omitting information that

653
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,048
Can be read by an app that

654
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,840
It's running on a consumer's smartphone

655
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
And this

656
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,656
This app uses

657
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,936
That

658
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,240
To basically triangulate your position in the

659
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
Store

660
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,544
Based on the lights

661
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
And that

662
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,616
Tells the app where you

663
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
You are

664
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152
So

665
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,200
It's not a beacon but it behaves like a bee

666
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,504
Beacon in GE thinks this is amazing

667
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:07,648
I think it's a little weird because I don't know if I'm going to be walking through the store with my phone out

668
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,536
The technologist behind it said that you don't they're still going to be using radios to pinpoint you

669
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
In the store and then

670
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Ideas

671
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:22,496
If you're going to pull out your phone to look up for more information that's when it would pop up and get it to you which is the perfect

672
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
What time to do so make sense

673
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,824
But I'm still kind of like

674
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:32,224
I know so many things are vying for attention now and sometimes it don't want that you just want to

675
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,272
Just want to go walk around the store and

676
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
I don't want things pinging me off all the time

677
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:43,232
Yeah it is like this way it doesn't ping you because it won't know where you are so I was like oh that's nice he's like so if you're standing there

678
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
Front of the toothbrush

679
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:48,096
Are the toothpaste aisle inside of your like there are 30 options here which one do I choose

680
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,912
Maybe you pull out your phone to research it and suddenly

681
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
It says

682
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,704
Oh look

683
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,056
I see you're standing in front of the toothpaste do you want some more information and then you can be like

684
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,592
Why yes vote I do

685
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
I don't know

686
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,944
I mean in Subway's I'm like oh that could make sense I just

687
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
I don't know

688
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,320
So that's that's the kind of that's how GE plans to take on lighting and make it awesome

689
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,112
And let's see

690
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
I think

691
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,416
That's a lot of stuff

692
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,952
Do we have any other stuff

693
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:18,560
There's some there's a little bit about we know they re up there if this then that channel

694
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,984
The connected Cree LED bulbs that are so awesome and cheap those now actually work with the WeMo system

695
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,264
So that brings

696
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,080
That means your Cree light bulbs will work with

697
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,616
Philips Hue system

698
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
And with the WeMo system

699
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,968
Yeah it's a nice way to get those

700
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
Kinkos light bulbs are like

701
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,784
15 bucks

702
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,600
So they're cheap connected

703
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
And

704
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
They work with law

705
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,184
Lots of different system so

706
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
Don't get some cuz yeah

707
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,512
Why not

708
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:54,656
Alrighty well this week we don't have a guest on the show's given there so much news and I'm trying to wrap up

709
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
Figure out

710
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,008
Some editing things in getting the show on iTunes

711
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
So

712
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,640
Stay tuned for all of that and

713
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
More

714
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:10,272
And with that we'll call it a wrap and we will see you next time on the iot podcast
