Complaints for the Philips Hue we have updates on wink and WeMo

15
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:40,448
Course talk about the bass story about government

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,472
And

17
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,264
Maybe we'll start off with

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,544
Stuff from Toy Fair

19
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,616
Family that Barbie has a new smart home

20
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
Yes she does

21
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
It's cheaper than yours

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,712
HEB

23
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,736
299

24
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,784
Smart home for Barbie

25
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,832
Edison smart home comes with

26
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,368
Voice commands that you're tipped

27
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,392
Can't get to Smart Hub

28
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,416
Are the Barbie Dreamhouse

29
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,720
What does it do Kevin

30
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:08,096
It's got a little party mode that flashes lights and plays music and

31
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:12,704
You can turn the staircase from the second floor of the first floor into a slide

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,568
Very cool there's an optional accessory that you can purchase also

33
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,640
The Starlight Adventure RC hoverboard

34
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,968
So Barbie can go around the house in her own little

35
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,760
Hoverboard which really doesn't help her butt

36
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,832
Wait we're not going to go there right now

37
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,392
Entirely it is a separate accessory

38
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,928
Oh okay awesome

39
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,696
That would be

40
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,024
Awesome if she could actually hop on the hoverboard and hover but

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
Okay

42
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:44,192
You can put the lights on in the house operate the elevator wait a second why does she have stairs a slide and an elevator

43
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216
Barbie Dreamhouse

44
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,032
Normally Barbie dream house does not come with

45
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
Stairs

46
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:53,664
I had a Barbie Dreamhouse my daughter has grown out of her Barbie Dream House

47
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
I'm going to tell you guys

48
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Peace

49
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
Crap

50
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,856
I'm just going to lay it out there

51
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:06,976
These things are made of the dinky has plastic you will ever encounter

52
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
I have broken

53
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,608
Like my daughter's Barbie Dreamhouse I broke putting it together at this was like

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,168
The quintessential made in China

55
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936
Just don't

56
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:20,288
Just don't so I'm not sure if this is something you really want to invest in

57
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,872
Personally I would take some little bits or some other toy

58
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,456
I just make your own like connected adventure for Barbie

59
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,016
You know I like a doll house or something

60
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,600
Just buy the $99 I think it might be 150

61
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,928
I think Barbie's dreamhouse unconnected is like a hundred fifty bucks

62
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
It's not cheap

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,024
That's why it was so galling to know houses

64
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
Now that's a Smart House

65
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
So anyway

66
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
Barbie Dreamhouse

67
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,472
Also threw out there that Mattel showing at the Toy Fair this year

68
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,544
A $300 connected printer for kids witch

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
Personally $300

70
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
I would go with

71
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
Instead of the Dreamhouse

72
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,992
Kudos to Mattel I mean they're there

73
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:05,344
Changing with the times that got into to go with it the Internet connected Barbie Dream House

74
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
You got the

75
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,488
Thingmaker which actually used to have back in the day with obviously wasn't a 3D printer

76
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,536
When you can like make your own toys

77
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,840
They're big into the

78
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,400
Virtual reality that got the View-Master

79
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,216
I mean you know what they're really changing with the times

80
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,544
They are all have some issues with her

81
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,592
They had a Barbie that they worked with

82
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,664
Company and that Barbie actually

83
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Kind of

84
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
I had some security issues

85
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
Remember

86
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
Barbie

87
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
Expired Norco

88
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Concern

89
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
And

90
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
You know so that that was hopefully

91
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,720
As they're bringing this stuff online they're going to

92
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,536
Turn a little bit about locking that stuff down so

93
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,632
We're going to talk about that in a minute this would be a brilliant Segway but I want to get some of the

94
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
Smaller news out of the way

95
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,520
Talking about Barbie dream house it is voice control just like our favorite

96
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Suffice

97
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
BabyCenter favorite

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
It's up there

99
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
Amazon Echo

100
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
We got some news

101
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
Kevin wasn't here last week

102
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
So we didn't talk about

103
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
Amazon integrated

104
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
Spotify

105
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Yeah

106
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
I'm so excited

107
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,000
You're like the biggest Spotify fan I know like you couldn't wait for it to be on Sonos

108
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
You just that's awesome

109
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
And the best part about this is

110
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,887
So we tested in our house cuz again

111
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,215
We have Sonos we have Echo with Spotify you can

112
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Play

113
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
When you're playing Spotify

114
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,127
On your Echo you can also play Sonos or Spotify on your Sonos

115
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
And it doesn't shut it down

116
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
Probably cuz it's on the same Wi-Fi

117
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
And you'll have a family

118
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
So that was pretty sweet

119
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
The other thing that I thought was awesome

120
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Is

121
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
Android handset

122
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
You can actually Chromecast

123
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
Your

124
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,047
Okay if you're playing Spotify on your phone

125
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,095
When you come into your living room

126
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Or it's whatever room your Echoes In

127
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
You can actually Chromecast

128
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
The Spotify

129
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Music

130
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
Right onto your Chrome

131
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,567
Is your Echo so it is resist a Chromecast

132
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:08,479
Now that's really interesting I didn't know that because I don't have Spotify I don't live in Stacy's dream home I don't have all these things

133
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
It's getting there

134
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:14,367
You know you can you can Chromecast it to any available Chromecast device switch

135
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
The echo apparently is

136
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,463
Know that until I come

137
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:25,119
I don't think it has been never before that's what that's why I'm saying this is really interesting because

138
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
You know Google has the Chromecast audio in the car

139
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
Chromecast video devices in the old Chromecast

140
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,335
They've got the Chromecast extension so you can pretty much ahead

141
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
Computer to any

142
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
Chromecast setup

143
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,711
I did not know that they've

144
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
Use that

145
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,295
To integrate into the echo

146
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
Pictures of China

147
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
I like it

148
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
I believe you I had

149
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,279
I believe you now I'm wondering if I can

150
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,631
I got an Android phone I've got an echo I wonder if I can Chromecast other stuff

151
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
2D Echo

152
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
Now you have homework

153
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,751
Not so I can live with this homework

154
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Just getting to

155
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
Let me ask you is your

156
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:10,431
Phone already connected to the echo via Bluetooth cuz that's how you would normally connect

157
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
It is

158
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,015
Connected I do randomly disconnected

159
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
It's so

160
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,879
It might be doing it that way although no cuz it gives you

161
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,951
It tells you that it's a Chromecast Apple device

162
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,279
Unless it's just because I've on a Nexus and it's just like

163
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,839
Bluetooth equals Chromecast but that would be weird right

164
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:34,239
It doesn't over Wi-Fi as well I'm it uses Bluetooth but also Wi-Fi so no it's not just the Bluetooth connection

165
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
So I'm

166
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Connor

167
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,127
Stymied on this because I didn't realize that you could do that

168
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,687
And to be honest I'm real quick on in my apps

169
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
For the echo just to see if there's

170
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
Anything in the settings

171
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,575
That's new that I have might have missed

172
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
Well it going

173
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,903
Interesting

174
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951
Well I'm going to have to

175
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Ed Westwick

176
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,535
Yeah and turn off

177
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
Later not this not this show

178
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,631
But next show

179
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,935
Yes so the echo is one of my paired devices

180
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
So it could be

181
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
I don't know I'm just

182
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,335
Eucharist how this all works with the Chromecast

183
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
So that's what I am definitely look into that

184
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,479
Well here we go I turn I unpaired it

185
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
So now we're going to see

186
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
If devices available

187
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,415
Oh so it's still available and it's through Spotify connect

188
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,743
Now so is it available on the Chromecast

189
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Through Spotify

190
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,423
Then you know what I'm guessing it is specific to Spotify and it would Spotify emblem

191
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
This way

192
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Twitter app

193
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
If and if that's the case and I can't like

194
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Say

195
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
Chromecast

196
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
Google Music to the echo

197
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
Like that you know

198
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,295
That's okay I'm still going to take a look around because it's very interesting

199
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,135
Development here it is it is through Spotify now

200
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,719
Beforehand it's it gave me the Chromecast option but now it's giving me

201
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,511
Spotify so what I turned off Bluetooth

202
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Okay

203
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Centrist

204
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
Mystery solved

205
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
All right

206
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,959
Did it there's more

207
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Yo there's more

208
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
There is more

209
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Alright Kevin

210
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:17,919
This will be kind of quick but very interesting for people who have an ecobee3 home thermostat

211
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,759
Because you now have native Amazon Echo integration

212
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,599
And that's very different than using say a skill

213
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:30,207
Or if this than that like we've done with the Echo and nest in the pass this is

214
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Straight up integration

215
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Full support

216
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,815
I do not have an ecobee3

217
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Unfortunately I cannot test it

218
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
I do not have

219
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,959
I have been using with my ecobee SI

220
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,031
If this then that integration with my

221
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,079
Amazon Echo and it has been

222
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,359
A little weird

223
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
Because

224
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,711
It only gives you a certain number of degrees and not all of them

225
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,247
So when I say

226
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
You know so-and-so trigger ecobee warmer

227
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,879
I can only select you know what I trigger that I

228
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Can trigger

229
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
It to do

230
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
6 degrees

231
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
69 degrees in 71 degrees

232
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,071
I can't trigger to do 72

233
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
So it's a little like

234
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:14,239
It's pre-specified as to the the temperature so if there's a temp that you want does not support of your kind out of

235
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
I just have to get as close as possible

236
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
So

237
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
That's really important to you

238
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,663
You got to have to open up your phone and turn on the air

239
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
There you go and then finally

240
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Man

241
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
Amazon skills

242
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
You can call an Uber

243
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,415
You can order your pizza from Dominos

244
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
Which in all the reading

245
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,815
It looks like the best way to do that is to actually pick one kind of pizza that you really like and then

246
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,607
Order that one all the time

247
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
I'm so if you're the kind of person who like

248
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,495
Stop nose and likes the same kind of pizza that this is for you

249
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,103
For me

250
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,455
I was going to ask if you if you order frequently from Domino's and I'm guessing not

251
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,831
But that's okay that's okay we do order from the Amazon

252
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Is it favor

253
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
Saber hits Amazon Now app

254
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
It has the restaurants

255
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,743
We actually have some regulars there so

256
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
I could get my

257
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,119
Austin had a restaurant called phonatic we did

258
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
Vietnamese ordered all the time from that so

259
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,703
Definitely

260
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
Okay there is three things

261
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Three things

262
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
You can call your Echo

263
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
I didn't realize this I thought there were only two

264
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
Which was I'm going to say it

265
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
Everyone bikes down

266
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
Shield your ears

267
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
You can either call it the Alexa

268
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Or the Amazon

269
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
But I just discovered this

270
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
You can actually call it three things

271
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
You can call it Alexa

272
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,231
Amazon or Echo

273
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
The world just went crazy with tights

274
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,119
I know I've liked I warned y'all

275
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
It was like the trigger warning

276
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
But if you do that

277
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,239
I'm going to warn you if you're not going to list or show

278
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
Because we're going to keep calling at the Amazon Echo

279
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
That's the news on that for

280
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,455
It is and just to add to it or close it up

281
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:03,807
It's interesting to me that over the past two weeks I've seen so many articles

282
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,135
Mainstream articles television spots

283
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,183
Where everything you do what

284
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,975
Amazon has a sleeper hit

285
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
Amazon's going to control Smart Home

286
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,351
I'm sitting here going where have you people been for the last 14 months

287
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,935
Come on tell all those people like everyone who's like

288
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,727
Oh my gosh have you heard of this device

289
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
Tell him about a podcast y'all

290
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
Okay moving right along

291
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
Philips Hue

292
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
You have an Android phone

293
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
If you don't have an Android phone you may want to

294
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,415
If you have an Android phone they just updated their app

295
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
2

296
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
Work with Android

297
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Is it 6.1

298
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,559
A 6.0 Android marshmallow

299
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
So

300
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,399
They just updated it and boy people are up

301
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,471
Set because they updated it to allow

302
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
Permissions for geofencing

303
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:01,919
Location of where and then access to videos on videos and photos on the phone which they use to sew you

304
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
You can

305
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
Your Bachelor lights

306
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
Have a fun feature

307
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
People link

308
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
But

309
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
They did it wrong

310
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
That's what we're thinking what would Stacy night before the show actually tested out the most updated app and we're in

311
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Some problems

312
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
And

313
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,607
I haven't read the reviews of the latest version of Stacey hasn't said that

314
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
Philips is getting hammered over this and I can now see why for people who don't know Android 6.0 bring

315
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,311
More granular permissions to apps

316
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
Runtime permission

317
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,175
And so that way either either when you install or when you use an app

318
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:40,831
If you need to Grant permission to the app you have the choice for summer to have IOS does it and there are three permission

319
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
Is that Stacy just mentioned that are in the the new app it's the location allow access to media and files and

320
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
Allow access to photos and such

321
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
And the thing is that's the way Android

322
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
6.0 apps are supposed to work

323
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,751
If you don't have Android 6.0 which most people don't you're not going to take full advantage of this yet so

324
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
Don't sweat it

325
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,591
Season 6 out

326
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
And when we actually denied

327
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,967
Access to the app to say look at our photos

328
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,295
The apps like okay and how about this permission how about that permission

329
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
Super geofencing in Media

330
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,367
And then the after shutdown

331
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,951
How about know what's supposed to happen is

332
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:24,351
The app is supposed to run just not have that feature where would access the photos turn on or whichever feature YouTube

333
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
It should not have access to

334
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Unfortunately app

335
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
Just shuts down

336
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
We also found out that

337
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
If you go through the process of

338
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
Enabling permissions or deny permissions

339
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,711
And then you go back into the app it may ask you again in fact we denied all the permissions

340
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,991
Went back in the app

341
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,319
On the second time it's got a little check box it says never ask me again

342
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,415
So what do we do we check the check boxes never ask me again and deny permissions

343
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
At that point

344
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,767
You can't even go back and change those permissions

345
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
Because you've already said don't ask me again so

346
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:00,703
It's really kind of flaky right now does not seem like it's been implemented a hundred percent correct

347
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:06,591
If you do run into the problem station I ran into where we couldn't even change the permissions anymore because we said never ask again

348
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,895
You just need to uninstall the app and reinstall the app

349
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
Yes cuz what happens if you do not have permission

350
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
You can't open your

351
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
It's just going to shut down

352
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,647
Exactly you did was just there but it won't do a darn thing for it just shuts right now

353
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
So if you want to control your lights

354
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
So basically everyone's upset

355
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
Because they're like

356
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,071
I just want to give you all my permissions

357
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,119
My location

358
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,679
Cute you're in my house that's all I want to do

359
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
Turn my lights

360
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
I need to know where I am

361
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
He's like

362
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,895
Yeah it's not supposed to work that way and I suspect they're going to fix it

363
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
Pretty quickly I would hope

364
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,735
She has done a great job when everyone

365
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
It was like so hats off about you like

366
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
Messing up

367
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
The friends with Hughes.

368
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,951
Community we were like okay

369
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
We are not going to

370
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
You guys are on your own

371
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,863
With enough support on these things but we're not going

372
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
2

373
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Turn off

374
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
And make things not work

375
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
With our app

376
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
They fix that pretty quick re-read

377
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
Yeah it was

378
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,663
Yes so I'm assuming I reached out to Hugh they haven't gotten back to me but I sent it

379
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
Pretty late last night

380
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:15,967
So

381
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
They haven't got back to me

382
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
And

383
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
They're usually pretty responsive so I would imagine

384
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
So that's the Philips Hue stuff in the meantime

385
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
Uninstall

386
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Reinstall

387
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
Except permission

388
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
If you don't want to accept permissions

389
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,399
You gotta know if you update your app

390
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
So there you go

391
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Wink

392
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
Has updated their firmware

393
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
And their software

394
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,527
Yeah yeah I am so happy because as anybody who's Will Smith show knows I'm not 100% sold on a cloud

395
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
Only type Smart Home

396
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
And now I've got

397
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,647
What is direct access

398
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,439
2 between the app

399
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
And my lights

400
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
Provided that on the same Wi-Fi network

401
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,559
Which they are so it's not a problem

402
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,911
And what that does is if the cloud goes down I don't have to worry about I can still control my lights

403
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
The Wink app

404
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
And even better

405
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,519
There's reduce latency because you cut out the hole

406
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
Send

407
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
Command from the app

408
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,151
After the Hub how did the cloud cloud back to the hub Hub to the light

409
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
It's just direct app

410
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Two light

411
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,759
It's a beautiful thing I definitely noticed

412
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Less latency

413
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,575
Lights turn on and turn off faster

414
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
I'm so so happy about this

415
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,975
So the other thing to know is

416
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
WeMo also at the W Front

417
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
Which you know has the

418
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
Who in alphabetically by the way

419
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,447
Amazon Philips twinkle wink and WeMo

420
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
Close enough

421
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,311
Football

422
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,127
Which is the Belkin smart

423
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
Stuff

424
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,479
Update your software finally

425
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,015
I know you guys I don't know actually

426
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,599
I don't know if you remember but they said way back in like

427
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,695
The fall of last year that by the end of January they were going to really like

428
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
Focus on their software

429
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
It was going to be up to date in

430
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
Lawless

431
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Better

432
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
But better

433
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Put better

434
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:16,031
Because it was really a mess I mean like I don't know how many of you guys there's 1.5 million people who get stalled WeMo

435
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
Stop out there so that's a lot

436
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,639
Some of that stuff was really just

437
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
The devices were always nice

438
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
This is just a software experience

439
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
You know sometimes it was just telling reliable

440
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
Ivor YouTube

441
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
Switch like

442
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,951
Daylight savings time this would happen and then suddenly nothing would work and you be like why

443
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
So it's better

444
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:42,655
Actually the beginning of February and its four star review

445
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
Storage they were happy to put out

446
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
On my end I've noticed

447
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,591
It talks actually a lot better to the

448
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
Amazon Echo

449
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Which is nice

450
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
There's a lot less like

451
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,527
I don't know what you're talking to or that network devices available

452
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
I've also noticed

453
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
Stat

454
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
It doesn't

455
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,415
Sometimes

456
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,487
Things we could ask you like so if I turned it off in the app

457
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,607
Theater wouldn't recognize that it had already been turned off and so it'd be like yeah I can't

458
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
I can't mess with it right now

459
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Seem to talk to

460
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Each other just

461
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:22,591
So maybe better synchronization between WeMo and other items other hubs

462
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
Panda

463
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,271
Stability is important to me that mine's been pretty good I just have the Insight switch on a LED bulb in the bedroom

464
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
Shut it off every night before bed

465
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,111
Eight nine times out of 10

466
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:39,743
Pretty solid but every once in a while I got a hiccup when I'm hitting the button and nothing's happening. It says I can't connect can't see it

467
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,791
I'm on the same network in the same room

468
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,423
So hopefully I mean I just got the app update hopefully it's gets it to 10 out of 10 times

469
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
10 out of 10

470
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,751
Pretty girl

471
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
1990

472
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
Alright Fido

473
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
Final

474
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,367
Let's do it let's Dive Right In

475
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Going to be good

476
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
So the big issue

477
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,327
Last week it really I'm going to say going forward for quite some time to come

478
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,399
The internet of things and using it to spy on

479
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,447
People how does that make you feel Kevin

480
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
Not good

481
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,823
Okay so James Clapper the US Director of National Intelligence

482
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,663
Came and spoke to the Senate armed services

483
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,223
And it's an annual review of like

484
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,783
Hey this is what's going on in intelligence

485
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
Surveillance intelligence

486
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
Threats

487
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,647
Does a threat report

488
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,439
So in it he said

489
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:46,303
In the future intelligence Services might use the internet of things for identification

490
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
Surveillance

491
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
Location tracking

492
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
And targeting for recruitment

493
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,727
Or to gain access to networks or user credentials

494
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
Everybody was like

495
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,615
Holy cow Internet of Things

496
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
Could be used to spy on people

497
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,199
And I'm kind of like yeah we

498
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,759
Do that right yeah we should have

499
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,087
We've had the thing about this Samsung TVs they can listen in

500
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,391
And people are rightly worried about you know

501
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:15,487
The Amazon Echo they're like oh you know what they're always listening and the answer is no

502
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,023
Is not always listening

503
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,839
It only listens for about half a second when you

504
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,935
Or it only recordes sorry it only record your statement

505
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
4

506
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
About half a second

507
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,031
But it is always listening

508
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
It's just

509
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,639
What adheres doesn't go anywhere until here's the trigger word

510
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
Bright

511
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,223
And for those of you who are actually really

512
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
Paranoid

513
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,807
There's a setting where you can actually turn on

514
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
A chime

515
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
Did people make

516
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,159
When it actually is

517
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,463
Sending your words to the cloud

518
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
So

519
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
You can actually

520
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,655
While you're looking for that this was also a big to-do when Microsoft decided to require

521
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,447
Originally the Xbox

522
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,495
Kinect with the Xbox One

523
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,335
If people say that's always listening it's always looking what are they doing

524
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
It's under

525
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,151
Your device O Mine

526
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
Stacy's

527
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319
Thunder sounds

528
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,855
And then there's a

529
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
Wake up sound

530
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,976
So it says play a confirmation sound when you wake your Alexa device

531
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,024
And then an end of request sound

532
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,840
Play confirmation sound after you finish speaking

533
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Alexa

534
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
There you go

535
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,936
And they're two different things so

536
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,496
If you want one but not the other you can do that

537
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
Yay

538
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
Okay

539
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,592
So that's the Amazon

540
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
And Amazon

541
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
Keeps all that information

542
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
Sew in

543
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,480
Kind of talking to companies

544
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,272
There's a couple things that they

545
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Think about here

546
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
1

547
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,368
Is people should be aware

548
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,392
Of what their devices

549
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,720
Not just what they do but what they have the ability

550
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,376
Okay glad I was going to say this might be too but I would say companies need to

551
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
Clearly explained

552
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,496
How these things work so that people can make their informed decisions as well

553
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Yes

554
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
3

555
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
Companies need to also

556
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,064
Well actually companies need to make a point of not becoming a pipeline of data to

557
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
The US government

558
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
Dirty joke

559
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,232
Needs to remember

560
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
4th of May

561
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,328
Which is the protection against unreasonable search and seizure

562
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,864
Just in case you guys are like

563
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
What's happening again

564
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
Because

565
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,336
We got the Constitution right in front of us all the time

566
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
How is Caribou Coffee

567
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
So

568
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,456
Let's break this down because there's a couple things here

569
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,760
A reasonable and that you can do today

570
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,576
You can say hey

571
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,416
But if you're listening to the show you probably have already

572
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Not done yet

573
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,232
For considering doing that

574
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
So

575
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,096
There are things like we're actually about to talk to

576
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
Argos

577
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,656
The show is actually

578
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,728
Making a device that actually doesn't go online

579
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:10,336
It does go online but it has privacy safeguards and we'll talk about that

580
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,152
So there are devices that

581
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,432
Don't actually ever have to

582
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
Connect to the cloud

583
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,272
Where the connect to the cloud in a limited way it have

584
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Encryption

585
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
The CEO of

586
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,856
Silk which makes

587
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
The sense

588
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416
Smart home hub that way to talk about

589
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
Is

590
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,232
They do encryption and in

591
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,280
Encryption so your data is always

592
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,584
If it's in the cloud encrypted

593
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
Device encrypted

594
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
So even if he has to give over your

595
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
Your data

596
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
All he's

597
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
Able to give

598
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
That's the way it should be

599
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,360
This means that he can't you

600
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
Build a business

601
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Steak

602
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,688
Selling your data

603
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
So

604
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Think about that

605
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
So there's those kind of

606
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,344
And then there's also things like

607
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,136
If your company

608
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:00,256
And they're going to give you a privacy policy maybe they should give your privacy policy that isn't like

609
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
40 pages of legal aid

610
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
Maybe I should be a little bit

611
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
Better

612
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,912
And maybe you should ask them like

613
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,216
How do you participate with the government

614
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
Do you have things

615
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Looks like

616
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
Do

617
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:15,360
Wait for subpoenas her if the government comes to you do you just like

618
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
Headed over

619
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,712
Yeah. You need to understand what that companies

620
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
Policy is in that situation

621
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
So there are those kind of things

622
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
I don't know

623
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
Kevin what do you think

624
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,440
I mean it's it's really

625
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,744
I said this before and I don't people

626
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,560
Some people have not liked it when I say it but with we almost

627
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:40,960
With crossed a barrier when it comes to privacy mean if you want certain Services you're going to have to give up data

628
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:47,360
Having said that I'm not saying company should have free rein to do what they want with that data that's that's a totally different aspect.

629
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,712
So like you said you just say offline by devices that don't connect anywhere but

630
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
You know

631
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:58,624
It's kind of tough to go back and I want you cross that line and and have access all this information on your own the information that you want

632
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,672
What services that provide value to

633
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,304
So now I think it does come to town to some of the tenants that you just said in that is understanding

634
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,376
What advice can and can't do with a company

635
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,680
Who creates a device that provides a service

636
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:15,520
What it is they do what what do they collect what do they use today to 4

637
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:19,104
How did they Safeguard it and what situations might be

638
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
Might be provided to a third party

639
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,480
Weather Sacramento or not and it was just a matter of understanding

640
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:29,600
Of course we're assuming there's Clarity and truthfulness and what two companies tell us obviously so

641
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,392
There's there's a lass back there too

642
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,208
We're also assuming that when the government comes

643
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
I was knocking to come knocking

644
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,768
Turn my front door is supposed

645
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,608
Frappuccino come siphoning off data

646
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,912
Without anyone at the company knowing

647
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
When is prism taught us anything it's that the cover

648
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,056
It's like you don't want to give us your data

649
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,592
Let's go hack into your

650
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
Fiber optic

651
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,968
So in case there's a lot you can do

652
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,992
Except

653
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
Not have the stuff

654
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,344
I'm so you know there's also this idea that

655
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
Encryption is really your

656
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
Choice

657
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
So

658
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:10,048
If that's that's kind of demoralize I can sad because there are very few devices out there that are

659
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816
Being sold

660
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:17,216
It is that I think that's going to change over time but they're just going to be

661
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,800
Too much backlash over privacy in that people will not

662
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,872
Many people should say will not buy these devices

663
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
Unless they know their data is at least encrypted

664
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:30,528
So with that in mind as a consumer maybe start looking for things that are only in

665
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,600
As a journalist I'm going to start asking

666
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,904
A lot more questions about this

667
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Keep that in mind as I

668
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
Going to interview

669
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:44,608
Andrea's call who is the CEO of silk which is a company that makes the sense hub

670
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,656
And I will also say

671
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,216
Just for those of you guys who are out there and

672
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
Oh man

673
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
The netatmo gear

674
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,848
Which is from

675
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,640
That I know haha

676
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:00,992
They make a presence camera

677
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
Their stuff

678
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Is

679
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
It's all data

680
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,136
Stored on a physical device

681
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
Or that the presence camera is on

682
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,024
Is a camera where the data is stored on the device are on an SD card

683
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,304
Aldo store

684
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
The server

685
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
Have yours

686
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,960
So if your privacy-conscious this is a good device

687
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
Are you

688
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
Because

689
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,056
It stays in your home and in your network

690
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,104
I don't believe it's encrypted though

691
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
Well it's still a step

692
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,968
I had its that you're not relying on

693
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:38,880
The company is providing the service to actually store your data you can control your own server if you like whether it's encrypted or not

694
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,928
At least you know

695
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,768
You're managing it and that's another challenge to an obstacle but

696
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
Within your realm of

697
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
Patrol little bit more

698
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
Right and if you don't want to manage it UK

699
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
Okay

700
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,008
So now

701
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
We will

702
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544
Closeout

703
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,432
A Chia Pet show so much fun and information and we will go interview on Driscoll who is made this

704
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:08,064
Smart home hub and he is the former CTO of Mozilla so privacy is important

705
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,464
We are going to learn all about using actually facial recognition

706
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,864
Send to build a better smarter

707
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,912
Hey everyone welcome back

708
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:27,008

A Brand New Concept in the connected home

716
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,928
That is quite frankly beautiful

717
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
You better tell us what it is

718
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:52,864
Actually what you're trying to make is a device that can act as the ears and eyes and importantly the brain of your house

719
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:58,240
Respond to you and help you with all the it device.

720
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
Okay

721
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
So

722
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
It is

723
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,360
Fruit for you guys who are like there

724
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
Okay that sounds kind of cool

725
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,688
It is a smart home hub

726
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,248
It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

727
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
Has a camera

728
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,576
And it does image recognition

729
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,904
For me it when I saw it I was

730
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,000
So it's like the welcome camera combined

731
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,304
You know me software that like

732
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
Controls

733
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
All of your

734
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
Devices

735
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,888
Plus something else

736
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
And that something else is

737
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
Port of the IntelliJ

738
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
But

739
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,776
It's hot out so I haven't tried it

740
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
But

741
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,640
Your address is here to tell us kind of like

742
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
Why he built

743
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
So

744
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,968
Why are you guys doing this

745
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
Because

746
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,624
Excited about the potential

747
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,928
Listen to don't think such devices

748
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,232
But you're not really satisfied this is state

749
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
The art

750
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,536
As you can buy them in a store today

751
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,096
Something not intelligent and not responsive enough

752
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,120
You have to come home and

753
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,912
Use a smartphone to control your house

754
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
And said I want to come home and

755
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,984
I want my house to recognize me

756
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,824
That was the driving force behind making this device

757
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,128
It in the demos that I've seen it

758
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,456
Basically this thing when someone walks

759
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:17,344
I recognize this person's face and I know what they like and so I'm turning on their radio station

760
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,416
Nest thermostat to what they like and I'm playing their music

761
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
And

762
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
It's kind of cool

763
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
And

764
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:29,632
It kind of gets to this idea that I'm hearing a lot more from start-ups which is your smart home should be responsive

765
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
Not actually smart

766
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
Because smart is just like

767
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
It's not happening

768
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
Is that a fair assessment

769
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
Call from Santa

770
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
Smart

771
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
Wifi light bulb

772
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:49,600
W not smart at all they just remote controlled by a smartphone

773
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,160
Search for use of the word smart

774
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:56,256
Staying away from the term smarter than you use responsible for intelligent instead

775
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,560
Because the word smartass or overloaded

776
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:02,400
And used for devices that we don't leave receive a smart or intelligent

777
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:06,240
And you told me about your nest as an example of a first-generation

778
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:11,104
And if connected home product can you kind of talk to me a little bit about what a first gen

779
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,872
Product

780
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
Is an

781
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
Why that's a problem

782
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:18,528
Yeah so it was Nest devices

783
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
Until then

784
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,344
Some promised

785
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,672
This idea that the heating in your house will self-regulate

786
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:31,328
After that, said that's very much rooted is built on the Harborside

787
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,656
On the hardware side he was very simple sensors

788
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,936
Motion detector

789
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,752
How many people are in the room

790
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,800
And they cannot tell the people apart

791
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,336
O'mighty changing a second

792
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,104
On the nest

793
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,176
He doesn't bring enough

794
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,456
Different resources

795
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:54,112
Do they make Intelligent Decisions for you is be limited in this reflects often experience

796
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
Tell you that

797
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,416
The device canopy

798
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,000
Deborah heater a lot of people in the end and start using it

799
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:03,072
Beautiful Emmanuel and non smart thermostat

800
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:09,728
So you were telling me that you like your nest for example at 65 and your girlfriend likes it at 75

801
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,264
And so

802
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
From your disrespect

803
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,592
It just knows that there's this

804
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
Continuum Shift back and forth

805
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
Temperature

806
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,944
So for your device

807
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,992
It would know that

808
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,552
Not necessarily you but a person that looks like you

809
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,416
A person. Completely different person it would be changing the temperature because got the facial

810
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
Mission

811
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,512
I think that the first step to be able to solve

812
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
These problems

813
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Offer

814
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,888
Experiences for these devices to understand their surroundings

815
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:43,520
It's not enough that the motion sensor that tells you there's something moving a room just one or multiple people or pets

816
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,056
You have to have something in it

817
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,848
What happens around

818
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,408
So this is why they're bringing a lot of computational power

819
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,176
Miss Tobias

820
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
Camera in your room

821
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,576
I can see the individual of people there you can read recognize familiar people

822
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,112
It's a flex strangers

823
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:02,208
Information to use to make my own decisions for you

824
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
So then

825
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
That's the problem

826
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
Now how do you actually

827
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,864
If you were telling me with your girlfriend

828
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,424
The solution is its just 75 in

829
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,288
People that individual preference

830
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:21,152
Probably is until you have sufficient information to understand what's going on

831
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,456
You cannot offer any meaningful solution to this

832
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,784
Schedule nest if there's two people in the house that like different temperatures

833
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,576
Onesti's going to see that

834
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,624
The temperature has been set back and forth

835
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,648
Palio's

836
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:35,232
And then not be able to understand that this is because

837
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,328
Sometimes you're cool and sometimes you warm because two people fighting over thermostat

838
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
Soproxi the first episode

839
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,960
Increased amount of information is available to understand what's going on

840
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:49,312
In our case we can do the receipt that two different people are selling used to be different temperatures

841
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,480
Which one would you prefer to apply

842
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
Are the same time

843
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,624
Go Solutions

844
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,648
The previously

845
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,440
Penis

846
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,256
It goes back between two temperatures when sitting in the middle

847
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,792
Atlantic bullion happy

848
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
Got it

849
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,840
It's obb

850
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,632
Temperature may not be a great

851
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,424
Like example for this because it's pretty

852
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,704
Fighter you're either hot or cold

853
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,520
In a lot of ways you know where you can make everyone unhappy

854
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
What's the temperature at 7

855
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
You're too boring your girlfriend

856
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
Cold

857
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
But for things like

858
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,480
Lighting it might be really interesting because you know

859
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:33,088
Don't you see the whole family's coming home or maybe a bunch of strangers are over in your house can be lies

860
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,416
Maybe they're having a dinner party or maybe this is happy

861
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208
And then

862
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Does become

863
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
Interesting

864
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
It can make

865
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,304
With greater

866
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,096
Pieces of information that can make

867
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,144
Decisions that could be useful

868
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,192
So I like this

869
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
Now

870
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:54,592
With the idea of bringing facial recognition into it and having a camera that's something that people get freaked out of

871
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,152
So how are you going to dress ideas

872
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,968
Oh my God there's a camera in my house and

873
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,296
There's a whole search engine right now

874
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,576
People can have

875
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,648
Hack into cameras and that's freaking them out

876
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
I don't know

877
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
What about that

878
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
People in

879
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,488
They don't want their naked butts on the way

880
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,024
That's how you can sum up camera

881
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,048
People's houses right now

882
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:18,400
I can very much later that I spent the last seven years or so of my life

883
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,424
Looking for Missoula

884
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:24,032
Most recent technology

885
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,824
Important to me and

886
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,384
I'm very much worried about these developments

887
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,432
What's wrong with you by don't answer example

888
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,016
It's almost as if Google is moving in as your roommate

889
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,296
It's always watching you

890
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,928
420 concert yard

891
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:45,536
Spy camera devices

892
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:49,888
So this is one of the reasons that you put a lot of computational power into the device itself

893
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:53,728
Instabox able to do computer vision tasks locally in the device

894
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,056
I can talk to the cloud

895
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,872
But it does not have to send out the actual video stream

896
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,528
All your personal data on all the imagery stays inside your house

897
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,576
And advise maybe sense off bedtime for me

898
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,928
Notified When a Stranger is in your house

899
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,720
It's not recognized by the device

900
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,792
Analysis of all the pictures

901
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,072
But not send it to the cloud

902
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:23,168
The only thing that would be sent to the cloud is one actually financially if someone recognized

903
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:27,520
And a picture with not knowing who the Clown

904
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,640
Okay that's awesome so it has to have some Cloud connectivity

905
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:37,248
Could it be set up so there is no connect Cloud connectivity through like my own after

906
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
To be server or anything like that

907
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,112
Absolutely does not rely on the cloud at all

908
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
The demo that before you earlier

909
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,976
Actually it is complete

910
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,024
Because I didn't want to rely on

911
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,584
Current connectivity

912
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:55,936
Do you use for car connectivity

913
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
You can do that

914
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,264
Is it preferred that is completed

915
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,800
It's a possibility as well

916
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,848
Baby trying to put all the data

917
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,896
In your house after you control

918
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,432
You decide what happens

919
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,480
And you know we're going somewhere doesn't

920
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,040
Okay that's really promising

921
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,576
Cuz I know I got a lot of

922
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,112
I got a lot of people ask

923
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
Give me about

924
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
Good devices if there

925
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
Worried about that sort of

926
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,280
Is there a slot for an SD card if I want to save anything

927
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:31,264
SD card for internal storage

928
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:38,176
Device if you do that because someone can come in and steal the device in the new SD card is gone

929
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
Seth Rollins

930
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,344
Information that might affect your privacy so

931
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
Weekend

932
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,928
Not notify you and not store videos

933
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,232
The stranger the house at longer someone

934
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,256
Hungrier in the house

935
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:59,168
Limited to Simply if there's nobody know the device in the house and a stranger pops up then you can send a video clip to you

936
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,192
In stored in the cloud

937
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:06,592
Giving you so much better degree of course

938
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
What's happening around it

939
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
And how because

940
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:13,248
One of the things is the smarter these things get the more difficult it is

941
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
Programming

942
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,552
Or rather maybe it's

943
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
The Dumber they are the more difficult it is

944
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
How to program them

945
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,904
Because you're sitting here going

946
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,720
If this then that

947
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
My experience

948
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
Playing with a lot of my

949
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,376
So how is it that I am supposed

950
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
The program

951
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
This particular

952
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:37,568
Yeah so there such things as I think it's make it accessible to much broader range of people

953
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,200
Am I mature I'm smart enough to program is this my parents cannot do that

954
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,248
Technology that makes

955
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
Feast of Isis

956
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,576
Smart intelligent than accessible to everyone

957
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,488
You can sweetie program you don't have to program or device

958
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,096
Behaviors

959
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,680
The device essentially interacts with you and tries to learn your behavior

960
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
It's okay have to program it

961
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:09,056
Ability for developers to get access to the device and they can

962
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,872
Programs they can publish them in the marketplace

963
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,432
Would like these experiences

964
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,712
Meet Developers

965
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:21,088
What are consumed by consumers will Marketplace that's easier than having to program the device directly

966
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,672
It's similar to the way that you go to that Apple Store

967
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,208
ITunes Store

968
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,280
Will the Android Google Play Store on the smartphones

969
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:33,120
Top 10 new behaviors and new capabilities for your device

970
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,144
How to program that yourself

971
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,960
So you guys are releasing an SDK along with

972
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:41,312
Switches awesome you also are trying to build this app store mod

973
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,080
Which

974
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,384
Because I've been doing this for a really long time

975
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,272
I have heard before so I would love to understand because historically this hasn't worked as well

976
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
Partially because

977
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:55,136
The audience hasn't been big is very hard to make a market for this order

978
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,928
And also because

979
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,256
Actually supposed to because there isn't a huge market for a lot of these apps

980
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
Developers haven't slept

981
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,560
Because there is no mark

982
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,328
So

983
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,608
How are you guys going

984
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,912
Kind of seed this and how are you guys doing

985
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,008
Yeah so it's actually really right now there's more learning

986
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:15,360
Rotation this message right to really unlock what these experiences feel like

987
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,920
And the way you want to interact this is ontology

988
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,248
Cisco's device of Jamaica right now

989
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,784
It's not going to get the mouse Market

990
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,368
Is aiming in early adopters and developers who would like to learn the sauce

991
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:31,232
What are the right behaviors and what is intelligent behavior that they won't have home devices

992
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,512
Does Marketplace is not

993
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,840
Meant as a place right now to make money for us for fathers

994
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,888
Amen to the place where

995
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,680
Experience

996
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,472
Early adopters

997
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,312
The first McDonald in Estacada and learn how to program this device

998
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,176
Would like to

999
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,480
In the future when I come home and stop this happens for me

1000
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,576
But for soda coupons

1001
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:01,440
We can bring into existence today

1002
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,976
This is like a dream this Kickstarter

1003
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,536
Okay well I want to live in that world

1004
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
So

1005
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,680
If I want to live in that world today I would give you guys $249 I believe

1006
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,960
On Kickstarter

1007
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,032
And then I would get this when do you think it'll ship

1008
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,664
Century in Ventura

1009
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
And we have

1010
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,784
Designs that we will have a short video off on pages

1011
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,368
Tektronix and deductible design for this

1012
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:34,464
And they also fail far along the soffit pieces in the air show in a couple demo stuff that here and there

1013
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,024
Visol dated this year

1014
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,072
Okay I can't wait

1015
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,864
I definitely will

1016
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,424
I don't have a $250 for a hug

1017
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,728
Okay let me think about it

1018
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
I will think about it

1019
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,039
Especially the ones that you can buy today like

1020
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,831
It's a little thing at the hot in the closet

1021
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
End up

1022
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,695
It's necessary so some other device function

1023
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,047
Experience.

1024
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:13,375
I strongly believe in five or ten years all of us will experience today

1025
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:29,247
Given the nature of what it does I feel like I would have to have this piece of the future like in a couple rooms of my house

1026
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
Hold me back a little

1027
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,087
In the future you will

1028
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,367
Stop device like this

1029
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,183
He's got that ability some devices all around your house

1030
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:40,255
And Austin is not being dedicated devices

1031
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,351
4K TV these days too often with a camera built in

1032
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,911
Spy camera

1033
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,495
I sent you this is this is this technology

1034
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:55,359
We would like to help the industry

1035
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,455
Cameras and other sensors in there and also to visit in a better privacy

1036
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Preserving faith

1037
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:05,343
Today at countryview are using

1038
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,415
Even if you only have one device that you have purchased

1039
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
Kickstarter

1040
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,743
He might be able to see you only one room

1041
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:16,095
Signature if you're carrying a funeral miss you

1042
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,631
Let me know when you are home

1043
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,191
What can you use the house for another door because you Lucas

1044
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,751
So it is not

1045
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:27,103
Exactly the rolled in 5 or 10 years where there's a camera on a device I can every room

1046
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:33,759
And you to put this device in a prominent position in the living room

1047
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,831
Design it was a very nice appealing

1048
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,647
Physical design that fits into your life in your living room

1049
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,975
Is there a charge to put in a place where it can see you

1050
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:48,095
Got it yes I think I would rather trust you over you know baby Samsung

1051
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:52,447
Or any of the other big device manufacturers with a camera in my living room

1052
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,007
I mean we have a lot back on doing this

1053
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,543
I have done personally

1054
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,591
Missoula last 7 years

1055
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,919
Working on improving the state of privacy on the internet

1056
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,455
But you're not

1057
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,503
Because

1058
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,063
You seem to be more trustworthy than some others

1059
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,391
Fundamental design devices

1060
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,719
Technology that makes it impossible to get this wrong

1061
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,791
What are some things to do for the video streaming software example

1062
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,351
Is the device is a smartphone

1063
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,143
Using short distance

1064
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,959
Is Bluetooth called acacian to exchange cryptographic keys

1065
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:29,055
And then she can only be exchanged if you're very close physical proximity

1066
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
The device

1067
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,407
Only did that key on your smartphone can you ever watch

1068
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,199
A stream of the device

1069
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:41,087
Give me a shout when you're traveling

1070
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,671
Smartphones for direct physical proximity

1071
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,207
Wait to see that stream

1072
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,743
So it might seem

1073
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:53,887
Scary articles on my search engines for little things baking like watching other people's cameras by either

1074
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,679
Defective camera

1075
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,007
Or I'm flexible losing a password or someone guessing their password

1076
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,103
Search engine

1077
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,431
Because obviously Miss end-to-end encrypted between you and a smartphone

1078
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,967
Add devices in your house

1079
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,015
Okay that's a bold statement

1080
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,039
Maybe I will do

1081
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Okay

1082
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,623
Well thank you so much Andreas for coming on the show.

1083
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,415
Thanks very much

1084
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,719
That doesn't fit this week's episode

1085
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:25,119
Thank you for listening and please join us next week on the Internet of Things podcast
