14
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,760

The lovely afternoon in Helsinki Finland which is where I am this week

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,136
I am actually learning a lot about

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,464
Scandinavia region so you're going to do about it

53
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,512
Probably not to show cuz I'm a little jet lag

54
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,072

00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,936
This week it's been like next week in Stockholm

57
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
Week after that

58
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
Back it up

59
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,360
Let's kick it off this week Apple had a big announcement which I didn't even really

60
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,712
I was like I don't really need to watch this it is probably not to be hardware-related but

61
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
Attitude in

62
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
Husky

63
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
And

64
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,112
Really

65
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
Wall Street

66
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,208
Focus on the services Market

67
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,048
They offered a subscription service for newspapers newsletters and

68
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Others

69
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Subscriptions

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
And

71
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
There is now an app

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,960
And don't forget Apple arcade which is there

73
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:25,312
Subscription for $10 a month to play a hundred or more games

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,760
I did forget Apple arcade how dare I

75
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,040
That's all right

76
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,112
See this is this is why we work well together

77
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,720
They did have some Hardware came out the week before

78
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:47,584
And none of it was home care to where I accumulated which I think what kind of

79
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
Become numb to waiting for anything new there

80
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,984
Yes I'm not holding my breath

81
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
New and improved

82
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:01,920
Not the way we had hoped in her so we thought there would be more sensors health-related stuff it's really just

83
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:06,016
Minor improvements in the Bluetooth connectivity in the battery life and

84
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
Addition of wireless charging

85
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
I'll take what I can

86
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
In-ear devices

87
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,119
I would say apple probably isn't because there are devices out there that do offer any other headphones with

88
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,167
In your sensors and such but

89
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,263
Apple doesn't typically do things until they're ready to do it so clearly they weren't

90
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:34,431
This brings us back to something they did do a long time ago being the Forefront of digital assistants

91
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
And haven't done much sense

92
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
I saw this news tonight

93
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,903
What is all this mean for Siri in the homepod

94
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,719
With all of this Services strategy that Apple Isabel

95
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:56,191
I struggle to find really anything

96
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
Siri you're coming sure you can control your Apple TV music subscription and such

97
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
My voice

98
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
That's not new

99
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,967
There's nothing Hunt related here so that

100
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,527
Another got the homepod out there they seem to have

101
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,135
I want to say no dependents because clearly it's there on the market still on for sale but

102
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,439
Nothing new is happening with the homepod

103
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,279
Nothing really new is happening with Siri

104
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
2

105
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
There

106
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
Digital assistant

107
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,655
Or homepod with your services right now

108
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,215
And that's what kind of surprised me because

109
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,007
Amazon for example

110
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,591
Has historically made Amazon is the original

111
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:39,967
Delivers products from all over the place and it is a platform that I go to to find all kinds of crazy

112
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
And it's

113
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
Steadily increasing is

114
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,855
Scroll trying to take a cut out of every transaction

115
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
Jeff Bezos estate

116
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
And so

117
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
Insomuch as

118
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
You know we talked about it on the show

119
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
Amazon's digital assistant

120
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,423
It's not yet an integral part of Amazon strategy here

121
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,495
Amazon does have a strategy

122
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,567
Invoice shopping

123
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,383
Isn't so far gaining a lot of ground

124
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
But I do think it

125
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,759
Amazon is collecting device data

126
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
And getting it

127
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
Users

128
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
Comfortable with having

129
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,927
Advantage more and more of their lives

130
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:26,815
It soon it will manage their shopping or it might just make shopping easier through programs like

131
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Amazon

132
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,959
Which is where you have even let Amazon delivery folks into your home

133
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
If you have a certified Smart Lock

134
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
Camera

135
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,311
Orchestra Smart Lock

136
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,127
I think I agree with everything you said I think

137
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
Apple also is a middleman

138
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Poor

139
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Services

140
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
End

141
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
Purchases

142
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
In a different way

143
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,159
Mainly within its own ecosystem in a sentence

144
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,255
They obviously have third-party partners with absence on but they get a cut of everything

145
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,863
Everything you do Apple getting a cut of everything in the iOS ecosystem

146
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
And

147
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:06,751
They actually did expand beyond their ecosystem in one of their services

148
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,055
The Apple TV

149
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
Is coming to several

150
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
Smart TVs

151
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
So

152
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
The different way

153
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
Expand beyond their platform

154
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,343
We saw this with iTunes remember way back when

155
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,903
Finally did a Windows version of iTunes

156
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:31,327
Apple music which was originally beats music and started out on Android is obviously Apple

157
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,375
As well

158
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,959
So maybe they're just expanding to other platforms around inner

159
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Payment

160
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:42,335
Where is something like Amazon and Google is expanding

161
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Around

162
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
Their platform encompasses all kinds of other

163
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,223
Where is Apple's like new

164
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
Not going to do it

165
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Corral

166
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
Correct

167
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,111
There's no real crate answer here other than

168
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,159
The services strategy doesn't seem to

169
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
Incorporated

170
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Really at all

171
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,375
Apple is clearly not welcoming the open ecosystem that I think is necessary for this

172
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
Successful digital assistant

173
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,471
So I expect

174
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,591
Crummy experience there and double down on privacy as the reason

175
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,199
Yeah I think that's really good operating procedure for them right now

176
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,271
It was worth talking about since everyone loves Apple

177
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
I would say

178
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
Maybe not.

179
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
A fun topic

180
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
Cyber security

181
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
So this week

182
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:36,607
We got big news cyberex which is an industrial iot security startup they raised 18 million

183
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
Let it around led by Qualcomm

184
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
And even capital

185
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
Which is

186
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:50,431
In cigarettes is a company that I dealt with a lot they do a lot of reports around Industrial iot

187
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
Viruses malware bad practices all of this stuff

188
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
Business Development

189
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
It's pretty much a straight up

190
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Investment

191
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
We expect all the expansion

192
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:08,095
What's interesting about cyber X is it has focused

193
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
Almost entirely

194
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Industrial

195
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
Coyote and

196
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959
The software monitors net

197
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,751
Work traffic on equipment and then

198
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,823
Figures out what a normal data flow looks like

199
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,919
When the network traffic doesn't follow that behavior is

200
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
Wait

201
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
Weird data structures soy

202
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:32,159
If your industrial centrifuge start sending out weird versions of its data

203
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,951
Hyperx Cloud flight

204
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,767
And it also looks at who's access

205
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
Which individuals are a

206
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Accessing

207
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
The network

208
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,447
So it's a pretty broad array of things

209
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Consumers

210
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
But

211
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,055
The reason I pulled this funding is because

212
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
We're seeing a

213
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:55,967
Huge need for this as things come online and as things that will formally not connected

214
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
So

215
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,855
MIT technology review actually had a really good overview

216
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Triton

217
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Malware

218
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,207
It was first discovered on Schneider all

219
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Electric stuff

220
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,047
And basically attacks the safety

221
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,119
Systems of the programmable logic controllers

222
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
That sort of thing

223
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,263
Are these are the things that control the big honkin machines that run inside and

224
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
Industrial plant

225
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
And

226
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:25,407
Damn it story basically whatever I thought about Triton Triton

227
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
It's malware targets Industrial iot

228
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
I didn't think of it as

229
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
In quietness alarmist

230
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
Language in

231
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,415
MIT calls it the most murderous malware

232
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
Wow

233
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Yeah

234
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
It is designed

235
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,327
TLC's are for health and safety

236
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,167
Books for physical workers in the plant and also just for making

237
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
Plant

238
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
Operate as it's supposed to

239
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,567
So I guess in that sense yes you could blow up a plant

240
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,919
Getting a ride to Safety Systems which is what am I

241
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
Yard list

242
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
It's actually

243
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
Interesting to me that

244
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,879
First I was like why are companies like a cyber X looking at

245
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
Industrial only

246
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:13,023
But when you explain how it monitors for deviations in data and there were traffic

247
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
Total sense that companies like this

248
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
Focus on Industrial

249
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,263
Oversimplify things but in the smart home you've got so many variables

250
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,591
People searching different websites doing different activities etcetera

251
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
In a plant

252
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:32,479
Things should be doing the same thing mostly the same all the time

253
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,039
Innocent little easier to

254
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Detect

255
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:42,463
Or look for something is out of the norm I'm curious about what people will companies leaving smart home because of the wide

256
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Variables but

257
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
It just makes sense to me now

258
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
And that's a good one

259
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:52,447
That's not the only thing you should do with industrial iot security probably should have some auditability

260
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,543
Around your data that sort of thing and they're definitely companies providing that

261
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
There's several layers that

262
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,199
Coming to play the Cyber X definitely it's always one

263
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:09,855
The other story so Heather MIT technology review

264
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
Potential for harm

265
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
Prior to this

266
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Aluminum

267
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
Producer

268
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Can aluminum foil

269
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
Norsk Hydro

270
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Was struck by ransomware

271
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,631
We're in this ransomware actually

272
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,423
Shut the plant down in

273
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,287
Their losses this particular incident have reached

274
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,103
40 million US dollars

275
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
Crazy

276
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,223
Basically because their systems were attacked by the ranch

277
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,527
Swear they had to shut things down

278
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
And

279
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
They're gradually now ramp

280
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Production

281
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
So

282
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
There's a lot of question

283
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,303
Cyber X will software

284
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
In this case

285
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,399
If it started behaving weirdly I don't know if it would catch the

286
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,471
Before it launched the attack basically

287
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,287
Suspect not only because

288
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,615
Ransomware is a little bit different in that

289
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,015
It won't take actions like in a plant in like you know make a plant grow up instead somebody

290
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,319
Has access to take control of the system

291
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:18,463
And can bring shut it down and say I'm not turning back on $1000000 or whatever it is

292
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,303
Yeah and you don't even have to attack the actual physical

293
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,607
Plant infrastructure

294
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,167
Computers Lakewood database

295
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,751
There's to This shows

296
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
Two different vectors of attack

297
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
Equally catastrophic

298
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
I shouldn't say

299
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Because you know obviously

300
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,711
Oil refinery exploded in spew toxic gases everywhere

301
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
People that is

302
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,319
That's much worse than not having enough Coke cans to

303
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
But

304
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,927
From a company in an economic perspective

305
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,463
Attacks

306
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
Are things you really

307
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:57,375
So it was worth talking about just to kind of drive home how important cybersecurity

308
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,471
Even an industrial system

309
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
Which may not be connected to the internet

310
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,871
Nation states and other hackers are targeting

311
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
Comes as well

312
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
And so

313
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,503
It's going to get really interesting

314
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,159
Another security over to the Smart Home

315
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,487
Which makes a mesh wi-fi system

316
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:29,119
They announced their own security service

317
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,423
A couple weeks back it was not surprising

318
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Because

319
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,751
Pretty much everybody else Comcast

320
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Euro

321
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
Other companies I can't think of right now

322
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,431
I'll have these types of services and usually monitoring your network traffic

323
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
They're saying hey

324
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
Your thermostat probably should not be talking

325
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
That's weird

326
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
Shut that down

327
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,415
Who doesn't have one

328
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,767
What doesn't have parental controls

329
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Add-on subscription type

330
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,863
Security service

331
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:05,727
It does have security features such as parental controls and guest networks and all

332
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,031
But what you're describing from plume

333
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
I don't know

334
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,711
The Google I've never heard Google talk about I'm sure you know I just don't know there's there's no mention of

335
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,759
Any over and above tech security

336
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
Here's the question

337
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,855
A lot of these services

338
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
Are predicated on the idea

339
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:28,511
Their services through a service provider and they're also boxes

340
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
Norton has one of his cloak

341
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
Core

342
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,631
These are like this and you can buy them

343
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
My question is

344
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,447
Do we really need

345
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
In

346
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
So far

347
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:44,127
The answer based on my eye so I got the Eero service just to see what it would look

348
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,175
The answer seems to be no

349
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,735
The things that are getting attached

350
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
Are my computers and

351
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
IPhones

352
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
B

353
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,159
I hope you saw not so much a part of it is because I tend to buy

354
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,719
Decent stuff I don't put weird

355
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
Beauty Brands in my house

356
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
I know some companies

357
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:07,679
Some of the more well-known iot companies they're actually proactively doing network monitoring

358
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
So

359
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,567
Me doing it as just another layer in in another saying that

360
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
I am just one person

361
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,175
This is all anecdotal this is not actually true data

362
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,527
But so far I haven't seen an attack stops that would really

363
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
Warrant

364
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:29,183
Paying for this I think the Avalon of

365
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Okay

366
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
See that's what I think is

367
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,839
Missing

368
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
And your question about

369
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,935
Is a reason necessary I don't know the answer that question

370
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,007
That's probably more about personal Comfort level thing

371
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,079
But I just went to the Google Wi-Fi security features webpage

372
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,687
Firewall WPA2

373
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,991
Automatic updates and TLS

374
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Communication

375
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,623
There's no network monitoring mentioning or anything like that

376
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
Centris

377
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
Probably do it

378
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,511
Civil engineering

379
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
They're pretty smart people

380
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,863
So in some ways I think this is

381
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
This could be two things

382
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,727
136

383
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,055
To get you to buy a subscription

384
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,151
And is falls into the need for a subscription Revenue source.

385
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
The product

386
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
Cuz they're trying to continually update these things

387
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,783
They're trying to add you services

388
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Viable to

389
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,159
So include for example his talked about adding a subscription fee

390
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
For it

391
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
Devices

392
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Which

393
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,887
So this could just be a way to legitimize charge

394
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
4

395
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
Charging people

396
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
Could be an N actually with

397
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:51,871
You have zero your house I think you pay what $10 a month for similar service

398
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Yes

399
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,991
How is $60 for the years of $5

400
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
Yes but

401
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
I do get a blocking

402
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
I get it

403
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
VPN

404
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Password

405
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,951
I probably get a pony that I haven't paid for

406
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,743
I have it actually picked up yet I do

407
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,303
You got horny and you get a pony

408
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
So

409
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,703
I don't know I'm not sold

410
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
I'll be real here

411
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Nothing

412
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
I think a lot of our listeners

413
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:25,151
Just based on comments on the website and enter voicemail

414
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:30,527
They actually are concerned again I think it's a personal choice and I think it's probably

415
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
Protective than not

416
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,903
But I don't pay for Energy Services that's just me personally

417
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
Get off work

418
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
Go for it

419
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,327
I just turn my lights off

420
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
Not again

421
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
All right

422
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
Let's talk about chips

423
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,263
At music which is a car in California

424
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
Powered

425
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
SOC use for the

426
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
Internet of Things

427
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,223
Solar powered

428
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
That

429
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,087
You can put into an iot device and

430
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
I love all of you

431
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,791
It's basically the reason you basically designed a chip that could run

432
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,351
Bluetooth radio in a small application

433
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
Very very very low power

434
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,959
And idea was you could

435
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
Battery

436
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,567
Small TV

437
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
TurboTax

438
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,127
And we just run forever

439
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,175
And that apparently is what they have.

440
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
I wrote about them a couple months ago

441
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
High School start

442
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,111
6 smart for them to combine photo photovoltaic and in there

443
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,671
Article on demand wake up Technologies

444
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:45,535
They say I say

445
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,327
200 times lower power

446
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Then other

447
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,887
Relating of similar Champs

448
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Sound

449
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,215
And it basically the idea here is

450
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
If you're going to have a sensor

451
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,407
And you're going to have a billion

452
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,455
You cannot be changing their batteries all the time

453
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,991
You just got to set it and forget it

454
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
And that

455
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
What does technology could help

456
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
Let's talk about

457
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
Robot

458
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:19,327
Which of course I love to talk about so I was very interested in this

459
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
A story from earlier this week

460
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,423
Google AI blog

461
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,983
Showing off the lot

462
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:30,591
Which is exactly what it sounds like

463
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,663
Initially the robot did not know how to

464
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,711
Toss the right items into

465
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,271
The appropriate bin when sorting things

466
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,599
But using Google's AI

467
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,415
About ten thousand grass and throw attempts

468
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,975
14 hours that took of training time

469
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
They now

470
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,327
Show that the passing by has four C's of

471
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
Up to 85%

472
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
And

473
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,959
That's amazing to me because in such a short time

474
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:02,079
This arm has learned how to properly sort things into the right boxes

475
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,151
Certified cell phone by analyzing

476
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,687
Results over time

477
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,991
Ann supervised learning

478
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,319
That's what I do everyday unsupervised learning

479
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,903
I just think about you all these massive warehouses where we have

480
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,488
People going around

481
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
Turn on the picking

482
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
Of products and what not

483
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,400
I know they've got some robots in those warehouses and all but when you start combining

484
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:31,776
The mobility of a robot then with the self-learning of hay and I can go pick this product I know where it is

485
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,056
Yes ma'am

486
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,456
Just think about it and recycling right now

487
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
Like a huge percentage of recycling isn't sorted correctly so if we can somehow automate that so people don't have to

488
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
To do it

489
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:51,744
Cuz it's like Yaki job no one really wants it

490
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,840
We could actually lower the total cost of recyclables Witchwood

491
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
Presumably

492
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,912
Encourages to recycle more

493
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Yay

494
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,496
Absolutely there's a lot of potential here

495
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:07,872
Any of the downside is that there are currently people that have jobs that do these types of things

496
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,176
Honest I think people could probably better spend their

497
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
Doing other things

498
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
So I love this

499
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
They should start a podcast

500
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
It's all the rage

501
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
All right

502
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Hey

503
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,440
Other robots these robots are flying robot

504
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
Yes

505
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:27,072
You saw the UPS Now using drones for medical Palos

506
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
I did

507
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,400
Does this mean I get my new kidney deliver via drone

508
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,472
It wouldn't be delivered to your home

509
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,848
The Drone could actually deliver to the hospital if you're getting a kidney transplant

510
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
Absolutely

511
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,968
There are some limitations here granted this is all part of

512
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,528
Under the FAA as well just got approval

513
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
I should say that

514
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,856
Test program right now but

515
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
The drowning

516
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,464
Paramedical payloads up to about 5 lb

517
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,512
So maybe a couple kidneys on

518
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,840
Over distances up to about 12 and a half miles so

519
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,144
Specific

520
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,960
But lots and lots of potential in a very

521
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,544
Time efficient manner for something that mean when you need

522
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,640
Say that kidney or a heart or whatever it might be

523
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:17,504
When you see the kidney call UPS

524
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,808
It's a very specialized but important

525
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
I'm having impactful

526
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
Project right now

527
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,160
Yeah I just looked at the

528
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:30,048
Average weight of an adult human kidney is a quarter pound

529
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:31,840
Dry ice

530
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
Whatever

531
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
I don't know how to dress

532
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,984
Order 3 and get a discount I mean come on

533
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
Free shipping

534
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312
This makes a lot of sense

535
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
Especially in

536
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Anybody who set

537
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,664
Just in New York or San Francisco traffic

538
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,480
Literally literally

539
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,600
What else

540
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
Oh

541
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,672
Speaking of New York City

542
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:00,000
Police Department is using AI to detect

543
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
Crime

544
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
Patterns

545
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
Which

546
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
You seem very excited by this

547
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:12,032
Interesting and obits

548
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,128
Yeah but the New York Police Department Ashley

549
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
Said this month that they're using

550
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,200
Attract

551
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,736
Crimes and Spa

552
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,320
They've been doing it since late 2016 which I found

553
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,856
Very interesting

554
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
They call this

555
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,464
Modernizr is not obviously spelled correctly

556
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,768
Starts up things in spells incorrectly so

557
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,072
Nicr after the work pattern

558
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:41,216
There's some people who are rightly concerned about racial biases being reinforced

559
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,288
It's going to open up things to a lot of

560
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,312
Scrutiny

561
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,384
Make the world

562
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,432
I think we're going to see very starkly

563
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
We have

564
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,064
Structured our society disadvantage some people over others

565
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
And

566
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,672
I think when put in very black-and-white terms through

567
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,208
Data analysis

568
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:06,304
Will no longer be able to lie to ourselves and say that this is an individual's fault

569
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,632
And we'll have to start looking at culpability of us as a society

570
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,704
Which could be interesting or we could just shrug our shoulders

571
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,080
I will say even though I think I should have disclosed this making 2016

572
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,640
The police department is taking up

573
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:24,480
Slow approach in using us because they're not

574
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
Using it for crimes

575
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
Such as

576
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Recent homicides

577
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,648
They are basically using to track petty larceny is to

578
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,000
Ingest data and gather analyzing and so on so

579
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,072
That's probably wise but

580
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,888
Doing the wrong thing

581
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,168
The measured approach

582
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,960
Speaking of data

583
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
McDonald's

584
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
Smitty big acquisition

585
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
Yes

586
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
McDonald's is acquiring dynamic

587
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
Which

588
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,248
Analyzes

589
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,528
Names of data

590
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,112
Drive-thru

591
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,136
UPS

592
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
A product

593
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
Based on

594
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,464
Weather time of day

595
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,488
What you ordered

596
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,352
Yeah it's rather smart use of external data

597
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
What happens at the drive-in

598
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,544
Define often

599
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,080
I don't know once a week

600
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Once a month

601
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,808
I go there too often

602
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,624
Bentley and publicly minutes and that's all I'm going to say on that

603
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,696
Okay Kevin I would like you

604
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,720

00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,840
Offered and let's see how that changes over

607
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,888
I go for testing purposes

608
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,936
There you go see now you have a reason to

609
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,704
Other than

610
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
All right

611
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,824

636

This week's question is

637
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
From Joe

638
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Let's hear it

639
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,104
Hello Stacy and Kevin

640
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,128
This is Joe

641
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,432
And you may use the song the show

642
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,248
I recently had motorized

643
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,040
Z-Wave window blinds

644
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
Install

645
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,904
And was able to connect them to my wake up without problem

646
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,464
However I was disappointed

647
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,256
That the Amazon Echo

648
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
Discover.

649
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:22,400
I was hoping for them to be found at least that's what you heard Z-Wave device

650
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
They could be voice

651
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
Bald

652
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,984
To turn on off

653
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
Raise or lower the blinds

654
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,104
And I could find no related madam

655
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
Skill

656
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
La poblana

657
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,200
Manufacturers Graber

658
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,760
Z-Wave motor by others

659
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
Valley Football

660
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,112
I was wondering if you had any tips or tricks

661
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,208
To get the echo to recognize the Z-Wave motor

662
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Text

663
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,280
Ojo I have been there

664
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:54,912
Exactly where you are now I have connected my selfie blinds to my wink home hub

665
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,960
And I did it in a weird way

666
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
As a zwave device and

667
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,080
Not only can I not connect it to Madame a

668
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,360
I also

669
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,896
Have it backwards

670
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,176
So instead of

671
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,480
Can I say open the blinds in the app

672
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,784
It actually closes the blinds in real life

673
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,320
Is apparently unknown

674
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,856
Law that happens to Lots

675
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,904
Yay

676
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,696
But isn't that what you're asking

677
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,488
You would like for it to work with Madam a

678
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,024
And here we have good news

679
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,376
Yeah the good news is you can get it working with Madam a

680
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,912
Will Google home if you prefer

681
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:32,544
The bad news is you can't do it with have to do it with SmartThings

682
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
So yes unfortunately

683
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:38,176
That's because the way wink

684
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,736
Actually sees that device just

685
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,552
Treats it as

686
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
It's a generic Z-Wave

687
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,672
And the challenges wink support

688
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,000
Madame only for supported

689
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
Lights

690
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
So

691
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
You can do a lighting shortcut

692
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,400
As long as the lights are supported in granted

693
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
Youku

694
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:03,008
Make your Z-Wave device look like a light but it still isn't

695
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Supported by

696
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,056
So it won't actually work

697
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:10,432
Right and technically it doesn't quite work with SmartThings

698
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:15,552
Unless you actually change it to a dimmer switch in SmartThings there's

699
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:20,416
A device Handler that that handles this so you don't even have to change it to a dimmer switch

700
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
Install that and so on

701
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,792
So you can change it to a dimmer switch

702
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,096
Things and then it would work

703
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:33,472
That's a terrible answer because I know you have as well

704
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:38,336
Unfortunately you know it's not crazy expensive I think it's 99 bus right now

705
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,896
Sometimes it's even as low as 70

706
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:45,760
Right now I mean actually mine cortical SmartThings Hub cost me $10 because

707
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,320
I bought the USB SmartThings link

708
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,112
Spectacles into an Android TV

709
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
So

710
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
That made it a hub

711
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
I think that was

712
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
Especially

713
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,280
Because they like me

714
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
No like it was like the holidays

715
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:04,448
So they don't like me I think you're right it maybe like 30 or $40 that USB stick

716
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,776
I don't know their opinions on you kept sorry

717
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,896
For the day sorry about that

718
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
And

719
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:19,296
You know you can maybe you'll just invest in the Ikea blinds when they come out in August

720
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
Stand

721
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,600
That should work

722
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,880
With Madeline

723
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:29,792
I would replace my Hub before I replace my blind cuz I have a feeling those blinds for the motor for that probably wasn't going to

724
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,560
Expensive

725
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
That is true

726
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
That's why I'm still stuck with

727
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
Janky setup

728
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
Psy

729
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
All right

730
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,008
Well that's it for that

731
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:43,616
Time to Say Goodbye Tevin and then hear from our guest Steve Mueller

732
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:47,200
Who is the head of innovation at Fort Rock we're going to be talking about

733
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,272
Why you won't be entering as many passwords

734
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
In the near future

735
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,624
You

736
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
The first

737
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,208
A message from our sponsor

738
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,768
This week sponsor is a pharaoh

739
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:09,728
Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from this week's podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is a

740
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,032
Pharaoh and I have a pharaoh CEO

741
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
Jailbreak

742
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
Here to talk to us

743
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,896
Data and AI

744
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:21,760
So Jo you and I've been having a series of conversations including on Topix

745
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,296
Bank of things

746
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:27,392
Using Bluetooth low energy to create a secure payment platform

747
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,720
And the platform approach to iot

748
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:34,560
And this week I'd love to talk about data analytics and AI

749
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:35,840
But first

750
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,912
Would you remind our listeners what it is that a pharaoh does

751
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:44,800
Yeah a pharaoh provides and iot platform that simplifies how you connect anything to the internet

752
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,104
We can help you build business cases take you

753
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
You all the way through roll out

754
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,200
Mongoloid management of your entire fleet of devices

755
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
As well as data analytics

756
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,624
Customers tell us that a pharaoh is the best choice for into end-user experience and developer productivity

757
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,416
And it's also beautiful design

758
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
Really easy to use

759
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
Fast

760
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,744
And very very secure

761
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:09,376
SoJO there's no AI without data increasingly there's not enough data without iot

762
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:13,216
So can you explain for us the relationship between these two

763
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Concepts

764
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
Why do we care about art

765
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,896
Machine learning AI ultimately gives us insights that we can use to achieve objective

766
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:24,736
But what do we have to feed a i with we have to feed it with structured data

767
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:31,136
And where does that structure data come from what comes from anywhere anything that can generate in one of the biggest problems that we have with

768
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
IRT

769
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:36,000
Is structuring the date of the right way many other iot Solutions

770
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,792
Allow the developer to just

771
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
Send free form data up to

772
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,376
The cloud the hazard with

773
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:47,520
Yes is that the developer doesn't always think through how the data should be structured to best serve

774
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,592
Artificial intelligence engine and without that

775
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,872
Planning and forethought

776
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,408
It's very easy

777
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,432
To create

778
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,224
A huge amount of data

779
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,528
But either has to be normalized before

780
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,808
Can be used by AI

781
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Or in the worst-case

782
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
Just can't be used at all

783
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,904
So a pharaoh takes a different

784
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Approach

785
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,696
How does a pharaoh

786
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
In many a i

787
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
What's the date of that you're dealing with

788
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,816
Comes without much contacts

789
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Attached to it

790
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,632
Now she wants may be aware of the contacts

791
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
But the metadata to do

792
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
Describe it just isn't there

793
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,216
The best possible

794
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,520
What solution is to have what we call structured data

795
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,360
Where there's a data schema in each field is labeled and understood

796
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
From the outset

797
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,224
Affero guides the developer through giving

798
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,760
Each captured data element

799
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,784
That needed Kant

800
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
In this way

801
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,112
Data captured using a pharaoh

802
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:40,256
Is already ready to be used with AI machine learning and also used in conjunction with other structured data sources

803
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:45,632
These have been great before we go please remind us where people can go to

804
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,168
To get more information about it

805
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
You can always go to

806
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,752
Acero. IO

807
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,544
/ Go - big

808
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,568
As a great place to start

809
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,104
If you're a developer

810
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,664
Check out developer. Afero. IO

811
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,016
And you can check out all the resources that we have on a pharaoh. IO

812
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:13,792
Would welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

813
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:18,656
Is Eve Baylor who is VP of innovation and emerging technology

814
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
At Fort Rock

815
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,472
Hi and how are you doing

816
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,544
I'm great thanks Davie High everybody

817
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
So

818
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,336
She

819
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:30,944
If you guys haven't recalled she was on the show before probably about a year ago and we talked about

820
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
Identity

821
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,296
And I really thought we have to solve this problem by now but

822
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
I still have so many

823
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
Passwords so

824
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,928
Much difficulty logging on two devices

825
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,232
Multiple times in a month

826
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,048
I'm actually getting more frustrated not less

827
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
So

828
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,840
We're going to talk about

829
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,400
Why that is and maybe some of the

830
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
Technology

831
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
That might help make it better

832
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,728
That sound good

833
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,288
Yeah yeah

834
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:01,152
Year people been working on it for maybe 15-20 years

835
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,968
By golly these are smart people they should be here by now

836
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:08,832
We've solved all kinds of other problems I feel like the best place to start is to break down

837
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,904
Infer definition

838
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,488
Thanks when I think about logging into things and lie, that's my identity on these devices

839
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,304
Nope that's Authentication

840
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,096
So let's tell me the difference between the two

841
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888
So you know

842
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,680
Identity

843
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,776
The information that represents you that the stuff that's true

844
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
Entrusted

845
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,080
About you

846
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,664
Authentication is the active

847
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,256
And what the companies that want you to prove that you're you to them want to do with that information

848
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
Is

849
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
Experience

850
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,864
And give you a personalized experience

851
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,728
And they want your partner in this

852
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,544
Help you pay for things that help you have

853
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,336
An experience that is connected

854
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
It can happen

855
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,624
Continuously

856
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
The beginning of

857
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,536
Quicken YouTube about username and password

858
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,352
Stop music at the beginning of a session

859
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
At least

860
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,448
With that company that were having a digital experience

861
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,776
Okay let's talk about that because this was an article that

862
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,056
Really resonated with me

863
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
With my

864
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,640
I don't know 60 some-odd devices in my house and

865
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,200
And I am constantly being asked to

866
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,272
Authenticate myself to them

867
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,624
What is going on in this article the writer promise

868
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Outline the problem

869
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:51,232
And then he said but guys it's going to get better cuz we have new standards

870
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,000
It's coming along

871
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,304
So explain to me

872
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,328
First

873
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,376
Why all these companies need me to like

874
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
Constantly login

875
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
Account goodlord

876
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:04,288
Yeah it is it is kind of constant cuz there's so many companies

877
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:10,432
He did mention that a sign in with Facebook button how he's never going to do it

878
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
Do that

879
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,736
And that enables

880
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,344
Companies

881
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,624
Multiple town

882
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
So when I login with Facebook and Google then they get all that

883
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
Data about

884
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,232
Where I'm going right

885
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,536
David that where you're going

886
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:29,376
And the companies that leverage that's fine with whoever button

887
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,656
They're getting data

888
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:38,848
Units of mutual benefit for Facebook on Google

889
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,872
And then

890
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,920
You get the benefit of having service

891
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
Easier sign in

892
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
Experience

893
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,832
I guess you could say the mutual benefit all around but there's also some privacy

894
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:53,696
Yeah I'd rather use like a password manager or maybe have

895
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
Chrome

896
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
12 Chrome keeps my

897
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
Information that I've shared

898
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
Google

899
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,936
Give you the choice of buying with Facebook as a button

900
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,960
Versus

901
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:10,336
You know creating a whole new password and you know not using

902
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:14,944
It's good to have a choice because

903
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,968
Puppies

904
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,040
And I tend to be more private

905
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:24,160
And not take that off

906
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,464
The author the Facebook of the Google button

907
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,864
So I tend not to use that because I don't want to share Facebook information with Google information

908
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,240
Calling again

909
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,896
It really is an authentication problem

910
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,176
Enter

911
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,016
And you don't want any friction and entering the Third

912
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,088
Enough work another solution to the problem

913
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,440
India password manager

914
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
People

915
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:02,560
Often times I recommended on data privacy day

916
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:06,144
When everybody I'm not a security professional

917
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,912
Professional

918
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
Well you know

919
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,824
Password managers that can help you in a reduced fraction

920
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
Okay

921
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,664
In that particular article this is not the solution they talk

922
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,272
What about coming to save us all from the charity of having eight thousand

923
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
And remembering them all

924
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
Edamame

925
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:25,856
So

926
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,232
New standard actually called

927
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,024
Web

928
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,072
Uth which was

929
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:38,912
Sedimented into the World Wide Web Consortium

930
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,776
And that is helping you too

931
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,568
More

932
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
Including some biometric

933
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,712
Indication

934
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,784
Fingerprint

935
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,064
Facial recognition

936
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,112
Into the browser

937
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,392
Which is where we have

938
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
Call me

939
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,768
And so

940
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,584
Standardization

941
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,984
As of last week and the browser makers have been fighting

942
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,264
Watershed forgetting

943
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,568
Stronger methods

944
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,360
Username password

945
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,640
To be supported

946
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,200
That's actually really good

947
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,528
The future of Authentication

948
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,928
Let's talk about this a little bit because there's things that need to happen for

949
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
45802

950
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:34,976
1

951
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,536
People have to implement it on the browser side

952
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,304
End

953
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
On the

954
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,400
Application side or is there device side

955
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
Aspects like

956
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,240
What needs to happen for phyto to actually

957
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,568
Work for an individual or an individual's device

958
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,360
And then the second thing is

959
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,895
It's only works right now

960
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,431
Browser-based

961
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,967
And so what is that

962
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,807
The biggest

963
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,623
I would say I've been

964
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
Browser maker

965
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,207
Powerful

966
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743
Do what they want

967
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
And

968
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,303
Getting browser

969
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
Change

970
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,631
I was going to be?

971
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,495
Absorb

972
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,175
I think that this barrier is going to fall

973
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,759
In the case of

974
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,063
Applications

975
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,487
NetSpend

976
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,279
Tazewell Virginia

977
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,303
And I think that we can

978
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,935
Master cycle of incorporating

979
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,727
Then we can expect

980
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,103
Generally what we see is that

981
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
I can't rely on

982
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,527
Smartphones and applications on mobile devices

983
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,831
I think I'll be able to take advantage

984
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
Okay so I could have

985
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
This additional at

986
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
Application even

987
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743
If I'm signing in

988
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,791
Okay

989
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,839
So here's where things get

990
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
Billy fun

991
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,911
Not only am I asked like

992
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,959
Buy devices to Lake login

993
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:25,311
Things like I've let you out for your own safety which is fine I get it

994
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,359
So I'm logging into individual apps

995
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
But then

996
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
Another layer

997
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:33,759
Sometimes I want to link my apps together so I'm like a

998
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,319
Nest I want you to talk to my Amazon Echo

999
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
Intend

1000
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,671
That goes like hey you got insert your

1001
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
Nest password

1002
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,719
And I'm like okay

1003
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,511
Back and forth I go

1004
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,583
So I I look at things like that is that something that

1005
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,631
I should see get better here

1006
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,239
I think it will get better and me article

1007
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,775
YouTube

1008
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,079
So

1009
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
Cookies

1010
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,431
People now know about cookies I think

1011
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,271
Gdpr apocalypse

1012
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,623
Yes I accept cookies in my browser

1013
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,671
Equivalent

1014
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,719
When it comes to anything.

1015
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,095
Typically what apps do

1016
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,167
The best possible experience

1017
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,983
It has tokens

1018
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
Forever

1019
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,591
This is why things that aren't

1020
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,151
Birthday your bank app

1021
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,943
Can't believe me just watch

1022
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,783
I think about my

1023
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,743
Right I think of a token like a

1024
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,767
The key to my house

1025
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:52,351
I'm going to give it to someone and then I'm going to revoke it after a certain set

1026
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
Because

1027
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,911
You should know

1028
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,959
That's what I thought

1029
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,527
And you could have a vehicle

1030
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
You

1031
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,087
Could have somebody else using

1032
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,879
Typically

1033
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,415
Mobile devices

1034
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Anthony

1035
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,303
Other kinds of

1036
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
Connected

1037
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,351
Smart devices

1038
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,407
Very short life

1039
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,479
And that's where tokens really don't want to be what I call

1040
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,087
Naughty forever

1041
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:50,463
Password list

1042
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,727
Do

1043
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,519
Authentication using

1044
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,151
All kinds of things

1045
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,943
Sky's the limit

1046
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,479
Indication

1047
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,135
True I would love my daughter loves to take my Fitbit

1048
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,183
When I'm having a shower or some

1049
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,463
Michelle Financial take it

1050
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,511
I would love for it to be like

1051
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Hey

1052
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,303
You're not Stacy

1053
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,607
No I'm not looking

1054
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
It doesn't have

1055
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,655
But that's okay

1056
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,935
This is not a highly secure

1057
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Pair device

1058
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:33,983
But I see what she

1059
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
But

1060
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,799
The flip side of that is

1061
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,615
Because I Am The Keeper of the passwords

1062
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:42,943
On all of our connected home devices I'm also like

1063
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,783
I'm basically like the person everyone calls on when

1064
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:50,879
When stuff goes wrong or things get unlinked need to be reeling

1065
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:55,743
And you know it's a multi-user environment and sometimes I wish that we had a way of

1066
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
Authentication

1067
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,095
You know everybody who belongs in the environment with admin rights

1068
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,167
That is like a whole nother level of complex

1069
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
I'm curious what you have

1070
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
How to say about that

1071
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,055
Absolutely

1072
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,103
I can show you that

1073
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,151
Small slice

1074
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,223
The identity challenge with large

1075
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,527
Talking about it

1076
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,575
What is a delegate

1077
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,135
If you think about it

1078
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,951
What what I'm shorthanded as identity is really

1079
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,999
Identity and access management

1080
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:35,423
IT staff to manage

1081
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
My house I don't

1082
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
I don't know

1083
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:40,799
That's exactly what I am

1084
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,735
And exactly what

1085
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,527
How to do

1086
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:54,367
Enterprise I am contact you don't want to

1087
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,927
Because you don't want to turn

1088
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,463
Regular people

1089
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,767
System administrator

1090
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,631
In a lot of people are

1091
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,751
Men should have to run like active Direct

1092
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,823
That's

1093
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,895
So what is the solution here

1094
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:21,247
The concept of number of people have been working on for a long time

1095
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,343
Identity relationship manager

1096
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,927
It really isn't your grandfather's I am

1097
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,207
You know

1098
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:32,255
What does

1099
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,535
How many light bulbs

1100
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
Are you there

1101
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
Cousin

1102
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,191
Last time I talked to you I live in a tiny apartment

1103
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,215
Stillhouse

1104
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,239
I got you

1105
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,311
Security

1106
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,175
Delegating

1107
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,903
Somebody

1108
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,439
To some

1109
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,975
Stagnant

1110
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,535
My home

1111
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,839
I really want to do it by 4

1112
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,143
Function they have in my life

1113
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,191
Function.

1114
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,983
Having my life

1115
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,799
The role that they have

1116
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:22,943
And you know Enterprise I am we would talk about roll management

1117
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,015
Explosion murder house

1118
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,879
Control

1119
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,647
So

1120
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,927
Identity

1121
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,255
You can actually

1122
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:39,071
Keep it under control by thinking about

1123
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,351
Other people

1124
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
Glasgow

1125
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:56,991
Cicadas noise

1126
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
Google search

1127
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
Facebook

1128
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:09,535
Like I have a

1129
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,351
Because I did something wrong

1130
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
I can

1131
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,335
You can actually do it

1132
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,615
In

1133
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,175
That would be automatic is part of the

1134
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:31,807
Device in the app that's associated with that device or is that part of my management panel that's coming with me

1135
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,343
Echo or my

1136
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,391
Hub how do I get this magic

1137
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,303
How you could do this

1138
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,679
Benefit claims and prescription information

1139
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:50,239
Data

1140
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,151
Standard and standard

1141
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,647
Connected and disconnected and paired and unpaired

1142
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
The standard

1143
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
And

1144
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,631
Identity relationship

1145
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,655
Enter people

1146
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
Deploying

1147
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,471
Actually they are

1148
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:24,031
Example is a mandate in the UK

1149
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,847
4 - 4

1150
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,639
People who are

1151
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,199
Multiple pension accounts

1152
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:35,551
And pension pick up like in your 401k

1153
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,831
So they're working

1154
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,903
To the toy how you would aggravate

1155
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:47,839
To somebody like that and we're working with

1156
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,007
Dashboard console

1157
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,895
So I would probably see my smart home hub people

1158
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:06,015
Adopt something like this if I wanted to implement this kind of awesome automatic relationship management

1159
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,551
Based on graph

1160
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
In my home

1161
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,903
So as a consumer the sounds awesome

1162
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,695
Can't wait for it to be on the horizon

1163
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,487
What hope do I have

1164
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,047
For making my life easier in the short-term

1165
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,095
In the short-term

1166
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,375
Turn still

1167
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,399
Going to be

1168
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:25,215
As many accounts of people have to login to

1169
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,239
In the very short of

1170
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,007
Turn

1171
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,567
I do advise people to use password manager

1172
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,103
Some people will be

1173
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,639
Incentivize to you

1174
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,783
And it's up to each individual person to

1175
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,319
Decided

1176
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,087
Privacy

1177
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,095
That's inside if you're willing

1178
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,375
Official finding or not

1179
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,935
And how you're going to manage all those accounts

1180
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,959
But

1181
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,079
Identity is not authentication alone

1182
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,871
Multiple

1183
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,639
Think about

1184
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,431
What identity baijiu

1185
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
Identity

1186
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,503
Coming to get protection

1187
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,295
Personalization

1188
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,343
Implement functionality

1189
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,391
Out of your relationship

1190
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,671
Awesome

1191
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:21,023
It's kind of like I have to share GPS information to get all these cool

1192
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,839
You know mapping data understanding

1193
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
Like automatic

1194
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,399
Turning onto things in my house

1195
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,679
So here

1196
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
If I'm

1197
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,263
Willing to authenticate as often as needed

1198
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,079
I can do cool things like pay with my ring

1199
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:34,847
Actually

1200
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,919
Up to you to determine

1201
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:42,015
How you have a relationship with each other and

1202
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,295
How much it cost

1203
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:47,391
Actually starting to dictate more of a relationship

1204
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,231
It's possible for consumers to

1205
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,767
Put in a little bit more

1206
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,791
Instagram

1207
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,583
Okay we'll leave

1208
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,607
I feel

1209
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,911
A little better

1210
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,191
And a little bit

1211
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:06,591
Powerless to start calling on some connected device companies to start implementing some

1212
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,359
Amethyst

1213
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,895
Technology so I can

1214
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,991
I can ease my sign-in burden thank you so much for coming on the show

1215
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:22,463
