00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,608
I don't know user experience

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
Challenges we faced in the last

15
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,472
That you'll probably want to stick around for

16
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,496
After that

17
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,776

Go to load or license

26
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,136
With someone else

27
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
All of this

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
What's a good recipe

29
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,976
Now let's hear from

30
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,512
This week's weather

31
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,304
Looking for an iot platform

Find out my Kenmore and D-Link

33
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,120
Picked a pharaoh

34
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:14,240
A pharaoh customers have experienced as much as an 80% reduction in time to Market

35
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,032
99% pure

36
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
Support calls

37
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,080
In a 10x

38
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,104
Higher activation

39
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,128
Plus

40
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,712
They can never use 90% of their work from one project to the neck

41
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
To learn more visit a pharaoh

42
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,040
Dot IO

43
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,600
That's a fair o a f e r o

44
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,880
Dot IO

45
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,184
Okay

46
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
Heaven

47
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
I know it's Eva

48
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
But first

49
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,048
Actually let's just talk about Eva

50
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,352
Let's just get started this is a giant

51
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
Home Appliance

52
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,168
And houseware show in

53
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
In Germany

54
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,240
And up until a few years ago

55
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,288
It was not even on my radar

56
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
But

57
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
With the era of

58
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,920
The connected Home Smart appliances and even things like

59
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
The Amazon Echo

60
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
If I had become a

61
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
Huge trade show for us

62
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
I would have gone but

63
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
I'm actually going on vacation

64
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
Tomorrow so I'd

65
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
Yeah it's

66
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,744
I've actually follow it for a long time because it reminds me of like the

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
International version of

68
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
CSN degrees held in Berlin every year and aside from the stuff we talked about on this show there are laptops in

69
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Mobile devices

70
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,216
And so on so forth

71
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,568
Things that I cover elsewhere so there's a ton of stuff I made when I get out there

72
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
But no

73
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:28,736
I know now we're still going to hear if I just started so we're still going to be hearing news

74
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
Will cover probably neck

75
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
Score in the newsletter

76
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
But for now

77
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
With some smart speaker news

78
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
Harman Kardon

79
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:39,232
Which is now owned by Samsung actually announced a $600 Google Assistant

80
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,536
Speaker at feels like a lot of money

81
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Yeah but

82
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
I mean it

83
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,192
You're buying is for sound quality the Google assistant is kind of like

84
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,520
Well I guess it's becoming table States these days for speaker in a sentence

85
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,360
You know when you can get a Google home Max for $200 less this has

86
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,408
200 watt stereo speakers

87
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,992
Support high definition audio streaming has an LCD

88
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,808
Touch panel at the top so this is definitely a high end

89
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:08,160
Device I assume it sounds good haven't heard it obviously but it is strange to me that

90
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:13,536
Harman Kardon is making a Google Assistant speaker when they are owned by Samsung

91
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,864
I guess they in a good way they're keeping that line still

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
Semi agnostic

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,192
Yes although I would say this is

94
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,520
I'm a little concerned because remember when Sonos was talkin

95
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,592
The information actually did a story several months back about

96
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:31,712
Sonos being able to do both madhumeh which is what we call the Amazon Echo as a

97
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
Assistant to avoid setting off

98
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,344
Assistant everywhere so they wanted to add madhumeh and the Google

99
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,672
And to do that they shared a bludgeon Google with

100
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
Patents

101
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
And

102
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
What I'm

103
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,816
Certain about is you might have several speakers but you're not going to have

104
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,840
Voice assistant

105
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
On that one

106
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
Speaker even though technically it is very doable

107
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:58,080
What it is very doable and it becomes I think a political battle between the companies that provide the voice services and

108
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,736
Have they said his son has said that they're not doing the Google Assistant know cuz they did say by the end of the year so I'm kind of holding out

109
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
You know they are

110
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,784
They are still doing it but

111
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,184
To get get the ability to make a madame a speaker and a Google Assistant speaker they actually asserted their patent

112
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
Smart speaker technology

113
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,791
The series The kooples using it in the Google Max

114
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
I don't

115
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,863
Those are deep inside or negotiations

116
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
So I don't know how that exactly

117
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
It does make em like

118
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
You know I don't want to have to

119
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
To pick and choose

120
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,031
If I really want awesome sound

121
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
You know that's expensive

122
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,383
To have a matinee version and a

123
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
Google Assistant version

124
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
Absolutely

125
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
No I don't either but

126
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:41,087
Hey if you want to spend even more money you can because did you see the Bang & Olufsen

127
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,391
Speakers with the Google Assistant built in

128
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Yes

129
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
That was

130
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Neat looking

131
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,487
Like all of bang it all

132
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:52,607
Did it look like it was worth $1,750

133
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,983
No no didn't know this only get you

134
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
Google right

135
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
That is correct

136
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
Yeah

137
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
That is correct

138
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Sono

139
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
I'm going with them knowing

140
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
We say no

141
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
All right but

142
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,295
There is another option

143
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
There's booze

144
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,647
Which also introduced a new smart speaker and Sound Bars

145
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,951
And I really don't know

146
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
Like

147
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,815
This what does Amazon

148
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
Matinee

149
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
And

150
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
Leader voice assist

151
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
Since we'll follow

152
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
And

153
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,239
Also AirPlay 2 for simple streaming from

154
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
Apple devices

155
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
That's going to happen next

156
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,383
As well write the interesting thing are there voice assistants to follow

157
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
Now the question is

158
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,247
Will it be Google would it be Bixby would it be Cortana

159
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,599
Yeah I don't know

160
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,623
And I look

161
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
Looking for prices on these

162
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
And I don't

163
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
$100

164
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
400

165
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Dollars okay

166
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
So this is our mid-range

167
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,327
No that's her low-end actually right now

168
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
Speaker for a large speaker area

169
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,191
So large speaker in The Sound Bars there's a

170
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
The small one and big one

171
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,031
Retailing for roughly 550 + 8

172
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
Yay

173
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
All right we're not a speaker show

174
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
Train to Busan 2

175
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,503
Crazy stuff you could do in the home front

176
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
So

177
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Eve

178
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Barry

179
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
Sensor maker for homekit

180
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Devices

181
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,695
They actually launched a homekit air quality Mount

182
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
A t v that

183
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
Measures temperature humidity

184
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,863
Air quality it's actually really tiny like

185
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
Lot of their Eve sensors it's about

186
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,703
I don't know half the size of a cell phone

187
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,751
And this is their room to

188
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
And it's going to cost

189
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
$100

190
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
So

191
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Kind of

192
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,663
Actually that's exactly how much I paid for my oh where

193
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
Glow that measures all of these

194
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,271
What I like about this is that it's a small

195
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
Units and

196
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
Doesn't run on

197
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
Power cord

198
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,903
And some people might say well that kind of sucks

199
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
Because

200
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,743
Charge it or change batteries yes you do that's correct but

201
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,815
You can move it from room to room much easier I think that anywhere

202
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
And

203
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
That makes it very handy

204
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
Yes and worth noting

205
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
That this is the

206
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,263
First thing launched since Eve actually

207
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Split

208
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,359
Gaming Division and ditched it Salgado

209
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
Saudis used to be Elgato Eve

210
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,943
Interstate in June

211
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
Banda June

212
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,783
They actually created Eve systems

213
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
Only focus on the

214
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,903
Worth noting so this is the first one everything else is old

215
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,975
And moving right along to

216
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
You crazy

217
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
Stuff from

218
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Bosch

219
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,095
Holy moly

220
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
Okay

221
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
I got so excited by

222
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,239
Weird Ibiza so we turned into Rai

223
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Oh I never know

224
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,591
It's Chris Christ he is a scene at home reporter he's a lovely fellow

225
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
We read about the time he's been on the show

226
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
So he actually

227
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Tweeted

228
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
Cannabis presser

229
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
A bunch of stuff

230
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Including

231
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
Induction cooktops with intelligence

232
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,135
So you could understand if you're

233
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
Burning stuff

234
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
For cooking stuffed

235
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Too hot which

236
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
I thought was really

237
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
And he also showed off

238
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Schecter

239
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,631
And it's basically a projector that projects

240
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,447
An image that you can interact with on your countertop

241
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
Okay

242
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
I thought I sent

243
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
So excited

244
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
Because I actually saw the

245
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,847
The semiconductor that made this possible in the Bosch booth

246
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Yes

247
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,919
I did a whole story on it

248
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Super stoked because

249
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,247
This thing was amazing UK

250
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
You

251
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
If you put this

252
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:29,695
Since they're showing is a standalone unit but if you put this you've put this on like an Amazon Echo or something like that it actually could show you

253
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
You video

254
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
You can show you video on any surface

255
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,839
You could move your hand up and down and the resolution changed

256
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,143
Seamlessly and then you could interact with

257
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,727
So imagine if you could say if your doorbell rang in

258
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
You could turn and put your nest

259
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,055
Doorbell camera

260
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Image into this

261
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
It could just show it to you on your counter

262
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
So that's cool

263
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
Write absolute

264
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:54,783
What school is you could actually all the controls right now like we're very excited about the

265
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
Controls on the Lenovo

266
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
Smart display for things like lights

267
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Because you can take

268
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
Haji

269
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
Turn on the lights

270
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
And then it'll show you

271
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
A control

272
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
4like color tuning or thinks

273
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:10,143
Like that to me if you imagine that popping up on your counter via this type of

274
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Splayed then you just

275
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,959
Like to it right there on the counter

276
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,263
Yeah this is it's interesting

277
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,663
Because there's a whole Suite of apps that you can have it it really looks to me like they've taken the open-source version of Android and crew

278
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,735
Created their own little interface with it but I mean you could even use

279
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,039
I mean they're showing a video not a video picture of

280
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,343
Yeah the Chrome browser in Pinterest and all that

281
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,719
Do all that without a display because the Earth countertop is the display and I presume there's some kind of

282
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:40,351
And what kind of sensors they would have in the projection part itself but to allow you the interaction refit interact

283
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,679
With these apps and so on for recipes or

284
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,007
Who knows what I meant I like the idea of it I don't know that I would just

285
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,359
Put this on my countertop but I could see it as a future thing especially as they

286
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
Tweet this idea and implementation

287
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:58,783
If I get reminds me of the very last CS that Bill Gates was that he showed the quote-unquote home of the future

288
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,855
And they had projection balls so you can

289
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,183
Change the look and feel of you know what your view is like

290
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
Pretend you're in the middle of the ocean

291
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:12,607
What is all interactive and they had a projection on the countertop that you could you know through recipes and so on

292
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,423
Okay so don't just think about recipe

293
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,007
Is think about something like an interactive cooking demonstration

294
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
That if you

295
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
Put something underneath it

296
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
It could tell you like

297
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Hey

298
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
Here's how to cut the chicken and it

299
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,943
Show like lions where you

300
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Chop your chick

301
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247
So imagine kind of like an

302
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
AR on

303
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
On top of

304
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Your actual

305
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:37,951
And that's along the lines of what he showed it was kind of like you put a certain amount of food in a spot and a projector wood

306
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:43,327
Visualize it the density and someone say you need a little bit more that's too much of this recipe

307
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
You're right when you start melding

308
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
AI

309
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
And sensors and

310
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,495
Get rid of the screens have projection there something you can do

311
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
Yeah I'm super high on projector

312
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
I have been

313
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
So I love this guy

314
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
If it's like a r without the glasses

315
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,687
Yeah basically

316
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
Although in a limit

317
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Like this

318
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,903
You'll have your induction charging spot and then you'll have your projection spot and then you'll have your I don't know what's

319
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,743
Bosch also shut off a washer and dryer that basically you just

320
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,351
Throw stuff in it it senses what it is and it says this is the type of wash you should do this

321
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
This is how much soap I need

322
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167
Dispense this feels like something I have to

323
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
Maybe tahini laundry is not

324
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
This could be like a revelation

325
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,615
Remember the June and when I got this I was like even might toast taste better you guys

326
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,919
And that was a function of like really opt

327
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Optimizing for that part

328
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
Everything with

329
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Washing

330
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:38,623
Baby there is better washing and I just don't do it no notice it overtime that my clothes are cleaner and maybe they're less

331
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
What's the word I'm looking for

332
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
Born by washing

333
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
But it feels like

334
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
I don't know that I know

335
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
What I need

336
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Jhene Aiko

337
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
Right and this is a big part of

338
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,447
The IRT conundrum we don't know what we don't know yet it's almost like

339
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,983
Until you implement something

340
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,591
You want don't know that it's better or maybe it's not it will save it that's a big Challenger

341
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
Self-hating wouldn't Bosch

342
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
I want to test this out

343
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
See if it acts

344
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
What color

345
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:09,855
That was the fridge any of the fridges come in different colors that are replaceable doors as well

346
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,183
Cuz it's not really technically iot but Bosch also did show off these

347
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,255
Refrigerator doors that you can swap out in their different colors

348
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
I love color so I was really a

349
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Excited by this

350
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
But again there's no spark

351
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Associated with this

352
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,447
I know I brought it up just cuz you were so excited about

353
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
Not as excited

354
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
But that's okay

355
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
All right

356
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,871
So let's move from FIFA those are the big things we've seen so far that

357
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:36,479
Exciting let's talk about a 50 billion dollar funding for a company called pulse

358
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
Technologies

359
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
Pulse

360
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,855
These guys basically come in and

361
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
Hang your television

362
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,183
They even program your smart lights

363
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,743
Send apparently this is a bang-up business first

364
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,583
Yeah they got about 2500 vetted professionals

365
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,423
In 50 Metro areas to get them kind of like the Best Buy Geek Squad what they are

366
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,727
Train to do pretty much anything here

367
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
A smart home

368
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
Service is

369
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:05,407
Part of the deal so they can set things up for you probably help you with routines assistance Etc

370
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
Send some people leave that enough

371
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
You don't even know where

372
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:12,063
Still more oven DIY kind of thing with these devices available you know if

373
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
She's at Walmart Target and everywhere else

374
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
Some people still look like

375
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
I don't even know how to set it up

376
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,231
So you got to think about like

377
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,351
What was it we had Charlie Kendall who was the head of the Amazon Echo smart home platform

378
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,191
For a long time go over to control for which is very much a professional answer

379
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
So you know I can see how

380
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
There's a limited layer of us

381
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
That are willing to go to

382
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,223
Later and there's probably a lot of us who if you can make it affordable would totally be like you

383
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Please come in

384
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:46,623
I'll give you you know maybe I don't know if the prices like closer to like $2,000 to outfit my home and make it

385
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
Get smart you think that's a reasonable price

386
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:53,023
Maybe it depends on the home how many devices what you want the waypost as it is that this is

387
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,583
Flat fee for the service depending on the type of job

388
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
They must be doing okay though because apparently their text

389
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
Between 70 and 80000 a year

390
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
That's Not Unusual I mean

391
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,775
You're messing around with lots of stuff

392
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,359
So I'm on their website and it looks like

393
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
The way they do it is

394
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,479
If I want to do a smart home thing I basically pick a zip code so we can get the

395
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,295
Pricing I'm assuming that New York cost more than Austin

396
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
And it's like hey

397
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
Do you have a thermostat

398
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
And I'm like

399
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
Yes I want install that

400
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
Do you have Smart Home devices

401
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
What kind

402
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
It looks like they don't have

403
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
Electricians

404
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,351
Because they don't do any

405
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Lighting

406
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
Aunt that is like a light switches

407
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,959
Which is kind of a pain cuz that's a lot of the problems

408
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,031
People have but they do support like SimpliSafe

409
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,847
Security they have a bunch of baby monitors

410
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
Cameras

411
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
August door locks ring doorbell

412
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
Detarius hubs

413
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
So that's kind of a bummer

414
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
Yeah maybe.

415
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,135
Expand that cuz if I recall these guys are actually like

416
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
Smartphone repair

417
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,719
Best internet expanded into this

418
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Sector

419
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,119
So maybe this is a future Edition for them is to add Electrical Services

420
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Because that is actually a

421
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
Competitive advantage

422
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
Or like

423
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,007
Comcast when I talk to them about their installernet

424
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
Working like that's awesome you have this

425
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,591
It's a very big deal but they don't have a

426
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Electricians and

427
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
That

428
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,991
How is a really convenient thing to have someone who can install light switches

429
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
Just for you order Outlets

430
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:24,415
That's just my take one of the more painful things I have to do is install Outlets

431
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
So maybe that's just me

432
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
Maybe that's just me

433
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
Okay

434
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
So

435
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
These guys got a lot of money

436
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
What else is

437
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,399
Oster some changes coming to the Google app

438
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,239
Assistant 95 Google took a look at the latest

439
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,799
File installation for Google Assistant

440
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,847
I don't know if it's nothing released yet

441
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,455
They're seeing bits of code revealing household family mode and downtime

442
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,039
So it looks like we got some adjustments coming there or some improvement

443
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
Since they're so that's good

444
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,623
I'm chasing household will let you kind of

445
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,743
Put different people's personal information together in the home you know

446
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
I appreciate that

447
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
You know they got it right and do this

448
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,631
But I will say every time they update something

449
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
I have to

450
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,215
Like they're adding basically a new user interface

451
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,311
Austin away and then suddenly like half the time I find it I have now

452
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,895
If I want to use this new functionality I have named my devices

453
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
Does poorly or maybe

454
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
Put them in the wrong

455
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
Rooms

456
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
Or I need to put them in rooms

457
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,623
So the sounds terrible this iterative process I'm not sure it's working really well for

458
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,927
Are people and I think they probably just give up

459
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,999
Cuz I know that sometimes I just look at this and I'm like oh

460
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
I'm not going to connect this

461
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,911
Google home because I already have something called the front door and that's the lock and now I've got to have a doorbell called

462
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
Light called this

463
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
Synonym like

464
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:47,871
Yeah we're going to talk about this little more later but I'm right there with you with some recent challenges on these

465
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919
Updates and changes in the First Reactions

466
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,223
So yeah I don't know the answer because it's like

467
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
Don't do it

468
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:58,879
Wait install it professionally I mean I do want them to iterate on things right that's a

469
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
Jumping ahead

470
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:06,815
Last little bit of news for us is Google Assistant now can control your nest by Yale lock

471
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
Organys

472
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Because

473
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,703
I tried this and perhaps it's just not

474
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,727
Rolled out yet

475
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
Maybe it's a rolling release

476
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
But

477
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
My home app is not even

478
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
Show the

479
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Nest

480
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
Buy a lock

481
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
It does show my Nest hello doorbell

482
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,223
And it shows my nest

483
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Camera

484
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,063
So Stacy suggested wisely you know what

485
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,855
I think you've got to unlink

486
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Your nest

487
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,207
Products from Google home a demand account back and then it should appear

488
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
So I did that

489
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
But in doing so

490
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,399
I need to get the verification code Nest will send you free SMS when you add an account to Google home

491
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
And it never came

492
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:48,799
Okay well I should say never about 30 minutes later we'd already given up it came so I finally re-added

493
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
The Nest back to Google home

494
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
And guess what happened

495
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
It's not there

496
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
It's still not there so

497
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,063
Maybe just rolling out with the whole fact that you have to unlink accounts just to add new devices

498
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
Is Eminem

499
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
Maybe will magically disappear

500
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,903
Google home for me

501
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,207
Mine has not met so I have one

502
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,511
And I have linked to my Google home account

503
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
To my nest

504
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
Account it is not magically appear

505
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
Okay what when it does

506
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,215
If and when it does you should be able to

507
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
Query your Google home

508
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,615
To see if the front door or the front door any door the lock is locked or not

509
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
And you can lock it by voice

510
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
For security reasons

511
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,271
They have decided to not allow voice unlocking at this

512
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,343
Before start complaining

513
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
Kevin would you like

514
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,927
To talk about the new device that you tried

515
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
I would love to talk about

516
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,303
I tested out and still testing out the Phillips

517
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
Hue Lily spotlight

518
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,911
I'll tell you right up front what you get they are

519
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
3

520
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
LED outdoor spots

521
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
And a low voltage

522
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,151
Plug-in Transformer so you literally just plugged into an outlet they are weather resistant so they obviously they could be outside

523
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
It's $280

524
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
For these

525
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
If you would like to add additional

526
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Spots

527
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,879
They are $80 each and I know that sounds odd because you're like what wattage is by

528
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Free

529
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
Regular spots because you don't get the

530
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,975
A Transformer with a single

531
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
LED

532
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
Spot

533
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,327
Transformer can handle up a 5 spotlights

534
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
Being from Philips Hue

535
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
You got your choice

536
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
16 million colors

537
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,239
The nice thing about these you can control each

538
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Color

539
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,055
Honeyspot individually

540
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:29,151
So I kind of celebrating Christmas for example with one red and one green eye

541
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,015
Last night which everybody was walking by going what are you doing and I said okay I'll put it back to White

542
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,831
So you got all your choice of the colors and regular white

543
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:43,487
Set up pretty easy I like how they've done that they've made a wiring heavy duty and these connectors will you

544
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
Connect and

545
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
Screw in the

546
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
1

547
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,679
Wire to the next wire it's very simple you cannot not do it correctly it's impossible to do wrong

548
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
So that part is easy

549
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
Is about 15 ft in between each

550
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
Anywhere

551
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Scrapy

552
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,359
However I don't know maybe it's my home

553
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,639
I could not

554
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
Connect this

555
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,223
2eather matinee

556
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Google assist

557
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,295
I was successful with

558
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,319
Siri and

559
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Home Care

560
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,927
So that worked out fine but I don't know why I could not connect this

561
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,487
True either my other assistants for my wake up

562
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
So

563
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:21,119
Not sure this requires the Philips Hue Bridge which is not included so hopefully you already have one

564
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,911
If not I can take over about 60 bucks

565
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,983
And pre-teen just like any other

566
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,543
Set of bulbs you know it's very similar just meant for outdoors

567
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,359
And you had a hue Bridge

568
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,967
I do have a Hubert sent to me all these are loaner units yes

569
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
One Challenge

570
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:43,903
That I had during setup I said it was easy and it was but for some reason not the bridge but the bulbs themselves

571
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
Needed a firmware up

572
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,999
Update and it said right in the app this could take up to an hour

573
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,327
And I told you say so you're like I haven't felt I'm sorry quick

574
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
It wasn't quick it was like 30 minutes

575
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:59,519
30 minutes to get that firmware update pushed over I guess because of the zigbee connection

576
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
Yes signius

577
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,711
Is that happened but that is a constant Source actually for me

578
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
With my shoes

579
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,503
I very rarely going

580
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
NBA app

581
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
Cuz I have home

582
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
Factory automated

583
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,879
So it is inevitable that when I want to do something

584
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Like a little

585
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
Fancy

586
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
I turned it the app

587
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
Inevitably there is an update

588
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
Waiting for me

589
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
And that I can't do what I want to do

590
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
Until I

591
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
Download

592
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
The update

593
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,448
I kind of wish those were automatic I understand why they might not be

594
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,752
Because sometimes when they do an update the lights to flash

595
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:36,128
For example dated at 2 a.m. and I was sleeping in my lights only flash tan I would be

596
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,432
Upset so I can get where like

597
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,992
As a manufacturer there when do we let the

598
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,320
Control passed to the user versus us doing it

599
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
But it is

600
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,392
And that is a long time

601
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
And speaking of frustrating

602
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
Let's talk about some frustration

603
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,536
So this week I have had

604
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,096
Two devices do software update

605
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,888
Broken functionality

606
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
It makes me sad

607
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
The first is my Tesla

608
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
I don't know what

609
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
There is some update and now

610
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
My garage door won't

611
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Open the Homelink

612
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
Functionality does not work on

613
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,664
And I can't reprogram it

614
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
I can't do anything

615
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
And so basically

616
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,808
This is very much a first world problem probably a one percenter problem

617
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,600
Not actually 1-percenter but

618
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
I get this is not something

619
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,904
Is attic about

620
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,696
I don't have to use my garage door opener

621
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,512
My car does not automatically open the garage door anymore

622
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
Because

623
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
Can a lot of money for this car

624
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
I don't really have a lot of recoil

625
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,448
Of course I called the Tesla people in there going to

626
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
I'll look into it but

627
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,056
It's a little frustrating to have something work one day and then the next.

628
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,640
Yeah software updates in general it's

629
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:47,040
Hit or miss you know you'd hope things are tested but is every single function tested somebody test the Homelink feature

630
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,112
Probably not because it changes are likely not related

631
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,672
To it but something broke something is what it sounds like

632
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,208
So the other asp

633
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
Is

634
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,048
Frustrating is my June oven

635
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,840
Y'all my June oven

636
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
The device I thought could do no wrong

637
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
And I still love it but

638
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
It didn't update to add some

639
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,568
Actually really good functionality that's more instructions for people like where to put the

640
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,360
The temperature probe when you're trying to cook

641
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
It shows you a picture

642
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Nice

643
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,944
Because some people that were like

644
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
My food isn't done and I'm like

645
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,576
Kitchen start at deeply enough in the right spot and they're like no insert the probe

646
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
So that was good but somehow

647
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
I don't know how

648
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
It no longer recognizes

649
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Does my toast

650
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
My brand of bread

651
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,792
So it keeps telling me I put my bread in the oven

652
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
To toast it

653
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
And it's like

654
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,376
Is a strudel or a poptart

655
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:40,544
Is Pop-Tarts and salmon one of the other cuz they're both kind of square

656
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
Oh yeah yeah

657
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,872
So it's not strudel it's not Pop-Tarts

658
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,664
It's toast and it used to recognize it

659
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,712
It needs to be all cool if you like oh

660
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
The bread and

661
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
Four pieces of it do you want me to toast

662
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
Lately or

663
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
Medium or whatever

664
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
But now I have to press

665
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
Again

666
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,440
Not the end of the world

667
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Nobody

668
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,792
But it's not functioning the way you expect as you are was functioning

669
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,816
Totally agree

670
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:07,424
I'm going to take a wild guess here though because I actually had a problem with my June oven as well Reese

671
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,288
Mine was not preheating anything you would literally

672
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,336
Set a temperature in normally would say

673
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
Pre-heating

674
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
But it just wasn't preheating

675
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,920
They would just start cooking

676
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:21,248
And that's not good because that's not the right temperature yet

677
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,576
The good thing about the June there support people are fantastic

678
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,368
Tandoori over there help me out

679
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:34,048
They're all good they're all good but somehow I always get to where the thing is they can actually

680
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
Delete with your permission

681
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
Go and look at the logs

682
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
Of

683
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,424
The oven see everything that happened

684
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,288
Which is awesome for finding problems and they found a problem with one of my heating elements one time before and

685
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
Literally just sent me a brand new oven

686
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,640
You know they paid to send that and send back the other one

687
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,200
So they found that out from the logs in this case

688
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,528
The problem that I had anymore wondering if it's related

689
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
Christine

690
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,112
Camera up top of the oven

691
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,160
Gets eventually covered with

692
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Stuff

693
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:09,376
You have to at least clean the camera off and I'll tell you why because the June my June was functioning as

694
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,680
Design it doesn't see any food

695
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,984
In there that's how it goes to preheat

696
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:19,104
Because they were struts on the camera said we must be something here I don't know what it is but

697
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
Let's start cooking

698
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
So

699
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,200
That's what happened to me and sure enough

700
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
After checking the log

701
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,808
We determined that was my issue I clean off the camera

702
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
And I got my preheat function back

703
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,720
100% of the time so it could be the food ID is not quite right because you're not giving it

704
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Best data

705
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,072
OKC and that's a very analog problem

706
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,352
I love it okay

707
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,912
D'usse try that and then go down the South

708
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
And I was thinking

709
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,240
Another aspect of

710
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
Especially with

711
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,848
And you'll see because I have the CEO of chefsteps

712
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Which makes the

713
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
Joule sous vide

714
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,456
I was thinking about some of their recipes so

715
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
June

716
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,272
Creates these pre-selected

717
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,296
Recipes for you so you just

718
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,832
Pop salmon in and say

719
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,880
Hadist I want it done and it just does it

720
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,184
But those things get tweaked over time

721
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,744
I was thinking band what if I really liked

722
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,072
One way they cooked it and they change that recipe over time and then

723
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,888
Suddenly It's just slightly different and maybe not as good

724
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,424
And you may not there's not a lot of

725
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
Transparency

726
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
So

727
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
You may just be like huh

728
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
What's happened here

729
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
I was thinking about that

730
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,336
Because I was thinking about changing

731
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:27,200
The sous-vide and suddenly I was like I kind of have lost all control over how things

732
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
Thanks might taste

733
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,784
But most of it is better so that's an okay tradeoff

734
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
I don't know these are things

735
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,416
Yeah I know you're right it's not transparent because the algorithms get tweet

736
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,464
Is all the information from device owners

737
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
It's crowdsource on the cooking results and such

738
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
So

739
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,864
I guess when we took a stake it tastes the same for everybody as a June oven

740
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,888
Cooking a steak

741
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,216
And I would love I'm pretty sure I suggested it on the

742
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
User forum

743
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
He let me save

744
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,312
The cooking method

745
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,848
Because that's how I like it

746
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:59,968
Right you did it right but all the sudden it changed and all I wanted the way that used to be so let me save that

747
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
Yes

748
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,528
Basically your own personal rollbacks on

749
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,064
I like it

750
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,624
Okay which is only useful for

751
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,672
Things that are not security-related that's

752
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
Probably have

753
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
You got a patch

754
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
But other than that

755
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,560
Okay

756
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096
Well this was our

757
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Yes weekly complain session

758
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
We don't usually complain very much but

759
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,216
Monthly

760
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,264
So let's go to Riot

761
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,848

762
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,384
The iot podcast

763
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,688
Listener hotline is brought to you by Schlage

7424 and ask us a question

768
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
And we will

769
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,352
Are you into the drawing

770
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:53,728
This month's drawing actually ends Friday at midnight eastern time so Friday August 31st

771
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
Pikachu

772
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,032
Basically a day-and-a-half

773
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,312
Tacoma's and remember

774
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
Smarter homes

775
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
Starfish leg

776
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:04,480
As of last week we answered a question from the a listener about tracking his

777
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:09,088
And we gave many options but we kind of forgot a really obvious one in

778
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
A bunch of guys called us on it

779
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,392
So thank you

780
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,928
We forgot about life

781
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:20,096
Which is a really good app that it is an app that you can put on your phone it also integrates with lots of services like if this

782
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:23,168
Send that it has a deal with BMW has a deal with some

783
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,776
Security companies in basically this app lets you see where your kids are

784
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
Where any of your family

785
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,640
And it can be really useful and if you use it with f

786
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,992
When your kids get within your house range they can actually give you an alert

787
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,320
So David include some nice pictures like a group chat

788
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,112
Fear family and such within the app

789
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
So

790
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,928
Guys we didn't talk about that

791
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,000
Because it's not a thing but we should have because it does talk to things

792
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
What is a thing

793
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
Is the thing on your phone

794
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Okay

795
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,656
So this week's question comes to us from

796
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Donna

797
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
Hey guys

798
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:57,984
Doncic

799
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
My question for you is

800
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,592
Is it against

801
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,616
I'm wondering

802
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,664
Is there something you can think of

803
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
I could either make

804
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
Or by

805
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
The budget of

806
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,528
Lesson about fish

807
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
Dollars

808
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,576
Love you good gifts

809
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,160
For someone who is moving into a college dorm

810
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
So the money is leaving home

811
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
Moving into a dorm

812
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,656
I'd love to hear your ideas

813
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
Project

814
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
Show

815
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,664
Oh. Free question and Kevin actually just wrote a story last week about how to out

816
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,760
Take your kids to worm with some smart stuff so you should definitely check that out

817
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,576
But it sounds like this isn't your kids are just trying to be a thot

818
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
4% witch

819
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
Amazing

820
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,440
So we try to come up with some equally thoughtful

821
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
Ideas for you that are

822
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
Beyond Justice

823
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,304
Plant sow

824
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,096
Kevin came up with

825
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
I really don't want

826
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,472
Well it's a potentially good one it depends on the person that you're buying for

827
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,776
This past weekend I move my

828
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,592
Daughter into Kutztown University for her

829
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,896
First-year College one thing I noticed

830
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,176
A lot of the kids

831
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,480
Walking around with water bottles

832
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:18,368
There was a hot day I will say that but you know they weren't carrying a Starbucks cup they were carrying their own water bottle

833
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:23,744
So I thought you know what Stacy has a bunch of water bottles I'll bet you there's an inexpensive one

834
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,376
It's kind of connected to help you track your hydration for under fifty bucks and I think you found one

835
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,912
It is called the hydrate

836
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,936
Hi

837
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
Dra.

838
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,240
Spark

839
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
To. O

840
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,800
There are two of these

841
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,592
One is $50

842
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,616
But that's right

843
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:43,456
The edge of your price range there so I say go for the $45 one

844
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
Is Bluetooth

845
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,272
It links to an app

846
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
And it

847
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
The Lowe's

848
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
When you need to drink more

849
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,184
So it starts blowing and it also integrates with Fitbit Apple watch

850
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,952
Other things

851
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,512
So basically as you drink

852
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,352
That water's going to get transferred into your Fitbit data and

853
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,656
As you need to drink it'll start

854
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:09,056
Chloe which actually might be kind of disruptive so think about it in a darkened classroom or movie theater you may want to turn that glow

855
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Low functionality off

856
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,616
Oh I wouldn't

857
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:20,320
I got a battery-powered Hue Spotlight I'm taking with me to the movies

858
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:26,208
So that was one option another I was looking for a bluetooth light bulb

859
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,744
That had a remote

860
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,816
Because I thought it'd be nice to have a

861
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
Light bulb

862
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,888
That you could put in something like a lamp

863
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
And be able to turn it off

864
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
Even if the switch is across the

865
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
The real or

866
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
At night

867
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,056
But I couldn't find a Bluetooth one that had a remote

868
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
So if anyone else

869
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
Found one

870
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,176
Let me know I did find some on Amazon but I can't say that

871
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:50,528
Use them or heard of anybody that uses them and almost all of them they did have remotes

872
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:54,368
But almost all of them also had a speaker built in which actually might be nicer

873
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,392
Tazewell for playing

874
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Some music

875
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,720
But I cannot speak to the quality of the morning like that

876
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,536
So I found

877
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
I recommend

878
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
The

879
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,352
Ikea

880
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
Tradfri

881
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
For $50 you can

882
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,936
Barely get away with it

883
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,984
So there is a dimmer and a bulb

884
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,288
And then you have to buy the hub for $30

885
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,592
If that appeals to you

886
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,896
It's going to have a Wi-Fi component I was trying to avoid

887
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,200
But I couldn't

888
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:25,600
So those are the two things that we thought might be a good gift for someone going away to college that are under $50

889
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,184
We also found one other thing that you may love or hate

890
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,208
T Phillips

891
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,512
Makes a wake up light alarm clock

892
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
With a sunrise

893
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,328
It also has a clock in there

894
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,352
So this is

895
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,424
About 50 bucks on Amazon there are more expensive models

896
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:44,800
Colors that basically you set your alarm and it can make noise but it doesn't have to

897
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,080
It can also

898
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,360
That is that it would

899
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
Light up

900
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,944
Instead so this might be good if you have a roommate

901
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
That you know

902
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,992
Doesn't like

903
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,784
To wake up as early as you do

904
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,112
And it might also be a nice way for someone who may not be used

905
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,160
Used to getting up in the morning on their own

906
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,184
Kind of

907
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,280
Set up an alarm that's loud and also a force function with the lady

908
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
I don't know

909
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
There's another ID

910
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,632
Okay Donna I hope that helps

911
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
End

912
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
Guys if you guys think of any

913
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
What is that

914
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
All right

915
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
I think it is

916
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,312
Now time for us to

917
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
Take a break for a bit

918
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:22,432
Message from our sponsor and stick around because after that we are going to be talking to

919
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,248
To Chris Young the CEO of chefsteps

920
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,088
About why he didn't put it in her face on the Joule sous vide cooker

921
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,880
We're going to tell you about what the heck sous vide

922
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
Actually is

923
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
And

924
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,464
His decision to

925
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
Go it alone as opposed to licensing

926
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
With large Appliance vendor

927
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,328
Aldis

928
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,864
And more in a moment

929
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:48,032
Hey everyone we are taking a break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week

930
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
Cancer is a

931
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
Pharaoh

932
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,848
And I have Joe Britt

933
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
CEO of a feral here

934
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,968
To get started why don't you describe a pharaoh for

935
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,040
A pharaoh is a sensor to Cloud IO

936
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
Party platform

937
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,112
We really take a lot of pride in

938
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,904
The fact that it really just

939
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:10,048
Works our customers tell us that it's the best choice for them for a fantastic end-user experience

940
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
And great developer productivity

941
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,632
I think a lot of this comes

942
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:17,984
From the fact that a bunch of acid of pharaoh came from places like apple nest

943
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,384
Google Android or Netflix and we really wanted to bring the best of engineering and design disciplines from the

944
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
Those previous

945
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,944
Experiences into iot

946
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,576
We've been talking for the last few weeks about a pharaoh and how some of its customers such as Kenmore and D-Link

947
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,136
Camping using your software to cut 80%

948
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,416
Off their time-to-market

949
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,488
And giving them the ability to reuse 90%

950
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
Of their works

951
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,024
Someone project

952
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072
This is really exceptional

953
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:46,656
So let's focus today on what you guys do with the

954
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
Back end of

955
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
Iot system

956
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,288
You can really think of Artie and three big parts

957
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,336
There's first the supply chain

958
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,872
Which is all about the sea

959
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,408
Security and efficiency

960
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,176
Actually

961
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
Building a

962
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
Then you've got the

963
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
Device in

964
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:06,368
Which has to do with the security and Wade that particular device communicates

965
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,904
But then we reach the part that you

966
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
The back

967
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
And the backend device

968
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
Is really the engine room of

969
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,816
The system and it's all about how

970
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Responsive

971
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:19,680
Scalable and how resilient the system is insecurity has to undergo

972
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
And all of that

973
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,752
Many end-user complaints that we

974
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
We heard can ultimately be traced

975
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,640
2 problems with the back end the back end is the part that guides the

976
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:35,040
Policy and business logic and is triggered by different events that translate ultimately into the vital control

977
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,832
And asset data for an application

978
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,624
So what happens to device

979
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
Stata when it arrives

980
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,184
This is critical

981
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,488
The data has to be processed instantly

982
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,816
So the end-user feels like they're just using

983
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,936
Normal or traditional remote control and he can't be something that takes seconds and seconds to respond

984
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,728
So we've got to take into account

985
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
Whole round trip

986
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
The traffic

987
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,056
Plus acting on whatever the

988
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,616
Particular command was and implementing whatever the

989
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,920
The policies are there relevant to that command

990
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,712
We have to squeeze all of this down in

991
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
2 millisecond

992
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
This demands

993
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,040
I truly elasticum

994
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,856
Implementation that is extremely optimized

995
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,136
In terms of processing

996
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
Achieve that

997
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,952
The data also has

998
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,232
Be structured properly

999
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:19,328
So that once we retrieve it we can easily feed it into different Analytics

1000
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,608
Machine learning tool

1001
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
And then we have to scale all of that

1002
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,680
Up to thousands

1003
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
Millions of devices

1004
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:29,824
Without sacrificing any of that responsiveness or security then on top of the whole thing

1005
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,920
We have to make it super reliable and that means High availability

1006
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,480
Multi-zone multi cloud implementations

1007
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:40,064
That sounds like a lot so where can people go to find out more

1008
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
In about a pharaoh

1009
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
The best place

1010
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,416
To start is a pharaoh.

1011
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
Slash go big

1012
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
That's

Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

1020
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
And today's guest

1021
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
Is

1022
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
Young who is this

1023
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,880
CEO and co-founder at

1024
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Chefsteps

1025
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,184
Hi Chris how are you doing

1026
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
I'm doing great

1027
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
You're having me on today

1028
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,768
All right

1029
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,560
I am super excited because

1030
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,328
You guys

1031
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
Not only are you a recipe site

1032
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
But you are also

1033
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,704
The maker of the Joule sous vide

1034
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,008
Booker and I've been playing with us for a while

1035
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,360
Okay let's kick it off with why you guys decided to basic

1036
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,152
Invent a

1037
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
Internet connected

1038
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,200
Cooking device

1039
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,504
Sure it's not the most obvious

1040
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,344
Project that supposedly we didn't start as a Huntington recipe

1041
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,184
Late 2011 early 2012 and we had a real Folk

1042
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,976
Modernist approaches

1043
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,024
Cooking because I had been too cooperative.

1044
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
We started this

1045
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,864
Videos up on YouTube

1046
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
Cookie recipes

1047
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
Stuff.com

1048
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
And the real point was to see if anyone

1049
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,008
Interested if anybody you know

1050
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Would follow what

1051
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,824
And that was about as far as

1052
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,176
The really good news was it turned out there was a huge Global audience

1053
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
Dewberry very quickly

1054
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
And a lot of

1055
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,296
Custom content videos

1056
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,088
The information we were providing

1057
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,368
And there was a real

1058
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,672
That we were clearly serving

1059
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,512
Okay before we go any further we should probably tell everybody what sous vide

1060
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:29,632
Chevy cooking is I think about it is just the way of adding a measured amount of

1061
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,936
A recipe for that food is never older cook

1062
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,704
Or under

1063
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,776
And it's a technique that used and many of the best restaurants

1064
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,592
Around the world and even many restaurants does it surprise you

1065
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,808
Usually in some sort of flexible food grade plastic bag of your vacuum sealed bags

1066
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,624
FoodSaver you didn't put the food into a water bath

1067
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,904
You have some device

1068
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,464
Marquesa Jewel suvee cooker

1069
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
Temperature for the doneness

1070
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,536
You want so if

1071
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,352
Do you want your steak medium rare you might put it in the water

1072
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,376
The water might heat up

1073
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:07,776
Tuesday 122 degrees 124 degrees Fahrenheit

1074
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:11,360
The water and when you're ready to eat you can take the food out and give it a quick

1075
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,968
Beer and you're going to have a steak this better than I would say probably 95% of all dressed

1076
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,992
You would go to

1077
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:21,600
Because the food is actually going to have no risk of being overcooked and it's relatively simple

1078
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,880
Okay

1079
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,416
So from the website

1080
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,488
You decided that people are interested especially in sous vide

1081
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,328
Yeah so we decided ultimately

1082
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,864
We recognize it was a real

1083
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,888
I'll need to have a better p

1084
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:37,216
Piece of sushi Hardware that we could see that no matter how much cost

1085
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,288
After we put in education

1086
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,384
Should we give people the most accurate thermostat

1087
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,176
Ever had in their kitchen before

1088
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:46,944
The problem is

1089
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
Nobody else

1090
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,016
Set it to 2 degrees difference

1091
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,064
A pretty big difference in the final outcome

1092
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
Or that chicken

1093
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,672
And you know what we saw was everything

1094
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,720
The time was a direct descendant of Laboratory

1095
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,512
Gadget

1096
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,536
Intimidating

1097
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
And we need the benefits

1098
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
Tremendous

1099
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
Professional

1100
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,192
Habits to be tremendously helpful to Homefront

1101
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
But you're going to need

1102
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,032
To have a piece of Hardware it was designs in the ground up

1103
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
Be more helpful to home

1104
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,848
Not forcing

1105
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,504
We did spend some time talking to other Hardware manufacturers about this because

1106
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,064
Our eyes were recently wide open about whatever

1107
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,112
Make a hardware device

1108
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,416
Ourselves but after spending several months

1109
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:34,304
Leading Hardware manufacturers became convinced that they didn't see the same vision that we did for what was

1110
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
Possible

1111
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,632
In terms of creating internet-connected devices

1112
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,168
It would actually be there till

1113
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
Help them get the most out of their tools

1114
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,872
We're going to make the device

1115
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:51,712
We safe to be an actual cooking tool that's really going to empower

1116
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,528
That was supposed to be goal and it was

1117
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,088
Still pretty naive about making

1118
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
You opened it right up

1119
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,696
Let's talk about

1120
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,792
One of the things that we thought was important as we didn't want it to be a gadget

1121
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,072
We wanted it to be

1122
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,864
What is a professional chef

1123
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
The knife for example

1124
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,240
Play the tool I reline a tie

1125
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,776
Use it all the time it is

1126
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,800
Central Perk

1127
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
Do my job

1128
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,104
You might look at a bread maker

1129
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,992
Who bought one maybe comes out once a year and then it goes to

1130
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,528
The back of the cupboard and never get

1131
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
It again

1132
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,576
We didn't want to be

1133
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,112
All in the back

1134
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
We knew how beautiful

1135
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,416
Holiday today

1136
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
Understand

1137
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
People's Kitchen

1138
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,000
And you know

1139
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,816
Countertop real estate or top-drawer real estate

1140
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
Really really valuable

1141
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,888
And things need to be compact

1142
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,216
CB devices wait about 9 or 10

1143
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,520
Towns they were relatively enormous

1144
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,568
Reskin Laboratory

1145
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
We set out with the

1146
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:55,199
Small enough that it could fit in that top drawer easy to grab

1147
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
Quick to use on a Wednesday night

1148
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,271
But one of the challenges

1149
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,551
Sous vide is your heating water

1150
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,623
And anybody who has a background in physics

1151
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,415
Tremendous amount of heat energy

1152
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
Teresa Teng

1153
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,767
The power of a light bulb

1154
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
We're dealing with you

1155
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,071
1100 Watts

1156
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:11,839
Power Wiki

1157
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,911
Maybe about 80% of what you can even take out of an outlet

1158
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,983
Please check the device down.

1159
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:23,615
Small enough to fit into a countertop door needs to be about an inch and 3/4 deep

1160
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
You're sinking

1161
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,407
Huge amount of power

1162
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,175
Smaller

1163
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:30,271
Smaller surface area

1164
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,087
Tiny heater core

1165
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,367
80% of the water

1166
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,159
A nuclear reactor core

1167
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,951
Actually pull that off

1168
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,975
We had to invent some

1169
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,767
Proprietary New Heating technology

1170
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:44,607
Even make that possible so these are in retrospect there was a lot of goo

1171
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,911
We thought we could do that those are just some of the engineer

1172
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,983
Let you know we wrangled with

1173
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263
Trying to figure out how do you be a hardware

1174
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,591
Actually want to tell people I'm cooking with nuclear fission

1175
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
I know

1176
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127
I'm right

1177
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,711
Let's talk about one of the controversial decision

1178
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
You guys made

1179
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:06,879
Because I'll be honest when I pulled out the jewel I was like hey there's just this one button on the top and

1180
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,719
I don't actually I'm not a huge lover of screen to my smartphone to

1181
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,023
Pest control things so I kind of looked askance

1182
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
The fact that this

1183
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,399
$180 or $200 device that had no interface without

1184
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,447
I will say that was a contra

1185
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,239
Botanica

1186
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,519
Wasn't taken light

1187
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,079
It was polarized

1188
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,639
In fact I think when we first launched I remember reading

1189
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,175
Comments on the subreddit

1190
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:30,943
Sous vide

1191
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,759
This decision should be dragging the

1192
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
Shotwell

1193
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,319
Whoever that person was

1194
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,855
And the person you want to go out

1195
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
The reason for that

1196
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
We did as good a job as we

1197
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
Lights up.

1198
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,279
Explaining your customers why we met

1199
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,583
This goes back to

1200
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,655
Werecognizeyou

1201
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
Keep things up

1202
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:56,287
Luke heat energy around the real opportunity was to

1203
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
Devices

1204
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,591
Because if you think about it

1205
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,127
Every technology we have

1206
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,663
The average home kitchen

1207
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,199
Is actually recognized

1208
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,295
It hasn't changed that much

1209
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,647
And all of them require you to translate what you want I want

1210
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,415
My check in Taiwan

1211
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,719
Christmas Canon

1212
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:18,047
I want it done at 7:30 you have to translate that into

1213
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,839
Engineer parameters like should the oven be

1214
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,167
How long will it

1215
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,215
This is where a lot of

1216
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,031
Fusion comes up

1217
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,823
Opportunity

1218
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,127
What's the actually create a way of interacting

1219
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,431
What devices does a fundamentally more human weigh

1220
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,223
You could express your crap

1221
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,039
Princes of Hell won't mistake to look like this I want to eat it

1222
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:43,903
This time and you didn't have to translate that necessarily into knowing that that means

1223
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,695
Probably want your water Bassett

1224
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,767
28 degrees Fahrenheit

1225
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:52,351
Putting a manual temperature

1226
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
Or you can just look at the image

1227
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:57,471
Which of the following human vocabulary

1228
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
The one I want

1229
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,519
The texture of that short

1230
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,799
Rib that looks right to me

1231
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,847
Here's how my food is that

1232
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,151
Geometric information

1233
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,711
It looks like the food will be done at this

1234
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,575
Pulled over

1235
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
2% right

1236
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
We also

1237
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,647
Depersonalized

1238
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:19,487
Because different people would want to post advice in different ways by moving all those

1239
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Bulldog

1240
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,119
Ability to make the device better over time

1241
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,143
It gave us the Opera

1242
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,447
To think about new ways to interact such as

1243
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
We have now

1244
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,799
Because voice when your hand

1245
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,615
Voices of phenomena way of communicating with your device

1246
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,223
Baby apple juice phone there's information

1247
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,063
Another way

1248
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,343
Preverbal

1249
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,391
Why we know some people would like to have that fish

1250
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,439
We basically felt it

1251
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,463
The trade-offs

1252
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:55,839
Worth living things

1253
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:59,167
We were really interested in finding the customers who bought into this idea

1254
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
More devices

1255
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:07,359
Create new features we can get better over time and that's really the long-term View

1256
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:11,199
Just about Joule sous-vide device there will be other Hardware there will be other services

1257
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
We wanted to demonstrate

1258
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,551
The kitchen can actually leverage software in a way

1259
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,575
It allows you to

1260
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
More

1261
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:21,439
Make it more human not less human because there are things

1262
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,999
Computers and software can do they're just really hard

1263
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,791
Skilled professional set

1264
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,351
That was kind of a decision behind it

1265
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
And I think on some level

1266
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,911
We could have put us

1267
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,751
That really would have been

1268
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,311
Thai chicken the pressure off us

1269
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,615
Really think very hard about how to make

1270
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,479
14 function that required us to be really good at

1271
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,039
I need to be really focused on reliability

1272
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,087
To really think about user experience

1273
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,623
How does needed to work

1274
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,439
We could have laid out but you know

1275
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:59,839
As far as we can tell where the best-selling connected to be device now where the number two in the market the leading devices is large

1276
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863
Actually not Reliant

1277
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,911
And that gives us

1278
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,215
Going relationship with our customers

1279
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,031
So that we keep getting better over time so it looks like that

1280
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
Asian accent

1281
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,335
Panned out pretty well for us

1282
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
Havaianas

1283
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,127
Totally honest

1284
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:18,015
Continue to demonstrate our customers that was a good decision I continually shipping updates

1285
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
Okay

1286
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,855
So what is your thought process around if

1287
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,391
The company goes out of business

1288
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,439
Do you have actual things in place

1289
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,975
Sword is everyone sous vide

1290
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
To stop work

1291
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,047
One of the nice day

1292
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,375
Think about that in there are we've actually had

1293
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,983
I'll be able to security pretty seriously so there are aspects of

1294
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,519
The device where we would have to

1295
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:43,871
To make it possible for other developers to support it but there are plans

1296
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,991
Do that the infrastructure is in place simply we're using our own internal apis to do

1297
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:55,391
Do these kind of things that would be relatively trivial press to open that up this is kind of the end of life for Oscar

1298
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,951
That would be something we could do and we have seen enough

1299
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,511
People attempt to reverse-engineer some

1300
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,535
I'm going to basic

1301
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,167
Acordeon Sol

1302
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,239
That's a tricky question

1303
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,055
Still an internal discussion of where those boundaries are how do we

1304
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,895
Spectre customers data privacy so we're not quite ready to do

1305
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,711
But that is something we're actively thinking about how do we

1306
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,039
Encourage more people to keep innovating with soccer in the kitchen

1307
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,319
And connecting your device

1308
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,855
Put that software

1309
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,903
Apache Corp

1310
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,463
Along this line

1311
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,023
Let's talk about business models for the smart

1312
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,071
Because a lot of Kinect

1313
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
Set device maker

1314
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,631
There's a lot of innovation have

1315
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:46,591
But there's also a really big establish number of vendors out there who make

1316
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,127
The traditional home appliances

1317
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,199
When I look at what they're trying to do it feels like

1318
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,527
You're a pure software the intelligence you guys are built

1319
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,319
The years might be

1320
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:00,159
Well suited for GE or Whirlpool to come in and buy in

1321
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,183
Maybe make part of

1322
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:04,767
I know they don't have a sous-vide option yet but make part of their own

1323
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,791
Kitchen ecosys

1324
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,327
What are your thoughts around

1325
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,095
How that's going

1326
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
These companies

1327
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,239
But we haven't yet results

1328
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,775
Questions we have

1329
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
Allow us to go forward

1330
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,823
One of the first

1331
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,591
Issues X

1332
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,359
Pragmatic

1333
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,895
A lot of the things we really want

1334
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,687
We will have more announced

1335
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:29,599
Control over the hardware the sensors

1336
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
Calibration

1337
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,903
Be able to

1338
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,439
Provide clean data

1339
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,231
To our various cloud services

1340
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,255
To do things like

1341
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,279
Cooking times

1342
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,095
Significantly or make predictions about how the

1343
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,655
Do you think you certainly see how they would be a

1344
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,703
But those device manufacturers

1345
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:47,519
We have to get on board

1346
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,847
Much much better sensors in the device make the best of it

1347
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
The market

1348
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,895
$10,000 rack

1349
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,943
If you actually test

1350
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,967
And we did for love

1351
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,015
You'd be surprised to find that the app

1352
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
About plus or minus

1353
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
Dad

1354
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,111
It's terrible

1355
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,135
Right

1356
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:09,279
Humidity control is well so these oem's of

1357
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,047
Kitchen Hardware

1358
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,655
We have to get really serious about

1359
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,679
Pretty much better

1360
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,751
The hard work of calibrating to get

1361
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,287
Usually reserved for

1362
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:23,615
Precision lab equipment

1363
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,711
You could imagine we could work with him on that but

1364
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,015
Distortion everything for us

1365
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,807
All the sudden we're really having

1366
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:35,903
And most of our time working with these licensees to bring them up to where we're already

1367
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,207
How much is

1368
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,279
What is teams

1369
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,559
Other issue is

1370
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,351
We're building our own Hardware

1371
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,655
Software

1372
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,447
When were citic vertically integrated that way

1373
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,983
We have real Clarity over

1374
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:50,751
Lacoste

1375
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:56,383
There's no ambiguity of how we make money there's no ambiguity about like whose needs are you serving

1376
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
Change it

1377
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,455
Licensing organization well

1378
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,735
Is Electrolux a customer

1379
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,759
Is there any

1380
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,087
When you start to get ambiguity

1381
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,391
In particular we want a very low structure and Bayern

1382
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,695
Anderson in a company

1383
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,231
Customer is always LED

1384
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,047
Problem bad decision-making about

1385
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,351
What's a prioritize what's a really work on

1386
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,375
So does that

1387
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:22,495
You guys kind of has a niche product or a luxury product for a while to come then

1388
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,823
I don't think $100 a day

1389
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,895
Without disclosing numbers and we have customers

1390
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:32,735
In the six-figure range and growing rapidly

1391
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,087
Free to continue to grow out from this week

1392
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,879
Can't wait to grow our Revenue fast

1393
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,927
Goodbye license yet but that's never been out

1394
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:44,511
Yeah we are really focused on making sure that we are

1395
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,071
Retaining our customers engaging them and serving them

1396
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:50,143
Well over time so that they continue to be customer for years

1397
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,471
And let's talk about additional Hardware I'm sure you're not going to

1398
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,751
Disclosure product ramp

1399
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,799
But let's talk about where you might

1400
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,335
Go pure products

1401
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,383
Lot of companies who build Hardware looking

1402
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,663
Milky Chance

1403
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,431
So

1404
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,455
What are you guys think

1405
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
There's a few things

1406
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,503
Hardware's Apopka

1407
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,295
You're always under margin pressure

1408
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:11,647
And that's never going to go away and you run the risk of having your business kind of blown up by

1409
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,439
Politically on Fallout trade Wars

1410
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:14,975
Be careful of

1411
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,743
You sign up for

1412
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,023
When we look at it

1413
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,583
As a professional chef I've been

1414
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,143
College 2001

1415
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,703
We have a long history that but we would all say

1416
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,239
Great books

1417
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,007
Only thing

1418
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,311
It could be smarter in your kitchen that could actually

1419
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,591
Do a better job

1420
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,919
Looking out on the hardware key or act

1421
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,967
Sibley developing tend to be complementary

1422
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:42,111
Technology so for example went on a Wednesday night TV may not be fast enough or you're just not in the mood for something that might be a protein

1423
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,135
Teen dominated milf

1424
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:43,903
The ark

1425
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:44,927
Free Technologies

1426
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:51,327
Do heat a meal that we think can be Mass Market that can be made shame and that you can deliver on some of the same core

1427
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,351
4 Promises of

1428
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,631
We guaranteed Foods

1429
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,703
Guarantee it's going to be relatively convenient to do it

1430
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,727
And we think there's

1431
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,263
Real meaning of ways that

1432
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,543
Better interfaces

1433
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,335
Facial interfaces machine learning

1434
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,359
Actually put

1435
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:06,687
Human Experience even more and make it easier for you to

1436
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,759
Which is really dark or metric Azara

1437
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,783
Customers choosing a cup

1438
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,551
Or they call you

1439
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,855
And we are looking at

1440
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,159
Bass we are saying how can we make it easier

1441
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:19,999
Pictures to cook on a Wednesday night we were playing with meal kits back in 20

1442
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,023
Tina's Chester

1443
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:24,095
Prototype then we beta-tested them with some of our community

1444
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,887
To love them

1445
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,935
We should have listened to we don't know when these

1446
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,471
Economics address look right side up

1447
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,751
So we had a team that's

1448
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:34,335
Started working on that bumper few years and they had a real break

1449
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:37,663
Late last year and in fact they've been building a pilot production

1450
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,687
Facility in Seattle

1451
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:42,527
1011 manufacturing the way they want to and we hope to have something to announce

1452
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
In a few weeks

1453
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:46,367
Ella comes out of beta but we really see this as a product

1454
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,951
Consumable space

1455
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:55,839
To choose to cook more frequently and have a greater diversity of options and have more compass

1456
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,423
Caviar

1457
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,703
I like that's your stand

1458
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:02,751
Okay

1459
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,031
Before we go

1460
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
Let's see

1461
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:05,567
What is your

1462
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:09,407
Favorite thing to sous vide and give us a recommendation

1463
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,687
For anybody who's

1464
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,455
A novice

1465
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
Austin saying

1466
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,551
So tell us what you like to do

1467
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:19,391
As a super duper complicated Chef person and then

1468
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,695
Maybe something to convince everyone else

1469
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,719
Sous vide might be

1470
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:26,559
Okay so for the meat lovers there's two things that are free

1471
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,583
Goat cheese for me

1472
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,863
Beef short rib

1473
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,399
You really want to get from ribs

1474
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:36,543
4 5 and 6 that doesn't mean anything to you go talk to a butcher it will mean something to them but that's the thickest part of the short rib

1475
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,591
You take that short ribs

1476
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:42,687
You cook it at 54 degrees Celsius or you pull our visual Douglas guidance

1477
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,711
Pictures of textures

1478
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,503
Little wind up with this for three days

1479
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527
That sounds crazy

1480
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,063
3 days book

1481
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,671
I promise you this is one of these dishes at tends to change people wise the first day and they have it

1482
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,951
Especially

1483
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,487
Is just so much more flavor

1484
00:54:55,743 --> 00:55:01,887
In a short Redmond sale ribeye or especially a flaming yawn but three days of cooking in a very low temperature Converse All That

1485
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:02,911
In the short rib

1486
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,703
The tender gelatin without making it

1487
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:07,775
Play Ear braised and you end up something is very steak like

1488
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,311
The tender filet mignon in

1489
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,359
Ugly delicious

1490
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,407
Play something more easy

1491
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,967
Weeknight you usually can find in supermarkets

1492
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:18,527
Pork shoulder steaks that usually at uppercut

1493
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,831
Flavorful but you drop those in the morning when you

1494
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,111
You go to work and

1495
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,391
Cook them they'll be

1496
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,183
Incredibly tender when you get home

1497
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,463
Perfect medium-rare

1498
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,255
Really it's hot pork should be cooked

1499
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,791
I really recommend adding up

1500
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,583
Char sui sauce to the bags

1501
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,935
Candy at the end for those who are not

1502
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
Beats

1503
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,239
Lentils and

1504
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,007
Asparagus

1505
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,567
Are just vegetables or grain preparation

1506
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:45,407
Can really benefit from CBD cooking chicken with the grain

1507
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,199
What's nice

1508
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,479
Leave them in the fridge

1509
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,759
Easily up to a month

1510
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:53,343
So you can have a really quick meal for together

1511
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
What you want

1512
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,903
And to get The Machinist out of them

1513
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,671
They're really great

1514
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,719
Beat you retain their natural sweetness

1515
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,743
Earthy flavors

1516
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,303
Little goat cheese for salad

1517
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,327
Maybe some toast it

1518
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,095
Conn's

1519
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,119
Classic restaurant

1520
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,399
Starter and it's delicious

1521
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,679
Asparagus

1522
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,215
Is one of these things where

1523
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,799
It really just needs to be lightly cooked you wanted to snap but you don't want it

1524
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,567
He stood

1525
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,383
You don't really want to cook it in anything other than it

1526
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,223
On juices maybe a knob of butter so asparagus is one of these things where

1527
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,247
It will be much better.

1528
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,831
Asparagus you typically getting a restaurant that has been steamed

1529
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,879
Color now in Gilbert

1530
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,927

1531
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:29,951
