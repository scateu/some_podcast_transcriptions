00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,624
That talks to me

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,392
Madam

00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
Stay tuned

33
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
For all of this

34
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,800
After a brief message from our sponsor

35
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
Today's podcast is sponsored by Leading smart home provider control for their smart home system connects all of your smart

36
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
Devices to make home control is easy as Alexa turn on movie time to lower your shades

37
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
Dim the lights and start Netflix on your TV or when the doorbell rings you can go into one app to see who it is

38
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
Turn on the porch light with control4 you can automate the devices you already have and keep adding new ones

39
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:48,032
Now that's smart head to control4.com Pest Control the number for

40
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800

41
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
For more information

42
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,384
Okay Kevin

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
We're going to start this off

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
With

45
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
Justin

46
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,248
Really Grim story in

47
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Honestly

48
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
I didn't think about this so

49
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,136
This weekend the New York Times did a story about how

50
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
People worrying

51
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,768
Abusive relationships how their abusers take advantage of smart home

52
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
Technology tool

53
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:14,144
Make their Partners lives even more difficult so they talk about setting the heat to lie

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
100 +

55
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,728
Locking people out of their house in

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
It sounds like a nightmare

57
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
This was

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,944
A really sad started to read it and it got me to rethink how I Implement devices in my own home with my family

59
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,272
Happy family there's no piece of relationship here

60
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
But

61
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
I again I rethought how I do things and how I communicate what devices I'm putting in place and why

62
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:43,840
And who has access and so on and so forth but if you're in an abusive relationship like this and

63
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,400
Your home is being turned against you whether it's

64
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,288
You're being listened to all the time monitor through your microphone enabled webcams or is she said

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
Thermostat changes that

66
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
Make the

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
You know you're home environment miserable or you're locked out of your house you know

68
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,504
There's no easy answer here to

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,600
Stop that from happening if you're in that situation and that's the scary part

70
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,416
Yashow Kevin is put up a story on the website

71
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
Talked about this a little bit

72
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,256
You know you mentioned

73
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Best way to

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,816
Do this is have access to your router

75
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
So you can

76
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:22,752
Yeah because it's a control thing this is all about control and if you don't have control over the devices if you can get

77
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,336
I control over the centralized point of communication for those devices

78
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
Meaning the router

79
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,272
Then you know at least you can see what devices are on the network and you may not even know that's the scary part.

80
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Could be being monitored

81
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
And not even know it

82
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:43,232
There could be hidden networks like we're putting place in you again don't know so access to the router I think

83
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
If you can and you would suggested

84
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Even

85
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,400
Hard resetting the router to stop devices from

86
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
Having access work at least temporarily

87
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
Yeah and this is

88
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Maybe

89
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,568
I don't know maybe you're packing to get out or something

90
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,128
I looked into hard reset

91
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
Isis and

92
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,736
The best option for someone who doesn't have access to the

93
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
Router or the apps are going to be

94
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Things that

95
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
Don't require you to have the app so

96
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
Nest for example

97
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
Are there thermostats

98
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
You can hard reset your nest which

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
Erase all your settings never

100
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
And this is not a great solution

101
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
Because whoever you're living with

102
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
You can just press your thermostat

103
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
Ring you open the

104
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
Under settings

105
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
Reset it

106
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
So

107
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
I'm pretty sure I can do that with the ecobee I have install as well and the whole point is you're looking for ways to reset these devices

108
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
Either without the app

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,647
Without access to the the app you know you may have the app which might not be able to do certain things to do administrative privileges

110
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,719
And if your Echo device you just pop a paperclip

111
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Into

112
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
The reset button

113
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,887
It depends on the device

114
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,191
But there's a little hole and if you stick up

115
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Paper clip in

116
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,007
The light Rings going to turn on and off

117
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
And then

118
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
You can't actually re-registered if you

119
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
I have the app on

120
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
But at least that

121
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Deregister

122
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
So

123
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
Factory resetting your loxism

124
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
A little harder you

125
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
I need the app for

126
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
August lock

127
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
That's because he's our outside

128
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
Your house and they don't want somebody

129
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
A thief could come in

130
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
Reset your lock

131
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:24,863
From the outside right you could it mean if you have the right tools you could actually remove and replace

132
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,191
That's a pretty extreme step with baby that is useful in

133
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
Your particular case it's hard to say

134
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:35,359
I mean you can rip out all the smart home care I called it the nuclear option but again

135
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
Crab repercussions when

136
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,479
The abuser finds out which they certainly will very quickly

137
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
So yeah

138
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Heidi Lynn

139
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Kevin and I

140
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,647
Because we have so much stuff in our homes I'll tell you my husband actually doesn't

141
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
Apps forever

142
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Iinstaller

143
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
I offer it to him

144
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
He's kind of

145
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,095
And I joke sometimes that he calls me

146
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
He can't

147
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
He's calling me when I'm out of town cuz

148
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
The lights don't work

149
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Never thought about that

150
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,079
Using that so Kevin came up with some

151
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
Basic good practices for

152
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Partners

153
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,247
It's not going to solve the main issue but

154
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
Youku

155
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,855
Potentially proactively avoid this issue if

156
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,159
Like I'm going to start doing more of

157
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
I plan to talk

158
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,279
About whatever device I plan to put on the network with my family

159
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,679
And offer them you know the same rights that I have first of all I want to make sure they understand what device is going

160
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
What it's going to do

161
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,799
What information is going to gather and send to me or to them you know if they choose to

162
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:41,663
Accept the invitation the app and that way they understand exactly what's here

163
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
Because he'll know what

164
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
Could potentially be used against them

165
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,807
God forbid something happened in our relationship

166
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,647
Yeah I just want them to have the same information and rice that I have

167
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
Again I would never plan to do this but I want them to

168
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
Joe comfortable with everything in their house

169
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:02,399
And if they're not I've decided you know what I'm just gonna start putting stuff in my home office where they typically don't go

170
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:09,055
Man that's fine for testing and I may not be able to get all the features and so on so forth you know but that's okay they need to be comfortable in their own home

171
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,895
So proactively those are two of the steps that I'll be taken with my family

172
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,943
Yes and I've always done that

173
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
Like my daughter actually doesn't want smart thing

174
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,551
Bedroom she's told me

175
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
Looks like no just don't install it

176
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
Okay.

177
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
Not until she does have an echo

178
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
Because she wants

179
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
And now she has a smart

180
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Because she

181
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
But she had to come out

182
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
So yeah

183
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
There's no easy solution air

184
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
Yeah this is

185
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
People

186
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,079
That is on that so let us talk now about

187
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
W

188
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Re

189
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
Wi-Fi Alliance announced this week

190
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
A new security protocol

191
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Free wifi

192
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:59,231
It's about time since WPA2 has had its fair share of soles for quite some time in

193
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:05,631
It was back in 2011 that the Wi-Fi protected setup that button you would hit that would scan

194
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:11,263
For devices you hit the button on your router and pet access to all the new devices on network that could be Brute Force

195
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,847
Pact with as little as 11,000 guesses of the PIN

196
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Which

197
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,407
That's not very secure for a

198
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
Protected secure

199
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
Set up so this is long overdue

200
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Yes

201
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
And

202
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Vacation

203
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
And it's actually been used in mesh net

204
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Other people's

205
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Now

206
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
This is going to

207
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,327
Address of The Brute Force attack issues so that'll be nice

208
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
And

209
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
The downside to this is

210
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
Chant

211
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,031
It's not an existing router so

212
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
If you want this

213
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
Going to have to buy some

214
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,431
Which if you just got it Like Us excited about mesh routers

215
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
You just bought a metro

216
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
What

217
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Terror

218
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,207
Two things that I would say one it's a perfect time for her router makers time

219
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,607
Introduce Smart Hub Smart's two routers because now they're going to have a whole upgrade wave of routers

220
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
Even if you

221
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,543
Buying new device that supports wpa3 and I believe LG smartphones will support

222
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,127
This year it's okay because that will always fall back

223
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
To WPA2

224
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,063
So you won't have all the new security features of wpa3 but you don't necessarily need to

225
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,623
Upgrade your router to still use the device on your home network

226
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
Yes and if you buy these

227
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
New Riders

228
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Nothing else to think

229
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
It is backwards compatible

230
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
But

231
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
Someone to what extent

232
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
Fluorite

233
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
But in other news for iot

234
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,615
People the Wi-Fi Alliance also introducing the

235
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Easy Connect

236
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
Which is really nice

237
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,503
Because basically you snap a picture of a QR code

238
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
And then you can

239
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
Connect a device to

240
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
Your WiFi

241
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
And that's that's good that's actually how you connect certain devices to your network today I know that

242
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,327
There's a QR code on the bottom of Google home Mini

243
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,983
Homekit devices have a numerical but also you can scan a QR code to app so that makes total sense

244
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
Sakura witch

245
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
They say it is we will see

246
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
I'm sure someone

247
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
How long till attack

248
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
All right

249
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
Tesla

250
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
They have a new

251
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
Pricing model

252
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,367
For data so anybody who has a test

253
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
Mary called it

254
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
You basically had

255
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,255
I know when I bought mine they would like to have four years of data free

256
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,351
And then you'll have to pay for it and I'm like how much is it there like we don't know yet

257
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
Okay

258
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
I hope

259
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,615
So I've been actually Loki worrying about that for a while cuz you know the

260
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
They kind of have me over

261
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
Barrel I totally need internet

262
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
Connectivity for

263
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
My car

264
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,551
A lot of the functions that has relies not just on Wi-Fi

265
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
In my garage but also cellular

266
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
So

267
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
How's it going to work

268
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,279
Apparently people who bought their cars will not have to

269
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
If you were buying a new one

270
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
No you get a certain amount of time

271
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167
Use basic data

272
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
And that will always be

273
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,263
But if you want to use like real time

274
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Traffic

275
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Views if you want to do

276
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
Do you like Street View maps

277
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
Data-intensive app

278
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
Applications

279
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
Then you will pay

280
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
$100

281
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:38,879
So for the basic you'll like still be able to get maps and routing you just won't get say the traffic the real time

282
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Hondata

283
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,255
So your car will still function and do lovely things for you it just won't be

284
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
I'll tell you that

285
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
Traffic

286
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
But you do have it on your phone so

287
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
Yeah I mean

288
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:56,031
If there's something I couldn't get on my phone then I would consider getting this if I had a test what would I do not

289
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
I wonder

290
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,847
If you can connect

291
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,175
Your car to your phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot

292
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07,039
In which case you don't need to pay the $100 a year but it is a little clunky

293
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
Now also

294
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,879
It includes the fancy package

295
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
Including car streaming

296
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
Media and music so

297
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
Prior to that it's been

298
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
And also the intern

299
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Which I personally have

300
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
I have never used in my

301
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
But

302
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
Yeah

303
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,543
Let me know how many people drive without the phone I know I don't think there's a big push to move certain smartphone

304
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
Activities while you're on-the-go

305
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,639
Saline to the car so you can leave the phone behind

306
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,943
Nobody's more conveniently

307
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
Like being able to skip a song

308
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
You know and have it

309
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
Run from 1 places

310
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Supposed to on your phone

311
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
It's kind of nice

312
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,671
There's a huge screen in your Tesla so

313
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
If you're navigating

314
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
When you want to look

315
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
For real-time nav

316
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
You know for real time

317
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Traffic

318
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
It's nice to look

319
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
17 in

320
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Sitting right there

321
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,215
Bissell you're going to pay $100 a year for

322
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,263
Is a convenience factor I'd say

323
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,383
But I like this model I think it's good because there is a lot of things that were unlike

324
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
How are you going to prove

325
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
Activity for these things

326
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Is it having

327
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,367
Some of these devices it's very easy to say hey it's a water sensor it's a wake-up this many times

328
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
X many bytes of data

329
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
So for that

330
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
I

331
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
Could price that into

332
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Vice really well

333
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
Right I have a good sense of

334
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
What's going to happen

335
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
With some of the devices that have screens or

336
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
Things like that

337
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
It does become a little dicey

338
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
Like you can't really effective

339
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
Sleep rice that

340
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,287
Into the hardware cost of the

341
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
Device when someone buys

342
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
So this is kind

343
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,687
Gives you the functionality that you

344
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Expect for

345
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Your device

346
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
Then offers you

347
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
It's your things

348
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:48,415
Yeah and they're not limiting how long you can use those fancy things if you want to stream

349
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
Audio near car over the web

350
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
You could do that

351
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:56,863
Theoretically 7 by 24 not that you would and you're not paying like overages or anything like that

352
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
So

353
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
I like this

354
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
Nautica

355
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
Crazy thing I like

356
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
Tiered structure there

357
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
I think we'll see

358
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,175
I don't know how many subscriptions I'm going to end up

359
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Okay

360
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,599
Yes finally I mean I don't remember when

361
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,999
Amazon announced that's what they had said prior that they're bringing Madam a voice support to iOS

362
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,303
And they did this week and I tested it

363
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,703
So in the matter of a app there is no a button that you just tap and you don't need to say matinee or you just

364
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,335
Ask a question or say a command and she behaves just like she would in an echo device right on your iPhone

365
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:45,503
It's not always listening thing Apple will probably never allow that for right third-party digital assistant

366
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
I totally get that

367
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
One thing though I think

368
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,927
That Amazon is missing the boat on and hopefully there's an update to do this soon

369
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
A lot of iPhones have

370
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Force Touch where you can

371
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:02,399
Hard press the screen on an app icon and get alternative options in all kinds of different things and if I do that on my

372
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
Google assistant app for iOS

373
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,007
There's a button that says speak to your Google assist

374
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
They don't do that for

375
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,919
Manamea on the anime app so I think it would be helpful to you just don't have to open the app that way

376
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
You just push press

377
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
So other than that

378
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
Works great

379
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,575
Took him forever to come out with it I don't know what took so long

380
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
Got it I don't understand

381
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,903
Use case for this but maybe it's cuz I don't have my phone

382
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,207
All the time I'm like I just shouted out

383
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
I guess it's 4 p.m.

384
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:31,583
No I mean if you're not at home and you want to turn on

385
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
Things that are connected to a matinee

386
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,567
You know or see who's home or you know what there's a ton of anything that she's connected to at home and you want to access remotely

387
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
We should be able to do this way

388
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
OkCupid

389
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
That is like

390
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
We talked about this

391
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
A couple

392
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
Weeks ago the wise camera

393
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
And

394
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
After I wrote cuz I was just

395
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Appointed that I couldn't

396
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Turn it off

397
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
I have like five people

398
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
I just plug it into a smart outlet

399
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
Then I

400
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
Sounds like

401
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
Target

402
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
Who is like me and just

403
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Didn't see that

404
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
Thank you

405
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Thank you

406
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Twitter

407
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
Did see it and

408
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
Kind enough to put it out

409
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
Smart listeners

410
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
Smart listeners and connect

411
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
So let's talk about basic news

412
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
. actually I think

413
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,511
We got a smart

414
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Stent

415
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,839
This is the device you stick in your

416
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
And it

417
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
Holds your arteries open

418
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
Text several people

419
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
They are

420
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:48,127
Lovely except for they get clogged up just like your arteries do in

421
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
How to come out

422
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
Another surgery in

423
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
So this one

424
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,927
You this is wild this tent was created or designed to actually act as a large antenna

425
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
So

426
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:08,351
The stent itself the tubular stent is made up of wiring that just goes around and around around a form

427
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
Understand and there's a pressure monitor

428
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,703
Attached to this and that measures

429
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,335
I presume you the blood flow or the pressure on the artery and because of the antenna

430
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,407
That pressure information can be monitored

431
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,759
Exactly exactly

432
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:31,903
I look at this and it looks like a caterpillar to me because of the way it's designed with the whole design is an antenna that's just amazing

433
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Research project

434
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
Not actually out

435
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
You got to see it

436
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Okay

437
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
The company called

438
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Gets

439
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
24 million in

440
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
These guys on my podcast

441
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,383
They have their sensors attached

442
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431
Google Street View cars in

443
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,711
And we're measuring pollution in

444
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
It was a great project

445
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
I loved it because it talks about

446
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
Having air quality monitor

447
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
Ring sensors

448
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
Lower level is really

449
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
Because a lot of cities put them

450
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
Way high up

451
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
People are breathing

452
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
So

453
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,143
That's one into being able to track

454
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Very granular

455
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
Air pollutants

456
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
AR

457
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,495
How cities planned

458
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,055
Better so you can say oh my gosh this intersection is

459
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
Horribly

460
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
Let's see what we

461
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
We can do to improve traffic flow

462
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
In this area for exam

463
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
Maybe we just plant more

464
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
So

465
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,271
I like what they're doing

466
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
They

467
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
Raised

468
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,903
More sensors are more cars and more places in

469
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
I love it

470
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
And

471
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,231
That is what I

472
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
Very cool

473
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
Meanwhile in Buda

474
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
He municipal smartness

475
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,191
Yes Meme

476
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,007
In Sydney Australia they are

477
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,799
Linksmart Park

478
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,103
Benches and I love this because

479
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,919
All of the benches and surrenders tables as well

480
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
Have sensors in them

481
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:05,599
That basically determine if the bench is being used if it's broken

482
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:11,487
That allows the local municipality to a keep track of

483
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,327
Any upkeep they need to do and get it taken care of faster but also

484
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
Tell them

485
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,167
How to better design public spaces right

486
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,959
What about that says

487
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:27,359
It's there's no user data collected Noah I'd personally identifiable user information it's not saying that Kevin is

488
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,919
Sitting on this bench and sat there from this time to this time

489
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,711
It's just saying that someone did

490
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,759
And that's pretty rare that we have

491
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,599
Batters new security issue here from a personal privacy standpoint

492
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
So that is brilliant

493
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:44,511
I would love to see more places to this I don't know how much it cost but it shouldn't be that expensive to add these

494
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,607
Pressure sensors and such to park benches and tables

495
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,959
Very curious to see what kind of data they get out of it and one for me how they use the data in the future

496
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
And now we'll move from smart

497
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Park benches

498
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
Too smart

499
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
Faucets

500
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
So

501
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Delta

502
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,175
We got very excited about this

503
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
As we saw it

504
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Imat ces

505
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Delta makes a

506
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,551
Bi-weekly means face

507
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,671
No it is it is it was cooler when I actually saw it

508
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,511
Retrofit kit

509
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,791
Touch2o faucet

510
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
The retrofit

511
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
Vitamin A

512
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
Faucet so this means it will talk to you

513
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,775
Everyone's like what why would I care

514
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
But I'm going to tell you why you

515
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,103
So I did this in

516
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,151
Back when we talked about it originally the

517
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,687
Pricing was about five hundred

518
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
Dollars was

519
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Plan pricing

520
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
For this for a total faucet

521
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
And adding

522
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,599
AC replace your existing

523
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,623
Faucet with this

524
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
Touch to Dada

525
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,439
Capacitive touch faucet

526
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,719
Which I also

527
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,255
Just means to turn it on

528
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,119
So I happen to have a capacitive touch faucet

529
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
He said it would be about

530
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
102

531
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,287
$120 but it is not on the market

532
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Get this is a beta

533
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,591
They really wanted

534
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,127
Let me try it cuz I am soaked

535
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,407
Crazy about this kind of stuff

536
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
And by they wanted

537
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,527
Stacy really try it means Stacy really want to try and they said okay

538
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
So this is

539
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,952
Is not something you can buy

540
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
Eventually

541
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,048
I think it could be if we're going to have dealt actually to come on the show in a cup

542
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
The faucet

543
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
Installing it

544
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
Looked so scary

545
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,240
You guys cuz you had to turn off the water in

546
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,080
And you need to have power underneath your sink cuz

547
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,616
This is wifi-enabled

548
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,408
Wi-Fi sucks juice like

549
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,968
Business so beforehand I had batteries

550
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Power Ranger

551
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Batteries

552
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Not enough

553
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
So

554
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
I put under my sink

555
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
I do have power

556
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
Because I have a

557
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
Garbage disposal

558
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
In the dishwasher

559
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Running off of

560
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
That's so yay for

561
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
I turn off the water in basic

562
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
Glee you just

563
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
I just remove

564
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,864
One module that was in between

565
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
Pipes and I stuck two more

566
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,704
Then I connect as a little ethernet

567
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,032
Because thanks need ethernet now you guys

568
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,312
And

569
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,848
Can you basically

570
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
Tested

571
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,176
And then you connect it to

572
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,456
Remind me account

573
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
And

574
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
I had a little trouble

575
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
Connecting

576
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,576
When it's set up a soft access point

577
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
And basically was like trying to

578
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,904
Connect the faucet itself

579
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
But I work through that

580
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512
It was a weird glitch

581
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
And then

582
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,144
I was able to

583
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
Tell Madam a

584
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,496
Hey so hey. Ma ask Delta to turn on water

585
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Turn on

586
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Turn off

587
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,592
And there's about a 4 second delay

588
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
So this is not a great option

589
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
You know you're saying supper

590
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
May just run over faster

591
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
But is really cool

592
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
You can do things like

593
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,344
Hey Madam a ask Delta to dispense to

594
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,160
Does it does it does it accurately

595
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
It's awesome

596
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,488
You actually just heard the problem with

597
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,536
But this Witch is it's really hard to

598
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
Number to ask Delta

599
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,888
Yeah that's a problem with a lot of these skills

600
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Yeah

601
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,704
So I struggle with my

602
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Words

603
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,824
I struggle with my words like your words use your words

604
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,640
Once we got it down

605
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,408
Using it

606
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,944
Not as often as I thought we

607
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
But we do use it to

608
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
Phil

609
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Things that

610
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
Are large

611
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
And you don't want to

612
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
You know like I don't want to stand there

613
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,160
Like a gallon of water

614
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,720
So I can just stick the bucket under there and just

615
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,256
Tell it to dispense a gallon

616
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,328
You can also go to the Delta website

617
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,864
There is not an app

618
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,168
Go to the Delta website

619
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,960
Dragon / 2

620
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Home screen

621
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,336
But it shows you your

622
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,872
Check your water usage history so

623
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
So you can see how many gallons of water

624
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
Use for that sink

625
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
Canidae which is kind of

626
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
We'll see if you're building a new house I would

627
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
Totally put this in

628
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,392
You can do custom

629
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:00,256
Type Phillips to like if you have a water bottle that has x amount of ounces capacity you could

630
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
Shortcut that

631
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,376
Yes so I did create a shortcut I have a vase that I used to fill

632
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
Are fish tank

633
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Water evaporate

634
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Take it slow

635
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
Can you treat the water in the

636
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,824
Right now I have a big face and it needs

637
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
11 + 1/2

638
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Cups of water

639
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
So instead of saying 11 and 1/2

640
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,200
Half cup Cypress to set base

641
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
As my

642
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,504
A program database

643
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
And so now I just say

644
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
Matinee

645
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
Ask Delta

646
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
To fill

647
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
Face

648
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Nice

649
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,720
I have one question

650
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
The ethernet port

651
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,840
Is on the module that YouTube retrofitted

652
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,288
I'm just wondering if I need an ethernet port in my kitchen or something they connect to each other there's a module that controls

653
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
The capacitive

654
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,592
Touched and there's a module

655
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Controls

656
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,784
Okay so no concern there of not having total airports in the kitchen you do not need

657
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
I liked

658
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
My family so far seems to

659
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,072
My daughter thinks it's a little silly but yeah she thinks a lot of the stuff

660
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
Banana silly song

661
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,912
There we have it and you'll learn more about it

662
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
I'll have a review up after living with

665
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
Sand

00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Also have

667
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,200
Before we go to our voicemail you know what your daughter won't think is silly

668
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,832
That the Google home can now speak Spanish and I know she speak Spanish

669
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112

Expect can habla Espanol

671
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,256
And we know this because

672
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,024
WeChat

Right before the show

674
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,680
Trying to speak Spanish and it did not go well but the Google home doesn't work that way.

Spanish

679
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Elsa speaks

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152

How is from Shannon

710
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
This message is from Shannon

711
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,608
I'm interested in getting the Abode home security system

712
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,680
Just wondering if you had any recommendation for sensors

713
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:53,056
Sickly store sensors window sensors baby garage door sensors sunlight

714
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,920
Anything that you guys could recommend that goes with the systems also have apple homekit

715
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,688
Thanks

716
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,968
Oceanian

717
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
This is one of those

718
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,784
Why is the smart home so hard

719
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
The questions

720
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
It's a good one

721
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Wonderful

722
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
At home security

723
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,208
Yeah we're going to tackle this into pieces

724
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
Because

725
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
There are two pieces

726
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:18,400
They don't work together so actually will just tell you to give up on the home

727
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,424
KIPP dream

728
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,472
Talk a little bit about this as we

729
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
Used

730
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
The Abode

731
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,616
Worse with lots of devices and they have a wonderful

732
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
List

733
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,664
On their website so I'll put

734
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Link to that

735
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,456
In the show notes

736
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,736
Of the devices

737
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,760
Is it safe to test

738
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Works with both

739
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
Z-Wave Danzig

740
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,368
I noticed on there that they had the

741
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
Aeons

742
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,184
I love those

743
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
I think they're really good

744
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
Dancing very attract

745
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,024
They have

746
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
One of the and or sense

747
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,864
Gen 5 in that is a recessed door sensor

748
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656
Answer so you can actually install that

749
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Insider

750
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,704
Torso you

751
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
Holypop

752
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,032
And then you don't have these like we're

753
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Weird things on it

754
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Exterior

755
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
And makes

756
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,712
Water sensors door sensors

757
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,504
They do make light bulbs

758
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
Wouldn't be excited about that

759
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
So I wouldn't go there

760
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
For that

761
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,368
But I also saw that

762
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
That they have

763
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
The linear

764
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
Garage door

765
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
Which you would

766
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
About that

767
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,000
Kevin

768
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
What do you think about it

769
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,888
I like it it's very easy to install it's literally just adding

770
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,936
Plugging it into a power port

771
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,520
Jack and then connecting two wires to your garage door opener

772
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,544
You made a ladder

773
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Probably

774
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,896
Unless you're really tall on like me but it's not a daunting install at all

775
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
It works very well

776
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
Correct

777
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,600
Is easy you mentioned door locks they have

778
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
This works actually with

779
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
Kwikset door

780
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
Blocks the Z-Wave

781
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,952
Kwikset door locks I have those

782
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
They're fine

783
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,024
It also works with the Schlage door locks

784
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,328
And I'm not saying this because they sponsor this

785
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,400
Their door lock quality is better

786
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
So

787
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,216
I would probably go with that if

788
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
That you're seriously concerned about

789
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,312
But it only works with the Z-Wave

790
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,616
So this is where it gets can

791
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,408
Using because Slade also Mesa

792
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:12,576
Louis Facebook swell several of these vendors make homekit devices that are not compatible and the reason

793
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,368
People understand

794
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,904
Very simple reason

795
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,744
Homekit only supports to radio protocols WiFi and Bluetooth

796
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,536
So you're never going to find

797
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:25,120
At least today a Z-Wave or zigbee device that works with

798
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,192
Myself so that's the issue

799
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,216
It is

800
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
And

801
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,312
It also works with Nest devices ecobee devices

802
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,616
It works with your Amazon Echo

803
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
It works with Google

804
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
So there's

805
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,456
A lot of things this is going

806
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
You're not going to have

807
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
That cool ability on your iPhone

808
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
Look and see who's at your

809
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,136
So that is

810
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
But that's what it works with

811
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,232
And it actually seems really

812
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,256
Good in

813
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,536
Again a lot of people

814
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,072
Like the security system so

815
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352

And we talked a lot about the legal

837
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
Background here

838
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,936

Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

857
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
Is Syracuse

858
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,232
Barbar who is the author of a book called

859
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:30,816
Habeas data and a reporter with ARs Technica

860
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,352
Hi Siri how are you doing

861
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,376
Hey what's going on

862
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,936
Man I am super excited about this be

863
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,520
Because I spent a lot of time thinking about all the crazy Gadget

864
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,288
Json stuff that I can

865
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,872
Can put in my house and I spend very little time talking about

866
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:48,224
What this means in the big picture for people's privacy and

867
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
What it means with the lawn for

868
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,064
So I am happy to have you on the show quickly

869
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,136
Tell me a little bit about what the book is and why

870
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:02,048
Chores for the book yeah it's called habeas data privacy vs the rise of surveillance Tech it covers 50 years of service

871
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:06,144
Valence law history in America so the book is mostly about 10 legal cases

872
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,264
Mostly Supreme Court not 100% but mostly starting with chapter 1 which is a case called

873
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,616
Cats versus United States which the Supreme Court decided in 1960

874
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,176
57 or we are getting 1967 engine take

875
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:24,064
And this involves a guy in Los Angeles and Sunset Boulevard who was using pay phones to

876
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,464
Make illegal gambling phone calls and the police put a recording device on top of the phone booths

877
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,744
That he was using

878
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,048
To do that they didn't have a warrant for that

879
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,328
They captured his voice

880
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,936
While he was in the phone booth and ultimately the Supreme Court ruled that this was not okay

881
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
Mistreated this phrase

882
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,520
Call a reasonable expectation of privacy

883
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
Cease of the Supreme Court sad

884
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:51,456
That when you step into a phone booth just as when you are at home or in a hotel room or in a few other places you have a quote reasonable expectation of

885
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:55,552
Privacy to be free from government surveillance and if the government doesn't want us to reveal you

886
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
They need a warrant

887
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,648
To do so that's part of the legal underpinning

888
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,720
For a number of cases that I write about in the book

889
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,768
And many others that have provided

890
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,864
Sort of a framework for understanding how the courts think about

891
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,656
Surveillance over the last half-century

892
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
Biscuits case

893
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,008
Set up this idea of this reasonable expectation of

894
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
Privacy and the rest of the book

895
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:22,688
Spend a lot of time exploring how that intersects with technology so you talk about things like

896
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,784
Real-time location data you talk about thermal imagery applied outside

897
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,880
If homes there's wiretapping there's a lot of technical

898
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,952
Innovations that are currently still being addressed by the

899
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:39,840
You actually in the book talking about a case that just was decided last week at the Supreme Court

900
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,376
Can you tell me a little bit about that

901
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:48,032
Yeah so that's a case called Carpenter vs United States and it involves a guy by the name of Little Tim Carpenter who is

902
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,592
Is involved in a gang of men operating

903
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:54,432
Primarily in Michigan and Ohio back in 2010 and 2011

904
00:33:54,688 --> 00:34:00,832
That were sticking up Radio Shacks and cell phone stores they were after the latest models of iPhones and Android

905
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,160
And the government in that case was able

906
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,744
To go to a company in this case MetroPCS and Sprint

907
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,144
And require them to turn over to the government the phone record specifically What's called the cell site location information

908
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,496
In other words we're Littleton Carpenter's phone was and by extension where he was

909
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,824
In this case over the course of a hundred and twenty seven days

910
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:28,224
I got they didn't have to have a warrant to do this and so the question that the Supreme Court this time was being asked to answer why

911
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:34,880
Is that okay is it okay for the government to obtain such a large volume of data about somebody more than a hundred and twenty

912
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,416
20 days worth of data about somebody

913
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:43,072
That not only show that yes he was at the scenes of the various crimes but also you know that he was at church on Sunday that he was at

914
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:47,936
At a relative's house on another day and that he went to buy coffee in a different day and you know he did lots of other things

915
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,776
That had nothing to do with the crimes that he was accused of committing did the government

916
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,312
Need a warrant to get all of that

917
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,872
Data to find out all of those things about

918
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
Tim Carpenter

919
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,944
The Supreme Court in a five to four ruling

920
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,808
Said yes the government does need a warrant that location data here is different

921
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,904
Then other kinds of data that the government might have been able to previously obtained

922
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,512
So now presumably law enforcement agencies all over the country are now trying to figure out

923
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,584
How to adjust their policies and practices

924
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,864
To deal with this new reality

925
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
Now

926
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,424
This feels like yes

927
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Awesome

928
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:26,592
But in reading about this it sounds like there's actually a lot of limits in the court didn't kind of didn't talk about Gathering

929
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
During the state of

930
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,128
Overtime or

931
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,456
How long they would have this data they left a lot of things open

932
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
Open so I'd love to get your

933
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:39,648
So yeah so if you read the decision and it's long it's about a hundred and twenty Pages including all of the descendants

934
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,000
So in the majority opinion which was written by Chief Justice John Roberts

935
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
The court seemed to suggest

936
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,560
You know that the government

937
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:52,960
Certainly needed a warrant to obtain data that was more than over the course of more than six days so the government wanted to come out

938
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:58,592
After myself at location information for more than 6 days they certainly needed at work Beyond.

939
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:03,456
Before that they probably need a warrant but they so it was a little bit fuzzy in the way it was written

940
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:09,856
The dissenters sort of seized upon that and said yo the Six-Day rule is very arbitrary why is it take days and not 5 or so

941
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,136
7 we don't know

942
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
But

943
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
We don't know yet

944
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,744
Exactly what that's going to mean in practice

945
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,144
Presumably you know presuming that law enforcement agencies are following the Supreme Court's guidance here is that it just means that it

946
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,704
It's a little bit harder now for law enforcement

947
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
To get all of this

948
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:31,872
Information right now they have to show probable cause which is not that hard to get right judges sign off

949
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,408
Off on probable cause warrant

950
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,224
Literally every day around this country so it's not

951
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,088
Difficult but it certainly requires the police to do a little bit more legwork upfront

952
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
But you know it's very early still this issue just came out a few days ago so we don't exactly know yet what the full Wrath

953
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
Ramifications of Adar

954
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,096
True okay let's break some Concepts down from the book

955
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:55,936
That I think are worth talking about before we actually get into like smart home

956
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,240
Which is what is idea of

957
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
D orders

958
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
Warrants

959
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:03,360
Super warrants because these are all like the standards of

960
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,128
Proof that

961
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,200
The right government establishment has to show Buffet

962
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,224
For getting the data

963
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
So talk to me about that

964
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,904
Sure it's a deodorant which is named for a particular section of the store to medications act which is a federal law

965
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,672
All that governs

966
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,464
How the governments in Access

967
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,864
This particular data and what standard they need to show a d order merely requires relevancy to an Envoy

968
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
Going investigate

969
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,984
That's pretty low and that's pretty broad generally there's no real issue there

970
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:36,384
So we've gone now with respect to cell site location information data we've gone now from this do you order standard relevancy

971
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,016
Too probable cause right side that's a standard well-known framework that is in 4th amendment law

972
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:47,392
Criminal defense unit going back for a very long time right this is a well-known understanding of what that means

973
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,696
That the government has to show probable cause

974
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:56,096
That there is evidence of a crime that if they search somebody's home or somebody's phone or whatever it is that they're going to find evidence of a

975
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:01,216
The crime a super warrant as you mentioned a moment ago isn't even higher standard right and

976
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,056
To be clear the term super warrant is a nickname that lawyers have given

977
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:09,408
For what the government has to show when it wants to obtain a wiretap order

978
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,944
So if anybody has ever watched

979
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,992
Universe TV shows or movies

980
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:19,392
The most notably the wire you probably remember that the character in The Wire of Jimmy McNulty spends a lot of time go

981
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,184
Going to this Baltimore judge

982
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,232
Asking for wiretap orders

983
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:27,840
On particular phones that the you know fictional criminal gang in that show

984
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,888
Are using to conduct their drug-dealing up

985
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:35,008
The reason why they're called super warrants oftentimes in the real world is because

986
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,312
In order to get a wiretap order

987
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,128
The police law enforcement has to show to the judge

988
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,712
That conventional surveillance either has already failed

989
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
Would fail

990
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,040
Or would be too dangerous to undertale

991
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,088
Right so you can imagine for example

992
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:55,488
Trying to infiltrate like a gang or a mafia-type organization or something like that where it would be extremely difficult

993
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:01,888
If not outright impossible for them to do that and they have to swear in a document write affidavit to the judge that really

994
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
Play this is the ultimate Last Resort

995
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:07,776
And this is the only way that we're going to be able to bust these bad guys is if we wiretapped

996
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:11,104
Stop listening in on somebody's phone calls

997
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,432
It's pretty invasive I think all of us kind of inherently understand that

998
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:18,528
So the government has to clear a pretty high bar in order to be able to

999
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:24,416
Be granted a wiretap and in the federal court system the federal courts actually publish annual statistics

1000
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,208
It's showing how often

1001
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,744
Set wiretap orders are granted

1002
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,072
Wiretaps have been allowed under the lawn out

1003
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:37,472
For 50 years and we've lived under with all the wiretap ACT also known as title 3 for 50 years now and so

1004
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:43,872
So we have a pretty good sense of how that works and you know this guy hasn't fallen right the fact that the government has to go

1005
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,920
3D Dexter Hoops doesn't seem to be

1006
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,944
A big barrier

1007
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,320
Okay and now that we talked about warrants this gets into possibly the big macro theme

1008
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:58,464
The book if I'm thinking about it which is this idea of metadata versus content so a wiretap for example

1009
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,512
Is getting my actual content of my

1010
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,072
But in several of the cases that you write about

1011
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:09,472
What government is actually getting is just a record of the phone calls like the numbers called or what time someone called

1012
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,032
The courts seem pretty okay with

1013
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,336
The government getting access to lots of metadata

1014
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:18,688
Talk about that sure so if we go back to the 1970s

1015
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:25,088
There's a famous case that I read about the book called Smith versus Maryland Smith versus Maryland is one of two cases that form the under

1016
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:29,696
Painting of another fun super catchy legal phrase known as the third party Doctrine

1017
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,512
The third party Doctrine comes out of this case

1018
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,584
Smith vs Maryland and also case called United States vs Miller

1019
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,680
Richmond vs Maryland basically involves a woman who gets

1020
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:46,080
Bugs on her doorstep at midnight in Baltimore in the 1970s and the man who robbed her

1021
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:52,480
Also decided in His Infinite Wisdom that he also was going to make harassing phone calls against her from in some cases

1022
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
Sit home and in other cases

1023
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,040
Nearby payphones

1024
00:40:55,296 --> 00:41:01,440
Hopefully the police in that case were able to obtain a court order to get his car record using a device

1025
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,464
Vice called a pen register

1026
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,024
Again we would maybe today call this

1027
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,424
A call log or just metadata righteous essentially showing that he called her at these particular times for you know the

1028
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
This number of minutes

1029
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:18,592
You know he challenged the fact that the government was able to obtain these call records again without a warrant and also

1030
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:24,992
Julian Smith versus Maryland the Supreme Court decided that no that's not a violation of the Fourth Amendment you don't

1031
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:30,112
I need a warrant to access these types of car records as you say this is a sort of metadata versus

1032
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,648
Just content type of Distinction

1033
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:36,512
So that the idea there is that you know the third-party in Smith versus Maryland was

1034
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:42,912
The local phone company in that case and because he used that company to effectuate his calls to call her

1035
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,216
That he had given up a privacy interest

1036
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
In the fact that he

1037
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,032
He had called her because he used the phone company

1038
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:52,895
Need to do it and so then the phone company could give up those call records to government or to anybody else

1039
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:59,295
To type you don't more to the modern-day right this is exactly the kind of question that this room Court was facing in Carpenter

1040
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:03,135
Was was this an instance where has the government argued

1041
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:07,999
That accompany could be compelled to hand over Hall records or in this case location records

1042
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:08,767
Of carpenter

1043
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,583
In the Supreme Court's decision in Carpenter

1044
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
The majority found that

1045
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,191
The csli the cell site location information

1046
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:22,591
Was basically to private and too personal and you know went too far it was more than just a couple days

1047
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
Call records

1048
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,919
It was in this case 227 days

1049
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:30,527
Literally everywhere this guy went and so they said that that's too invasive

1050
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:36,927
So in this particular case they said that the government had gone too far but the court took great pains to say we're not

1051
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,695
Overturning

1052
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:41,023
This third party Doctrine we're not saying that that is

1053
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:44,095
Not good law they said you know it still persists

1054
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,143
In other areas but in this case

1055
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:52,543
Where were talking about such a large volume of location information coming from a cell phone we're going to say that the third project

1056
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
Doesn't apply

1057
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:58,943
Alright so now that I feel like we've gotten a basic legal education which was probably a bit much for every

1058
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,479
But worth it

1059
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
Let's talk about

1060
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:03,807
Smart Home

1061
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,391
Because to me everything that we're doing

1062
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,671
In the internet today

1063
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
We're obviously leaving these

1064
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,487
Digital footprint says what

1065
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
What people liked called

1066
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,047
But it's scary because

1067
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:20,447
This is a huge amount of data about individuals that is stored in perpetuity or for however long accompanied

1068
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:24,287
Deems it wants it and it's accessible in searchable by

1069
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,823
Apple computers which is on

1070
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
Resident

1071
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:31,711
So keeping all of that and we're bringing it closer and closer into our homes with

1072
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,247
Very little understanding of what

1073
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,295
Doing so let's talk about

1074
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,623
The devices that scare you the most or that you think are

1075
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,159
The most rate for

1076
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
Government overreach

1077
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,231
You know all of these

1078
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:49,375
Smart home devices and I'll admit I don't know nearly enough about the Myriad of devices that are out there in comparison to you

1079
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:55,775
But from the ones that I am aware of you know the Amazon Echo or the Google smart home devices are the Apple smart home device

1080
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:00,639
Is or even just something even more basic like a video you know baby monitor for example

1081
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:04,479
To me there have been you know numerous instances of

1082
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,807
Certainly questionable situations where whether it's

1083
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:13,951
Some miscreant out in the world you know hacking a baby monitor to say awful things to a young child

1084
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,255
All the way up to you know there was a case

1085
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:22,655
Just last year I believe it was we're in Arkansas in a murder trial the government wanted Amazon to turnover record

1086
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:29,055
Heard from an Alexa that was present near the scene of a murder as a way to try to get at what either the victim or

1087
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:33,663
The alleged perpetrator had said in the minutes prior to the murder

1088
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:37,247
And you know this came up a little bit in some listeners may remember

1089
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:43,647
Just a couple years ago there was this so-called FBI versus Apple Showdown that involved a locked iPhone in the wake of The Sandbar

1090
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:50,047
Bernardino terrorist attack here in California and one of the arguments that Apple made was you know sort of what I would call

1091
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:54,911
OB If You Give a Mouse a Cookie argument and this is in her some listeners may be familiar with the children's book

1092
00:44:55,167 --> 00:45:01,311
If You Give a Mouse a Cookie and it's just a never-ending list of things that the mouse will want and so basically this is sort of what Apple

1093
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:05,151
Who argued if they said look if we Apple agree to what the government wants

1094
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:11,551
Today if you want us to break our own security and get into this iPhone that was owned by or used by you know now

1095
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:17,951
Now dead terrorist in San Bernardino tomorrow you can ask us to turn everybody's iPhones into tracking devices or you could ask Amazon

1096
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:24,351
How to turn into Lexus intuitive snooping devices in everyone's home we write you know and on and on and on and on we don't yet have the answer to

1097
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:30,239
Do the legal question as to whether or not the government does have the authority to order companies to do their bidding

1098
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,519
It's not clear yet

1099
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:35,871
How far the government can go and with the prevalence of all of these kinds

1100
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,407
End of devices that people have

1101
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,711
Voluntarily brought into their homes

1102
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,783
If you are an ambitious FBI agents or local

1103
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,807
Police officer

1104
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:47,391
It's easy to understand I think how those types of devices

1105
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,183
Could be useful to law enforce

1106
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:55,583
You know I don't know about where you live in Austin but here in Oakland where I live I have many neighbors that have you know surveillance video camera

1107
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,983
Outside their homes that are pointed literally at my own driveway and also for the public Street and I know of

1108
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:08,383
Another neighborhoods here in Oakland up instances where local neighborhood groups have voluntarily handed that information

1109
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,919
Over to police to bust

1110
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,479
Robbery suspects or things like that burglary

1111
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,783
Chica understand how that would be useful

1112
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,319
But at the same time it's

1113
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,135
Very different when a company is being forced

1114
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:24,511
To hand that over and it seems to me that we're rapidly entering a world if we're not there already

1115
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,583
Where those types of requests those types of court orders

1116
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,655
Are going to become you no more the rule rather than the exception

1117
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,215
What kind of precautions do you think

1118
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,495
Companies

1119
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,335
Need to have in place as they start putting these devices

1120
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:45,503
Yeah that's a good question you know so I think there's this phrase that many people may be familiar with known as privacy by Design

1121
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:51,903
And that doesn't just mean how do you design the actual product of what kind of data does it collect but also a few steps.

1122
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:58,303
Down the road once your products are out in the world what happens when your local police department calls up with ring or a

1123
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,839
Any other company and says hey

1124
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863
You know we think that

1125
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,959
The data from this device would be helpful in our investigation

1126
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,007
And you know I think all of us want

1127
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
The police

1128
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,335
To do their job so I would say if

1129
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
Accompany

1130
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:17,503
Not to pick on ring in particular but you know what, do you like that that is selling a product that collects you don't visual data audio data on

1131
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,271
All kinds of other things

1132
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:22,879
If they don't already have a policy in place as to under what conditions they will

1133
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:25,439
Comply with the government and also it's important

1134
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:31,839
To remember you know are they going to notify the customer who has generated or who is associated with that pitch

1135
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,631
Particular device for that particular account

1136
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:40,031
So I would suggest two companies that they really need to think long and hard as to what kinds of information they are collecting

1137
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:46,175
And what they're going to do when the day comes that a government entity wants access to that data

1138
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:52,319
So just to pick a technology that I know we're thinking a lot about and has a lot of surveillance capabilities

1139
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,343
What do you think about

1140
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,111
Drones

1141
00:47:55,647 --> 00:48:00,255
Drones are a technology that I think a very very interesting but also

1142
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,815
Very problematic in some ways

1143
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:06,399
Elegant we have to distinguish between the actions of

1144
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,799
Private persons are regular individuals like you and me and the actions of the government right because drones are so cheap lawn

1145
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,359
Enforcement that traditionally could not afford

1146
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
Sade have

1147
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,199
A fleet of aircraft or helicopters are even one

1148
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:22,527
Can now afford not only a drone but perhaps most

1149
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:28,415
So if you run a Google News search for police acquires drones you'd be surprised

1150
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:33,023
It practically every week somewhere in America you know some County Sheriff for some town

1151
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:39,423
Is now you know buying or expanding its drone Fleet and in many instances those towns or counties

1152
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,191
We're cities

1153
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:46,591
Don't always have clear policies as to again and what circumstances they can deploy the drones in what circumstances they don't deploy

1154
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:52,991
Play them what happens to the data that is collected what happens to the videos with the photos that are collected are they allowed to mount

1155
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:59,391
Extra devices on to the Drone such as an infrared camera or other kinds of things are they allowed to loan it out

1156
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:05,791
Two other agencies so a lot of us I think we're just generally unaware as to what kind of surveillance technology our local

1157
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,071
Law enforcement have

1158
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:11,167
And if you don't know I would encourage anybody to file a public records request

1159
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:17,567
You don't have to be a lawyer or journalist to do this every state has public records laws and you can you know send an email or a letter

1160
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:23,967
We're to your county sheriff or your Police Department and ask them for a contract purchase records things like that policies regarding

1161
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
Drones or anything else

1162
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,831
Okay so it feels ambitious is a person who

1163
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:35,231
Likes having the convenience and even a little bit of safety associated with some of these devices like I love my smart speaker

1164
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,535
I don't want to give it up I actually left my doorbell cam

1165
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:43,935
But how can I take my love of Technology my understanding of technology and apply it towards better

1166
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,007
Why so the government doesn't use this kind of stuff

1167
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:47,775
Against me

1168
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,799
It feels pretty daunting

1169
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:55,199
It is daunting you're right the first thing is to you know check the Privacy policies that none of us read

1170
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:58,271
Yeah we don't read all the time if you have let's say

1171
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,831
A smart doorbell or a smartphone

1172
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,879
Security camera or whatever the case may be

1173
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:06,463
Go actually read the policy that the company had laid out

1174
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:12,351
If it's done by a reputable company chances are very good that they will have one of these policies up on their website

1175
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:18,751
And go actually read it if you don't want to read every word just search for it phrases like law enforcement or subpoena or Warren

1176
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,543
Or things like that and see

1177
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:24,383
If the terms that they have laid out in that document comport with what you think

1178
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,687
Is fair and reasonable for the company to

1179
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:30,015
To do you know and also I would say if you are

1180
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:33,087
Again whether you're a reporter and attorney and activist

1181
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:37,183
Just a regular you know citizen ask your local law enforcement agency

1182
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:43,583
How many times they have you know tried to get at somebody is Alexa data or something like that file record

1183
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,607
Request ask

1184
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:48,191
Because I sensibly these agencies are supposed to be accountable to us

1185
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:54,591
And it's hard for reporters like you and me to find out and we rely on individuals to come forward and

1186
00:50:54,847 --> 00:51:00,991
And tell us you know hey this thing happened to me or I found out that my County Sheriff was doing X Y and Z and I'm really worried about that

1187
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:07,391
That so I would say you know asked around and if you don't think that you're in a good position to tell the world then you know

1188
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:12,511
No contact me or you or any other reporter that you think would be receptive to that type of information

1189
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:17,375
All right well service thank you so much for coming on the show today I really appreciate it

1190
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,399
My pleasure

1191
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,703
That's it for this week

1192
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:27,103
