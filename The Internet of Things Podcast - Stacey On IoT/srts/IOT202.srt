35
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
And

36
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,984
We're going to hear from a new Advertiser this week called urbanex

37
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,544
+ Denise Howell Whois

38
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,896
An attorney in Newport Beach California came on the show to talk about

39
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,688
All the crazy

40
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,736
Ramifications of having connect

41
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272

Proceedings

45
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,904
You're going to hear this and understand what rights do you have in

46
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
Most likely what rights do

47
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
You don't have

48
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
So let's get

49
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
To it

50
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792

Turn devices to systems and solutions

60
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,368
Our end-to-end infrastructure creates the right conditions for data

61
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904

63
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
Dot-com

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
That's data

65
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
Makes possible.com

66
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
Okay

67
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
Hey Kevin

68
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,448
Before we get started on the show I should tell everybody

69
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
I've had a couple

70
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
Emails lately at people trying to

71
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,592
Play or show on their Google assistants or the

72
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
Echo device

73
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
The reason you can't get it

74
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,968
Because we are actually the internet

75
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
Of things podcast

76
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
So if

77
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,368
If you would like to hear it you just have to say Madam a play The Internet of Things podcast

78
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
And I will a

79
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
China what's the step

80
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
Okay

81
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Let's talk about

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
Lowe's

83
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Shut

84
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Sing Down

85
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,632
Kevin this makes me so sad I remember all the way back in the

86
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Mike 2012

87
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,496
Getting excited about Lowe's Iris and getting my own and

88
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
Setting it up and being

89
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Kind of missed

90
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,872
Because it had a subscription fee to do a lot of the really cool stuff

91
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,432
This was in the era of Staples connect

92
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,248
And SmartThings launching

93
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
And

94
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,320
I can't remember if wink was on the scene yet or not

95
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,904
The good news is there's no subscription fee anymore

96
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
Cast

97
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,208
There's no Iris

98
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
So

99
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,304
At the end of last year they said that they were looking for a buyer

100
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,352
The time I really doubted that they

101
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
They could find one

102
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,656
Because it's a weird platformer

103
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,704
You'd have to support all the users

104
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,264
It's a dedicated system so it's not

105
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
It didn't seem like something

106
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,104
Anyone else would be excited

107
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
Basically

108
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Right

109
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,712
Got to be a challenge to make money if you're a buyer of this

110
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
Do you know

111
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:39,136
Like you said support people turn a profit and so on so forth and yeah it's not like we didn't know this was coming cuz you

112
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:45,536
And we sat on the show couple months ago they're looking for a buyer we got a lot of questions about Lowe's Iris you always it's

113
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,584
Still going to be viable and so on and so forth

114
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
At this point

115
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,704
March 31st it is shutting down the platform

116
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
But

117
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,776
We see this happen all the time

118
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,848
Probably less now as the market is maturing

119
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:04,480
But this is probably the best possible way something like this could shut down for its customers because

120
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
Cause

121
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,832
People can continue to use the service through March 31st

122
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
You're not going to be charged

123
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
After

124
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,791
January 31st can I still get like two free months and you never prorated refunds actually going out to come

125
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
Customer switch

126
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
I'm very surprised by

127
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
Yeah you're going to get

128
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
If you're registered Iris

129
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
You'll get this email and if you

130
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,031
Click through in the link to the email you can actually

131
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,335
Register for a prepaid Visa card

132
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
So

133
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
You're going to get a Visa card

134
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
4 in

135
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:39,551
I guess in one of the Articles someone who had Iris said that they got about a hundred bucks for their Hub and 140 for their feet

136
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Video camera

137
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
Which was about what he paid for it

138
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
Damso

139
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
That's

140
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,255
Has been shut down school it's a pretty rapid shutdown usually you

141
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,815
Get a little longer lead-time sometimes

142
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
You don't get rebates

143
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,631
Remember when Nest bought

144
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
Resolved and they were just like

145
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
We're going to shut this down in 6

146
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,775
Whatever was like what I paid $300 for this thing

147
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,311
And then finally nested

148
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
Come back and offer some rebates

149
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
So

150
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Sad

151
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,455
It's doing well by its users by doing this

152
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,503
It's a bigger picture

153
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
Let's talk about what this means for the Smart Home

154
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,855
Because while Lowe's is doing this

155
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
Ikea is actually

156
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
Doubling down

157
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
With more products

158
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
Text and their CEO

159
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,023
Getting up on stage and talking about

160
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
Like launching have a kitchen as a service worker

161
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
Going to have you know

162
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
Furniture as a service

163
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
In this kind of

164
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
Rent not to own just

165
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
Rent to rent

166
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
Concept in

167
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,311
Products because of the connectivity

168
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
Being able to enable it so

169
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
I find it interesting that Lowe's is like

170
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
No

171
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
Ikea's like

172
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Yeah

173
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
I'm surprised that

174
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:46,623
Ikea in a sentence going after this space but they are different from those because

175
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
They are selling

176
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Furniture

177
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,487
They are selling the insides of your home where is

178
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Louis

179
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
Who sells the components for the inside of your home building materials and so on yes they do sell appliances and other things but

180
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,983
It is a different type of store so I see this as a better

181
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,079
It for Ikea I'm not saying they're going to be successful I certainly hope AR

182
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
But

183
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:13,247
I mean based on the data that they have it must assume make it be successful here and I could see why they may think that we'll have to see

184
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
If that's actual reality though

185
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
Yes and I will also say I talked to some of the people who participated in those Iris over the years

186
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
In one of the complaints they had was

187
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,023
The companies would

188
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,423
Add connectivity to their products for the Lowe's Iris system but they wouldn't do it in a thoughtful way and what happened was they were

189
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
Doing it primarily to get

190
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
Promotion at Lowe's

191
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
The Branding so

192
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,871
Customers didn't always have an awesome experience or sometimes

193
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,919
Connectivity didn't enable anything that

194
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
Made sense

195
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
That's important

196
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
So

197
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
It is

198
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
We'll see

199
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
Yeah I still go to

200
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,159
You know my Hardware I was at Lowe's the other day about anymore

201
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
So

202
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:59,327
Yeah they'll continue to sell smart home devices it's just you know the iris

203
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:05,727
Brand and service is going away if you do want to get that Redemption don't go to your store for that it's all done

204
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,823
Online however Lowe's does say in the letter that they sent out to people

205
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,175
That you can return any Irish items purchased within the last 90 days

206
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:19,551
That are not connected to the Irish platform via the normal return policy so you may be able to get

207
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,087
Money back that way as well

208
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,927
Happy thought by this now and then maybe later I'll put it on the platform

209
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
Alright so

210
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
Said who's there

211
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
But maybe not unexpected

212
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
This feels like

213
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,935
As the markets mature and we're seeing a closing down of kind of the early days and speaking of that

214
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Took a bunch of

215
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
So let's start with lifx

216
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,335
Lifx was just acquired

217
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
Bye buddy home

218
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
Which is based in Australia

219
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
Lifx was actually

220
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
Create an in Australia

221
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
We have the founders on the podcast like

222
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
2014 or so

223
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
Crazy thing

224
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
And

225
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
Ghetto

226
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,415
Typical thing on a colored light bulbs

227
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,975
Come along way they did a deal with Qualcomm

228
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Licensing IP thing

229
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
Free wifi

230
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,815
Chips for light bulbs basic

231
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
And now

232
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
About my buddy

233
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
Which is an iot platform in Australia that does energy monitoring and management which is not something I

234
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
I actually associate

235
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
Lifx at all

236
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:19,967
And neither do I and that's the funny thing the intent is to use the lifx products to gain more

237
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
Energy monitoring data

238
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
But

239
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
Did you have to buy lifx for that kind of

240
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,879
Scratch my head over that

241
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
This may be a four stack

242
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Position

243
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
I mean

244
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
If you look at where we are in the bar

245
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
Market we're seeing a lot of companies there like oh it's time

246
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
You got to reach scale

247
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
True

248
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
True

249
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
So

250
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,215
The purchase price is 51 million

251
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
Dollars

252
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,311
I feel like lifx probably if they were

253
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,151
Amazing what do better than that but they actually are the number two

254
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,431
Tender in the

255
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,063
Is it the colored smart light bulbs space in smart bulbs that's what they say behind

256
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,879
Philips which is no longer really Phillips

257
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
What is Philips Hue but

258
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,743
Company that actually owns the Philips hue light bulbs is

259
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Childe signify

260
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
Just in case you guys were

261
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Not confused

262
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,143
So now do we know if we're going to see

263
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:14,239
You know life X products continuing to be for sale here in the states

264
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
I would expect so

265
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
Even though nobody is

266
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
Mainly in Australia

267
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
Base platform

268
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,735
I mean I think that would be kind of silly to spend turkey 1 million and then

269
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,271
Really limit your sales

270
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,831
I haven't really said but

271
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
I

272
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,183
Can imagine that lifx goes away from everywhere but Australia

273
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
Wechat another acquisition

274
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
And things will go away

275
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Wig wag

276
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Which

277
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
Is a sensor company based in Austin

278
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:45,983
They started out making a very generic sensor and then pivoted to making an industrial

279
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,335
Or an Enterprise iot platform they have been acquired by our

280
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
The chip design firm

281
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
This looks like

282
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
A straight-up

283
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:59,295
It feels like cuz arm has such a big presence in Austin it feels like somebody's friend was like yeah sure

284
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
I'm sure they're slicks

285
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,647
Already happening here but wigwag

286
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
Their platform

287
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,975
Will be closing on May

288
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
6

289
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
2019

290
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,583
And arm did send some refunds to

291
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
To the backers

292
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Wig wag

293
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Kickstarter

294
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Wayback

295
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
So

296
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
I miss that Kickstarter

297
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,055
You did so I remember really well be

298
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
Because we were

299
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
Oh man we were in the middle of a cloud

300
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
Prince in when they launched

301
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
There

302
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
Kickstarter it was

303
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,295
Awesome it was like this generic sensor that was going to do

304
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,343
Everything and I mean

305
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
I wanted it

306
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,159
Like right then and there and it wasn't like

307
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,695
2013 that have

308
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,023
It was the sort of thing that I guess when we thought the

309
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
Home automation Market

310
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,351
Would be more creative and fun

311
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
You could actually like

312
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,191
Create all these cool rules and I thought people would want to buy

313
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
It was

314
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
It had humidity vibration

315
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,567
Temperature all the stuff and I

316
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
I thought you know it's a great thing that you

317
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,919
Put a lock on your washing machine when it stopped moving

318
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
It'd be like oh you're watching stunts

319
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
It was basically

320
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,087
And then later on they pivoted to be more enterprise-focused

321
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,903
And critic 8-way device and then sensors there but

322
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
So goodbye

323
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Wee bag

324
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,583
Hopefully arm is taking maybe some of your interface I don't know really

325
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
What are there getting you

326
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Maybe it's okay

327
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
There was no

328
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
Pricing associate

329
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
Okay

330
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,519
And then finally

331
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
Control4 which is a

332
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
Professional home automation

333
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Can system

334
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
Everly Candles Company

335
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,687
Yes Charlie Candles there is

336
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
His company but

337
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Head of

338
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
Amazon smart home stuff

339
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,599
Castform anime

340
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
She went over there last year

341
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
So they bought a company called Neo

342
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
Animatrix

343
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Nothing

344
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Device that

345
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
Control your television

346
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Controlled

347
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,447
Your lace it worked and it was a really beautiful life

348
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
Ticket launch to the city of

349
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
Maybe it was CES I've seen it for the last

350
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
A couple years ago

351
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Those shows

352
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
In

353
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,431
It's fancy it's nice it's pretty I mean it's kind of like a

354
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,503
Display on it and very simple buttons

355
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
Tapped into their database of like a gazillion product

356
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,367
60000 devices

357
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
Yeah

358
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
And basically when I talked to Charlie briefly about

359
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
Bastille this is

360
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
Their whole thing is at

361
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
At the Smart Home is too complex for

362
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,375
DIY hours most people are not going to want to

363
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Integrate all this

364
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,191
Weather so they're trying to bring in

365
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,239
Pieces that they think are attractive

366
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
And useful and easy-to-use so

367
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
Their dealer Network

368
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,895
Can come in and do it for people and then people still have

369
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
Like more options to

370
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,967
. so that's

371
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,271
Video hear you book The interesting thing

372
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,575
Current Neo customers they're going to get support

373
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
For all services

374
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,415
For another 24 months

375
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
They're not going to sell the Neo anymore

376
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
2

377
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,911
They're not buying it for the remote with Avaya I guess for the smarts the SDK the database

378
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
Okay so

379
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
All of these acquisitions

380
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:05,407
Big picture you guys we talked about this we've talked about this for the last year-and-a-half

381
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,503
There are a lot of iot platform place I got funded in 2013

382
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
2014

383
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
They're all going away

384
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
They couldn't

385
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
Reach scale

386
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
And bus

387
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,023
Yeah I'm getting some soon I mean it's not like they had bad technology cetera but

388
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,071
They can't do it alone obviously

389
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Right

390
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
And I mean that's not surprising

391
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:30,751
A lot of these companies got a lot of their money and started right after Google paid 3 point

392
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,799
2 billion dollars for nest

393
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
Crazy rate in everyone's like

394
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
Oh my God I got to get it

395
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Smart Homes

396
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
End

397
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,479
That was the high right there

398
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,831
And it was way high I still don't think it was the best

399
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
Purchase price value

400
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
But you know

401
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,791
Nest is still around still doing well they're integrating it better into things

402
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
I think they're making

403
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,607
Lemonade out of their lives

404
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
Okay let's talk about

405
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
Let's talk about privacy in

406
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
Data security and all that

407
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Get stuffed

408
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
That we love so much

409
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:10,175
Here at the show this weekend the New York Times did an article on

410
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Send

411
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
And

412
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,039
Practice of doing these Longview Les and you basically say

413
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,063
Yeah yeah I agree

414
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
And thinking NASA

415
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,671
Reasonable way to do a contract between a user in

416
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Adidas

417
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,839
And they're longer than I thought I always thought that you was were long but it was interesting to see you right in the beginning of the story

418
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:32,703
Reading Amazon's terms and conditions alone out loud takes approximately 9 hours

419
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
Yes

420
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Yeah what's up

421
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
Yes

422
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
Maybe if you read it

423
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,151
To yourself it takes less but it is a long time and I'll tell you I read

424
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,991
Read all of these like a whole day's worth of effort

425
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Yeah

426
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
In

427
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
It mean when you read them

428
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
You're also

429
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
There's only one option

430
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
You click yes if you want to use it

431
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
If you have to

432
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
Suzuki

433
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Close to you

434
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
So

435
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
It feels like

436
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
It is like

437
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,607
It is a very uneven Exchange

438
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
Especially

439
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
In my opinion

440
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
I already paid you money

441
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
To buy this device

442
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
And the functionality

443
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,639
And you're paying that money before you even know what the terms of service are

444
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,735
So there's been some ideas here we talk to people in the show who

445
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,551
Suggested like when you put a device in your Amazon cart

446
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
You get a

447
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
Little

448
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
How to play

449
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
Do you know Apple or Google does with their

450
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
Permissions when you download an app

451
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
You can something like that

452
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,303
It says this shares data with 3rd power

453
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
You consent to that

454
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
And then you have to read those

455
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
Before you can actually

456
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
Buy the product

457
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Which I think is

458
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
Not a bad idea

459
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
It's a very good start

460
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
I don't know if we're ever going

461
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
See that but

462
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
So that's one way to do that

463
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
So the New York Times essay

464
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,503
I bring this up because this is something we've talked

465
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,855
Talked about for like two or three years we we've talked about the lack of any meaningful

466
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
Concentra

467
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,647
Can you sign these things

468
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
And the lack of recourse for

469
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,511
Consumers when they realize what they've given up

470
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,583
You can always bring things back without paying lyca restocking

471
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
Eeyore

472
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
You know

473
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
Sometimes you just

474
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
Can bring it back at all and

475
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
That feels unfair

476
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:13,055
And I'm glad the New York Times has talked about this cuz the New York Times is

477
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,127
As it were the paper of record so when they start talking about things

478
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
Things actually happen

479
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
Which

480
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
I wish we had that power Kevin

481
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:26,111
We do not but they did point out some of the things we have talked about before obviously gdpr

482
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Over in

483
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,951
The Hue enemy California

484
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
Law

485
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
Yes

486
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
This is definitely something that

487
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
People are thinking more about with

488
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
The Wider ass face

489
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
Books candles

490
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,959
Some of the Privacy conversations with apples trying to bring up and of course

491
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
CPR

492
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
So the solution here

493
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,079
I don't know there's efforts by

494
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,407
I told you about that particular idea about looking at data

495
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Before

496
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:56,063
You put something in your cart there's also public knowledge released a paper last week about creating assets

497
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Security Shield

498
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,903
This is more about security and not as much about privacy

499
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,231
But the idea is there encouraging the government to

500
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
Create a program call

501
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,559
Call the security Shield that is kind of like

502
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
The epa's

503
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Energy star

504
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,703
And so if you're not familiar with that the energy star program

505
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
Is federally there's a law written

506
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,311
It talks about what standards things need to meet

507
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Achieve this stick

508
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Basically

509
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
And

510
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
Public knowledge is power

511
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,759
Paper is all about how to create such a program for iot device secure

512
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,063
So that would be useful right

513
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
Absolutely

514
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
So yes

515
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Maybe that way

516
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
Will happen I'm sure.

517
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
Let's talk about

518
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
Let's talk about another security

519
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,839
Challenge this is actually in the EU

520
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:45,983
How much GDP are so there is a recall of children's smart watches that are leaking location data which

521
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
Nobody wants

522
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Now this is the safe

523
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,919
Kid one made by a German company called Enochs group

524
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,759
It is not for sale in the UK or the us but

525
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
Apparently in Iceland

526
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,135
They found out that the mobile app

527
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671
That works with the watch

528
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:11,071
Has unencrypted Communications to the server so there is unauthenticated access to the data so you can get

529
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:16,191
My location history of a child wearing a Swatch phone number serial number Etc

530
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
Yeah so it was basically I think they call it a wrap it alert as part of the rules and laws over there too

531
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,407
Recall this thing and that's exactly what's happening

532
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
It's pretty power

533
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,479
Forcing a product recall is

534
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
That's not a thing to be taken

535
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
Yeah I totally agree

536
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:36,415
I don't want to see this is overkill this is okay this is a problem that needs to be resolved but even if

537
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
It's just the mobile app that

538
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,559
Has the unencrypted data why couldn't they just put an app update out that

539
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
Encrypted data

540
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,935
Probably because they couldn't Insure One because it's the EU

541
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,495
But to maybe they couldn't insure people

542
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
Downloaded the patch

543
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:56,639
Maybe the watch was too small that Hardware on the inside was too small to like

544
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
Take the patch and then

545
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,967
Reboot I don't know

546
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,367
From a technical standpoint if it's connecting to a back-end server and it's the data go into that server they could shut the service off until people

547
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
Updated

548
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,463
Not the watch that it's updated Sac City app

549
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,327
According to this story so it may be just a send a message I don't know like we're not going to

550
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
Tolerate this kind of

551
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,423
We're Not Gonna Take It

552
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
No

553
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
Oh I'm singing it must be a good day

554
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
Speaking of encryption

555
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,639
And let's take a moment to say here's the basic rule you should encrypt

556
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Your data on your servers

557
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
You should encrypt your data

558
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Find the app

559
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
And you should encrypt

560
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
The data on the device

561
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
And then

562
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,623
Whenever that data is

563
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Traveling

564
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
Play the app and then

565
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
Device between

566
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Cloud

567
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
The phone in the cloud

568
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
You should also encrypt

569
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,375
There that should just be the way it is in yes encryption is a

570
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,447
Pain there's a little bit of overhead there some costs associated with

571
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
But if you want to secure iot

572
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
It's not Job 1

573
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,823
Not having hard-coded password

574
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,871
Unsurprisingly child

575
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
But

576
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,479
Sparkle table Stakes it still tablesteaks absolutely

577
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
So

578
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
This reason

579
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
To a report about

580
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,111
Unlocking encryption on some popular iot devices

581
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:16,511
Yeah this is a test data from researchers at Brazil's Federal University of

582
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
Pernambuco which I may have

583
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
Totally

584
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,423
That up but that's okay and University of Michigan which I got that right

585
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,471
They took it.

586
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
The Wolverines

587
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
Alcohol during sex

588
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
Tom Brady

589
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Whatever

590
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,967
The report took a look at 32 smartphone apps used to configure

591
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,015
Incontrol 96 Audi

592
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,111
Top selling WiFi Bluetooth devices sold on Amazon so that's a pretty good

593
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
Testbed async

594
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,415
Unfortunately

595
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,439
Lee found out

596
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,511
31% of the apps have no encryption at all

597
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,863
And another 19% had hard-coded encryption keys so you could

598
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,751
Perhaps reverse-engineer the encryption bad bad bad

599
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,079
Kind of jumped out of me because of the companies and products named here

600
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
They

601
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,431
Created some proof-of-concept attacks based on their findings

602
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,991
Anime basically break

603
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
To hack around with

604
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Tp-link

605
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
The lifx app

606
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,672
Belkin WeMo and broadlink e-control app

607
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:23,072
So granted a lot of these tax you have to be on the same Wi-Fi network and so on that's kind of a given

608
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,864
In cases but that doesn't make it

609
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,424
Acceptable so well

610
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
They also shared that

611
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
Tp-link

612
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:34,336
They have the same hard-coded encryption key for all of the devices of a given product

613
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:40,736
Yeah yeah they even showed the code I mean I can see the Java code and I actually can understand it thanks my Java class

614
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,064
I have the seating number for the hashing and encryption and

615
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
I could

616
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:50,720
Probably figure out what the encryption key is based on that but actually so could probably anybody was the time at 4

617
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,024
Yeah and Kevin hasn't spent that much time and effort

618
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
So

619
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,120
Not on that note this is not yet

620
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,960
So this is not that hard so what is this mean for you guys

621
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,984
People who have these

622
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Cuz I have to pee

623
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,568
Dlink switches in my house I have WeMo

624
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,592
Are you stopping

625
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Actually

626
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,432
This month we're giving away a WeMo dimmer switch

627
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,736
Encryption not included

628
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,040
So in some cases it's a design

629
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
So WeMo doesn't

630
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:23,232
Encryption they don't do encryption between the device in the app is part of making it easier for users

631
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
They say

632
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
Now I know

633
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
One of their former

634
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
Security folks

635
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
The leftover

636
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
For this so this is something that

637
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,216
Did they've chosen to do even though they know

638
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
So

639
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
You might say okay

640
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,336
We talked about risk profiles and

641
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:44,736
Previous podcast but you might say hey do I have a high enough risk profile that I should really worried about this or are the devices that are

642
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
Into these Outlets

643
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
Could I really cause

644
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
Problems

645
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
You know what is it

646
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,136
Is an air purifier or is it a

647
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
Curling iron

648
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Thermostat

649
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,304
I mean I don't know why you wouldn't talk it in obviously but I'm just thinking

650
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,424
Portable heater

651
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,776
So you don't think about what you got plugged into these device

652
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
Two might want to hack

653
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
How easy it is

654
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,640
Getting on your Wi-Fi network is not

655
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
Super trivial unless you

656
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
And out your

657
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,992
Wi-Fi network like candy

658
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,016
Which some people do

659
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,320
I always recommend guest Network for everybody

660
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,856
Especially your kids friend

661
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
Man today is chock-full of

662
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Security tips for

663
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,232
Yeah I would also recommend

664
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,536
Choosing devices Worthy

665
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,608
Apps have two-factor Authentication

666
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,888
To log into those app

667
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,704
That way people cannot log into an app

668
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
As you

669
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,752
Easley anyway

670
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,824
And control your devices if they were to gain access to mosto

671
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,152
Yeah for example if I was on Kevin's Wi-Fi network

672
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
Etihad WeMo devices

673
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,504
Because I have WeMo devices in my house and I'm running the Apple

674
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:54,368
I just open my WeMo app in his house if I'm on his Network and start controlling

675
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
His devices

676
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
Yeah I'll be back

677
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
And we Moto's

678
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,512
That's not a choice if I understand

679
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,584
7 on the flip side the report did it's not all doom and gloom

680
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,472
Reported point out that Google's Nest thermostat app is a good example of how to do security right

681
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:15,872
Which I know that also supports two-factor authentication and all the configuration is secure with SLT

682
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,200
Last of the cloud or via Wi-Fi with wpso

683
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,528
There are right ways to do that are examples of this

684
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,136
Kind of should be a standard but that's a whole another issue that we sort of touched upon earlier

685
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:32,768
Yeah in Google I will say Google does a lot of stuff behind the scenes on the security

686
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,584
Not allowed to talk about some of the things I hate

687
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
I do but they're very good

688
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
The Nest devices are

689
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Are very good

690
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,496
So very comfortable when they see flaws or when

691
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,520
People bring things up

692
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
They actually took

693
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Communicate with

694
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:50,432
Users they update tp-link has had a couple hacks and they have not updated a lot of stuff

695
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
So they're cheap though

696
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
And that's what

697
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
People seem to be buying

698
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,808
So it's not the downside of

699
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,416
This is that security does cost money and it costs convenience and

700
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
People

701
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:06,048
I don't know I don't actually have to factor enabled on my Nest even though I think it's a great thing to have

702
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,632
Know any chance I can't I do and then I have a

703
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,680
Google Titan security key for

704
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:17,568
All those accounts you can use a benefit Decatur app there's lots of ways. You can use SMS messaging

705
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,408
Would be my least favorite option at that's not as secure as other options

706
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,224
Alright will see you now we know that I am terrible at

707
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,272
And I wish that the MyQ

708
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,808
The Chamberlain MyQ also

709
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
So has 2Pac

710
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,648
Application which this is the year of us calling

711
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
42 Factor

712
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
On all iot device

713
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
So get used to it

714
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:40,864
You're not using it maybe I should come to your house and try and control your nest

715
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
Read on that

716
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
Okay

717
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,216
Speaking of Google

718
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,264
We got some news on assistant

719
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
Google Assistant

720
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
Chanel

721
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Figure into

722
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,408
Interpreter which announced at CES

723
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
I was super excited about it

724
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:59,552
And then I had like right when I got home from CVS I had a foreign exchange student my house from Spain

725
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,088
We totally could have used it

726
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
But it wasn't out yet

727
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,416
So what

728
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,768
Yeah there's always at the CES demo that Google gave and it works

729
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:15,168
Flawlessly in that demo and it wasn't kander staged it was just a regular Google home device and they had a

730
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,728
Conversation in English and French

731
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:24,128
Because obviously multiple languages but they showed it off it was cool it's one of those cool features that are unfortunate I'll never use

732
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:30,272
Cuz I don't really have foreign exchange students here but it is rolling out now so if you have need of it

733
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
You should see it

734
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,600
Anytime soon I would say

735
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
And what do you say

736
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,440
If you want to have a conversation in a language essay Spanish

737
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
Do you say be my Spanish interpreter or

738
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,376
Help me speak Spanish and it becomes a basically it is almost a port of the Google translate mobile app

739
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
Right on

740
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:50,496
We have a smart home display it'll show with both sides of the conversation

741
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,312
In the two languages so you can read it as well as hear it

742
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,104
But if you don't it would just

743
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
If you have a Google home

744
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
You just hear the translation

745
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
See it but

746
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,736
I can't seem to work very well

747
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,040
Yay and I actually

748
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
So

749
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,344
Not in person

750
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392
But in communicating via

751
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
Email in

752
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
Text with

753
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
B

754
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
Parents of Exchange

755
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Didn't I would actually

756
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,536
Translate function on

757
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
Google assist

758
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
Can I be like

759
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,888
I typed my thing in English no translated to Spanish.

760
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,728
And apparently they got the gist so we're good

761
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:25,568
He didn't use those Google pixel buds so you can probably return those things

762
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
II

763
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,432
Yeah those are those really Nifty

764
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,712
At least in theory

765
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:38,112
Headphones that you would connect to your phone and it would use the Google Translate app kind of been real time so you can hear the Translate

766
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,416
Someone but didn't seem to work very well

767
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,464
At the headsets they were.

768
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,256
Other Google News

769
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,328
Making life a little easier now you can get

770
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,632
Google assistant on your nest guard

771
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:55,520
And if you're like what is my Nest guard it is part of the nest security system it is bbrainz of that it's a little

772
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544
Thing that you

773
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
I can wave your tag over to

774
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
Turn your alarm on and off

775
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,432
Basically now you can ask it things like oh

776
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,480
Haji do I need an umbrella today

777
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,016
And it will

778
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
It will help you

779
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:12,160
Yeah this is rather sneaky because I don't know that everybody knew there was a microphone in

780
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,952
Yashow it's an option

781
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,256
Temperature and it's often because

782
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,816
NASCAR does have an on device microphone

783
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
If you've got one

784
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,168
It's not enabled by default

785
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
So that's why you've got to opt-in

786
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,288
But it's not an always listening device if you don't want it to be

787
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,360
What I would love and I don't know if it works this way but

788
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,408
Because you're doing this as you rush out the

789
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,992
The door it would be awesome to set reminders for your nest guard

790
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
To be like

791
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,832
Do you have your gym clothes it's Thursday right

792
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,136
Or whatever is like reminders you need

793
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
As you walk out

794
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
Cuz I'm always walking out the door

795
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
Thanks right so

796
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
When you

797
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
Swipe that tag

798
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
And it knows you're there

799
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,608
Be awesome if it just shout it out

800
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
Proactively

801
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,680
Don't forget your gym clothes

802
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,728
Yeah I don't think it does that

803
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:04,128
Which it would be really cool I wonder if there's a routine available for that or someone which one

804
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,920
Pulling up well and maybe

805
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
I mean it software

806
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
We can always make it better

807
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,760
Yep so

808
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,040
Instead of just always ask

809
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,832
Asking I'd have it proactively remind me

810
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Me about things that aren't pork

811
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,160
Cool alright

812
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
So that

813
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
Doesn't quite

814
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
Make for the

815
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,304
It's a very expensive security system but it might be worth it eventually

816
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,168
That is it for the new section of the show let's go to the iot podcast

817
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
Hotline

818
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,240
We got a winner to announce and

819
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,520
We have a question

820
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,288
About Viper

821
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:36,896
This week the iot podcast hotline is sponsored by a pharaoh

822
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,200
What's the fifth largest iot patent

823
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,480
Hopefully on the world

824
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,808
Afero provides a proven iot platform that doesn't risk

825
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
Ask your brand

826
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
Apparel customers have experienced as much

827
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,928
Percent reduction in time to Market

828
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
Nginx higher activation rate

829
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,024
Learn more at a pharaoh.

830
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,096

That needs to happen before the end of February

846
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,376
It's a short

847
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,168
So February 28th at

848
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,704
Midnight Eastern

849
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
Colace

850
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
And poof

851
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,032
It's Magic here in

852
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,360
So let's go to this week's voice mail which is about

853
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,896
Light switches

854
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
Yay

855
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,200
Hey Stacy this is ad

856
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,224
From a little Kentucky

857
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,504
My iot question

858
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
Involves lighting

859
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
I have

860
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Currently have

861
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344
Plum lightpad

862
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
I was part of their Kickstarter

863
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,976
Purchase those seams if those are not viable any

864
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,512
At least what I can gather

865
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,560
To my internet search and

866
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,840
Not working as well there

867
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,608
The timing

868
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,912
Json outside lights actually is now

869
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
Working

870
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
Enough for me and some

871
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,776
Looking for a smart light switch to

872
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,800
Implement

873
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,080
In its place

874
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
I love the color ring around the

875
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
Plum lightpad

876
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,920
You know it's not a necessity

877
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
What's at the noon

878
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,992
Light switches as well but

879
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,040
Looking for other options out there maybe

880
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,832
CES 2019 will have to

881
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,880
On that front as well

882
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
Oanda

883
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,720
This is sad news this is another one of those companies that

884
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,512
We thought might get bought but didn't

885
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,792
Plum is

886
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,328
Actually in Austin company it was

887
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,376
Founded by the former head of Cydia

888
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,704
Way back in 2012 and idea was to make

889
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,496
An awesome light switch that controlled

890
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
Everything

891
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,800
I mean truly it was

892
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,848
Is way ahead of its time nose very pretty

893
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,128
But

894
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,664
They are no longer

895
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
It doesn't seem that they're operating

896
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,504
Anymore I have not gotten any emails back

897
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
Back from them

898
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,296
About my questions

899
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
Feels pretty grim

900
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,344
So

901
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
Plum light pads

902
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,464
They're actually ahead of their time but now we've got tons of options

903
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
Choose from

904
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,024
You mentioned energy monitor

905
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,840
And so that's throwing us for a little bit of a loop

906
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,144
Cuz the only energy monitoring light switch that we

907
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
Find an actual switch

908
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,728
Was a zigbee based 1/4

909
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
Mge

910
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
If energy monitoring is

911
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
Important to you

912
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,152
And that's probably what you should go with but then you've got hugs and all this other

913
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
But

914
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,504
You just want to really highly functional Advanced light

915
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,552
Then we got lots of options

916
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,904
You mentioned the noon those are cool because they do these pre-designed lighting things

917
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Very pretty

918
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
I would also make a plug

919
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,488
For brilliance

920
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,304
Those do a lot of home automation

921
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,144
Control and they don't have a pretty LED but you can put your own

922
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,168
Photos on there

923
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,240
And that's kind of neat if you like to see pictures of

924
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
Your family are

925
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:43,776
Your favorite

926
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
Vacation spot

927
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,640
Lightpad they do have timer functionalities alarms Electric

928
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,920
Control your Sonos your nests

929
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
All kinds of stuff

930
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,992
A little complicated to set up

931
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
I would recommend

932
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
Professional installer

933
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
And they're expensive

934
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
But

935
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
I do a lot

936
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,880
If your

937
00:32:59,392 --> 00:32:59,904
Less

938
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,696
Like your like that is too much

939
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
Idevices make

940
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,256
A dimmer switch

941
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,792
Or a on off switch

942
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,584
Switch usually you need to double-check

943
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
Which is which

944
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,984
It only works with iOS so only Apple but it is Wi-Fi so you don't need any sort of hubby

945
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Take things

946
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,336
And they have that led have an LED on the device that

947
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
Might be exciting

948
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,640
Or you can wait

949
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,712
Because you are entered to win our WeMo dimmer and you

950
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
You can see how you feel about that

951
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,272
Yeah we look

952
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,088
High and low for something very similar to

953
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
The plum

954
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:34,720
Which is unique because it has an LED light ring around the switch so Shore minutes

955
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:39,328
In the dark it's really easy to find but nobody else has done that that we could see

956
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:43,424
There plenty of switches had like a little LED indicator making LED strip

957
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,216
But nothing around the entire

958
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,776
Paddle switch itself unfortunately

959
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,056
But there are lots

960
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,592
Lots of light switches so if you want to

961
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,384
Like I said brilliant switch

962
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,408
I just read about a company

963
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,504
Oreo Oreo switch looks really interesting I haven't tested it out

964
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
It feels like something

965
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
Do you want to test

966
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:03,136
That's all about like wellness and circadian rhythms and dimming lights in

967
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,184
Automation actually automatic car

968
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,488
Libation where it learns about the sensors in that one

969
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
Tons of sensors in there

970
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,816
It doesn't do the energy monitoring

971
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
So

972
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
I hate to

973
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,912
That leaving you empty-handed I'm almost leaving you with

974
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
Too many things

975
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,240
But maybe you can call us back and

976
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,520
Let us know what your most

977
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,568
Features are cuz it's a little unclear

978
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,384
And I think headlining today you're going to have to decide

979
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,944
Your top two features it's kind of like buying a new car

980
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,480
I must have this in this

981
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
Can I help you choose

982
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
Which car is the

983
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
All right

984
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,136

1039
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:27,264
The company's flexible term

1040
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,800
A very short amount of time

1041
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:33,152
What is the relationship between urban X in BMW

1042
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
/ Mini

1043
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:38,272
This is a really great question our Core Business obviously at Binny's

1044
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
Focused on

1045
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
Offering products and service

1046
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:46,720
Ability but really the future of the brand is going to extend more deeply into other areas

1047
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,768
Including lifestyle components

1048
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,864
And so when you think about the evolution in the automotive

1049
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,448
Autonomous connected Electric

1050
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
Shared services

1051
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,104
We're really trying to identify new ways that we can kind of serves Urban residents

1052
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
Where most of Minis

1053
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
These customers are

1054
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,456
And people who are

1055
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
Smelly looking for new Solutions

1056
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,528

Within their vehicle

1058
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,648
Is a car brand interested in improving life and say

1059
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:20,256
Lenny Williams always been a quintessentially urban Brands since it was

1060

I am super excited to have you because I love having lawyers on the show is long

00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,984
Is there willing to go out a little little bit of a lemon talk about things sometimes lawyers they don't like to do that

1081
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288
Well I'll do my best

1082
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,848
There we go I will make you say anything too crazy

1083
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:44,736
Times of legal issues associated with The Internet of Things most of which

1084
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,040
We're just going to have to find out by a lake

1085
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:51,392
Doing people and watching the court so we're going to tackle it first with

1086
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,928
What everybody is

1087
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,208
Talking about which is

1088
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,232
Privacy

1089
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,048
Data protection and privacy and

1090
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,608
I feel like we're going to get some sort of law

1091
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,936
This year at a federal level California to pass the law

1092
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,472
Last year that goes into effect

1093
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
20/20

1094
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,568
What do you see ahead for privacy regulation

1095
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,384
I think I'm less optimist

1096
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,760
Then you are that we're going to get something at the federal level this year I feel like our federal law

1097
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528
Tigers have

1098
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,088
Lots and lots on their mind they've had a bill

1099
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,624
That they could have got

1100
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,952
That's been sitting in committee for a while that regulated

1101
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,720
Internet

1102
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,304
Devices that are sold to the federal government

1103
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
That hasn't

1104
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
Passed yet

1105
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
And sitting around

1106
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
For a bit

1107
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,424
That was kind of a landlord

1108
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,216
That was I read that long I was

1109
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,240
Wow that is like

1110
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,312
Brightwell

1111
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
Hello government

1112
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,664
I think you put your finger on the other problem right they don't

1113
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,944
Necessarily

1114
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,808
Know or have their arms around what they need to do to do more than the bare minimum

1115
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
So4

1116
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,136
This issue to be legislated on it

1117
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,928
National level I do think that will

1118
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Actually happened

1119
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,768
But I think what we will probably see

1120
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,560
On the Internet of Things front is wet

1121
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,096
I think we'll also see on

1122
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
Privacy front

1123
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
Is the state

1124
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,168
Start to enact

1125
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,448
Their own laws

1126
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Is there

1127
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,240
Citizens are fed up

1128
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,800
Pressuring their local lawmakers

1129
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,592
To put something in place

1130
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:18,176
At the state level and we start to get this Patchwork of

1131
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:21,248
Different rags in different places that

1132
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
As a practical matter everyone

1133
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,880
One house to comply with if they're doing business in all of the states of the United States

1134
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,928
So most of the LIE

1135
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:32,512
So far have dealt with the physical security of devices

1136
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,304
We're talking about things like

1137
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
Hey

1138
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,120
Let's not have hardcoded passwords

1139
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,912
Let's make sure you force people to change

1140
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,728
Passwords it's very much kind of good behavior

1141
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,008
In a device-level

1142
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,032
In contrast

1143
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,872
That's what happened with Europe with gdpr as they actually did legislation

1144
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,896
Protected

1145
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,944
Data and I think those are kind of

1146
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,224
Worth breaking apart

1147
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Just a little bit

1148
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,784
Because obviously one is about

1149
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,624
Security

1150
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,208
Picture day like crazy how do you say legislators should

1151
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
Define the problem

1152
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
Privacy fence

1153
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,048
Security with iot devices

1154
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,704
Well I think The Regulators in the EU have swept iot devices in Ride Along

1155
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
Anything else

1156
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,800
Just they haven't made their gdpr law device-specific

1157
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,336
So if you're

1158
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,360
Reaching

1159
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,176
If there

1160
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,736
Tenants with any of your devices

1161
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
Citizen how your hand

1162
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
Data

1163
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,368
Can be brought before one of their tribunals and

1164
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,904
Find quite a bit

1165
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,696
Approach that

1166
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,488
Could see us lawmaker

1167
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,304
First take Internet of Things has its own

1168
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,864
Specific problems that I think as you

1169
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,496
Alluded to States like California and others are trying to make sure that glaring problems like her

1170
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,520
Coded passwords

1171
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,056
The Tetra are dealt with

1172
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,080
But just

1173
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
Because

1174
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:55,455
There are specific laws directed at the internet of things doesn't mean that those devices

1175
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
Also have

1176
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:00,319
To comply with data laws or the people putting those devices

1177
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,135
Out there and then managing the data that they collect with

1178
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,207
Okay so we probably should see

1179
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:12,095
Data privacy laws and then specifically

1180
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,655
Secure your devices lock them down

1181
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
Yes

1182
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,959
I think that's very likely

1183
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
The makers of

1184
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
These devices

1185
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,031
Have to deal with both kinds

1186
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,615
So you're not as optimistic as I am about a federal

1187
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:28,223
I feel like the industry the tech industry is actually calling for this now

1188
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,807
We're going to have so many different laws

1189
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,159
Microsoft was talking at Davos

1190
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,695
Last month about having

1191
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,463
Some sort of

1192
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
Global

1193
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,279
Privacy and data regulation law

1194
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
Do you think that's crazy

1195
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,863
I don't think it's crazy at all

1196
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,887
I'd love to see us

1197
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,167
Move in that

1198
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,191
Direction

1199
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,751
Logistically difficult to get a cord

1200
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,543
That leads to a lot

1201
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,079
People can actually

1202
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,615
Enforce and understand

1203
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,943
Just like it's better to have

1204
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
A federal law that

1205
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
People can

1206
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,295
Comply with and understand and

1207
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,575
Not have to worry about

1208
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,671
Weather things are different in Arkansas than they are in Missouri it would be

1209
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,695
Nice rock

1210
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,231
Concerned to have

1211
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,255
Adequate

1212
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,535
Consumer protection

1213
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,327
Privacy and data protection

1214
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,727
Rules that are easy to interpret and follow for the manufacturers of these

1215
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,007
Spices on the other

1216
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
I think that

1217
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,687
If you can get people talking about how to bring the logistics of it about this

1218
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,967
What's the positive staff

1219
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,271
Talk about consumer rights with

1220
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,295
Gadget

1221
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,367
So right now we're just kind of figuring things out

1222
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:42,463
And a lot of times what happens is I might buy a gadget or a device

1223
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,743
Or car

1224
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,791
Or in some cases even

1225
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,327
House

1226
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:52,703
It will come with a lot of home automation or smart stuff built in the challenges

1227
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:59,103
A lot of times you don't have the chance to read the terms of service until you're actually making this purchase or until your actual

1228
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,455
You downloaded the app and now you're agreeing to everything

1229
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,247
So to me this seems like

1230
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,063
A terrible way to do things especially when you're pulling so much

1231
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,087
How much data out of it

1232
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,111
How might we

1233
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Change that

1234
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,207
It is a terrible way to do things

1235
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,511
Set the gdpr tries to address

1236
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,071
That instead of just assuming that

1237
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
People

1238
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,887
I have read and understood things

1239
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
At each

1240
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,703
Interaction where data is going to be

1241
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,495
Be collected a separate consent is

1242
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,567
Is required

1243
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,359
Fine print that then

1244
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,431
Is assumed to be applied as binding

1245
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,223
That's sort of the place where we would

1246
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:36,991
Want to get to

1247
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,015
We're not there

1248
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,343
As you point out

1249
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,927
As far as the smart home devices go it is the Wild Wild West

1250
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,231
And we're going to see a lot of

1251
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,023
Litigation we're going to see

1252
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,071
Other laws that haven't been

1253
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,863
Enacted specifically.

1254
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,167
Deal with these problems being brought in

1255
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:55,935
Play

1256
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
WYD

1257
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,239
And in some cases

1258
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:02,591
We have a legal framework in place you know we have tort law which is

1259
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,639
If you recklessly

1260
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,175
Harm somebody

1261
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:10,015
In a way that is protected under the law

1262
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
Then you can

1263
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,599
Can be sued so it's a big broad Body of Lies

1264
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,183
Deals with personal injuries it also deals with

1265
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
Things like

1266
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,743
Less tangible heart

1267
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,791
So you can harm someone's economic

1268
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,095
Pinterest you can harm someone's privacy

1269
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,119
Can harm them

1270
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,655
Emotionally

1271
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,679
That's so

1272
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,959
There are all kinds

1273
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,495
Is of torts out there that

1274
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,775
Could be brought to bear

1275
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,799
On the internet

1276
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,335
Thanks and I expect

1277
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,103
If

1278
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,383
Companies are reckless in

1279
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,919
Misusing data

1280
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,223
Find themselves in a PR

1281
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:40,991
Boiling

1282
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,271
Kettle of fish

1283
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,063
Going to see a lot of

1284
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,087
Already

1285
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,367
Existing principles

1286
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,903
Tort law thrown at that

1287
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,695
And may start to rain

1288
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
Some of the saint

1289
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:57,375
And a lot of times these aren't terrible like one of the things I think is really difficult is it very hard to prove the harm

1290
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,447
Having your data stolen for exam

1291
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,495
I guess I could say

1292
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,519
Oh my gosh

1293
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,567
Someone broke into my security camera

1294
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,871
And took naked pictures of me all over the internet

1295
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,919
That feels like

1296
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,199
I can prove harm there

1297
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:15,551
I'm hoping because isn't that one of the core tenets of these sorts of lawsuits

1298
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,367
Sure we have a right of privacy and this

1299
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,903
Country and

1300
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,975
If you've enabled someone to

1301
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,279
Be held accountable

1302
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,327
Under those kinds of principles

1303
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,119
On the date of front I think

1304
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,423
Proving harm comes down to

1305
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,215
You know if someone has

1306
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,751
Stolen your identity stolen

1307
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Money

1308
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,847
Damage your reputation there are all kinds of ways

1309
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,639
Demonstrating

1310
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
Legal

1311
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,967
Work someplace that prevent

1312
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:48,063
People willy-nilly being able to carry out those arms against you

1313
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,879
So I think that the legal system and the laws

1314
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,927
We have on the books to some extent

1315
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951
Handle

1316
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,999
This explosion of devices

1317
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,327
It sure would be nice

1318
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,095
To have

1319
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,143
Thought given

1320
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,167
And Analysis given

1321
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,983
That actually address

1322
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,311
Squirrely in head on the problems that these devices

1323
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
This present

1324
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
That might not

1325
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,407
Easily dealt with under the laws we already have

1326
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:18,271
Sure I'm thinking of things like have a corporate wellness program and

1327
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,831
My manager somehow gets data about

1328
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,599
My sleep pattern

1329
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,879
What's under this this is not have

1330
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,903
Today

1331
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,207
We're not too far off given house

1332
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,279
Some of the insurance companies are treating data from

1333
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,583
Other medical devices

1334
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:37,983
They start to make decisions about like oh hey maybe you should handle this account cuz you know it looks like you didn't

1335
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,543
Sleep well last night was pretty easy let's

1336
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,103
Dennis Diane for this presentation he's looking

1337
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,663
Capable at the moment

1338
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,455
Those kind of things feel more

1339
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,247
Insidious that maybe just

1340
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,039
Crashing your car into something

1341
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,575
And that's where I think

1342
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:57,951
If it comes really challenging because these are also harms that could follow you throughout your life in a way that

1343
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,231
You may not even be aware of

1344
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,023
Write that I love your exam

1345
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,839
That's exactly the kind of situation where

1346
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,935
You may not even know that decisions are being made about

1347
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
Based on

1348
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,007
Date of the people shouldn't

1349
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,335
Maybe accidentally you would find that out

1350
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103
But then

1351
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,639
How could you address it

1352
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,431
That's a really tough one.

1353
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,759
Some gray area that we're getting into

1354
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,551
Okay and

1355
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,343
This idea of

1356
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
Maybe

1357
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,391
Unknown Harms

1358
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,415
There's also

1359
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,695
Some very clear heart

1360
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,719
I said I don't think

1361
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:35,583
We think about when we buy these connected devices which is that they could be used against

1362
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
In a court of law

1363
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,423
A civil court or

1364
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:45,823
Murdering anyone

1365
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,895
Microphones I have all of this data in my house that

1366
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:52,479
It's been collected and I'm very curious how do you think that situation

1367
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:57,087
What's already evolving we've seen instances already

1368
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,903
Where prosecutors in Murder

1369
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,463
Actions and investigations have

1370
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,255
Obtain data from

1371
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,023
Relevant

1372
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,047
Peoples

1373
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,607
Fitbit's and Echoes and

1374
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,143
There was a case we talked about it

1375
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:14,495
A few times on this week in law that involved a murderer in

1376
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,775
Arkansas

1377
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
Where

1378
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,823
It was actually a

1379
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,431
Connected device on the water heater for the wall

1380
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,223
Get the hot tub murders

1381
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:24,991
Yes

1382
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,039
And they actually track

1383
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,367
2 a.m.

1384
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,927
And decided that meant this person was cleaning up

1385
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:33,951
Right

1386
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,279
Strange strange things already going on

1387
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,559
As far as

1388
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:42,399
Prosecutors getting creative how they're going to build their case

1389
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,935
Of course

1390
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,263
That's a boon for law enforcement that they have all this

1391
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,031
Data

1392
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
2

1393
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,615
Pick and choose from in trying to

1394
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,639
Prove a case

1395
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,431
It's not necessarily

1396
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,735
A boon for all the litigants because

1397
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,319
Although you're not planning to commit murder maybe you still wouldn't

1398
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,623
Be planning to commit murder when one was

1399
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
Committed

1400
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,951
And somehow you wind up in the crosshairs

1401
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
Sever prosecution

1402
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
Because

1403
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,279
Of the data that seems

1404
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,559
To you

1405
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:15,935
I might get the wrong place at the wrong time

1406
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,263
Exactly so

1407
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,543
We're definitely seeing

1408
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:26,175
It will only get worse I mean I imagine

1409
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,735
People running their hands in this way and

1410
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
Speculated

1411
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
In this way

1412
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,295
When

1413
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,319
Everyone be

1414
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
Began to have

1415
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,647
Computer where they were storing a lot of it

1416
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:39,999
Information and certainly smartphones have been a huge part of the data

1417
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Environment

1418
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:47,167
For what at least 15 years out right Supreme Court just actually it was it last year

1419
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,959
Decided on a

1420
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,751
Smartphone GPS case

1421
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,775
It was

1422
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,079
Fishing expeditions

1423
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,871
Yeah in the Supreme Court actually seems

1424
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,151
Issuing some very

1425
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,687
Smart decisions about

1426
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,711
What smart devices

1427
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,015
So we can keep our fingers crossed that that

1428
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,039
Trend

1429
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,063
Continues

1430
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,463
But the other thing you mentioned civil cases are I'm sure that people

1431
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,023
Wondered about all the data on

1432
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,839
Devices before there were things like smart light bulbs

1433
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
Smart locks

1434
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
Smart watches

1435
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,191
Smart sleep apnea devices

1436
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,215
So it's just

1437
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,751
Throwing a whole lot

1438
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,775
More data

1439
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,567
To the ecosystem

1440
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,591
And

1441
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,151
The way the legal system handles that

1442
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,943
Again this is a question of

1443
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,807
Principles that are hundreds of years old being applied to the

1444
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,343
Conundrums that we're facing

1445
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
Today

1446
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,647
And those principles actually

1447
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,695
Do a pretty good job of

1448
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,231
Trying to make sure that

1449
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,255
We're having

1450
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,535
Fair trials

1451
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,559
Evidence has

1452
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:47,583
To be

1453
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,351
Credible

1454
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,887
It has to be

1455
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,423
Legitimate and legitimize

1456
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,471
So if you're going to introduce something

1457
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
You have to

1458
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,311
Be able to have an expert

1459
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
Come in and

1460
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,615
Say why

1461
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,919
The jury or the other Trier of fact

1462
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,943
If it's just a judge

1463
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,967
Entrust

1464
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,015
The conclusions that are being drawn

1465
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,551
The date of the

1466
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,087
Put forth in court

1467
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,695
So that's going to be true and Civil Trial or a criminal trial in order to trust

1468
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,463
The state at its

1469
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,767
Going to have to clear some hurdles

1470
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,559
Being

1471
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,351
Evidentially

1472
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,375
Credible

1473
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
Unacceptable

1474
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,935
Before it can

1475
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,959
Do the job and

1476
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,007
Show somebody

1477
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,799
Illegal act

1478
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,335
So while I am

1479
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,895
Concerned about being at the wrong place at the wrong time

1480
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,711
And less concerned about you know Murder is getting

1481
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,991
Caught up by their device

1482
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
That's right that

1483
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,575
The last concerning but when I think about civil

1484
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,599
Trials

1485
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:47,231
Nervous about like who can subpoena my Fitbit data

1486
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,767
Like if there is

1487
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
And that's just a random

1488
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,863
In case I don't know why it would be in a lawsuit with someone

1489
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:53,887
My Fitbit data

1490
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,423
What are the basic

1491
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,215
Rules that we should be aware of

1492
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:00,799
Apps like how is that data access to has a say in

1493
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,335
Yay or nay to it

1494
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,895
Right so if you're a party

1495
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,919
2

1496
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,687
A lhasa

1497
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,503
A civil lawsuit and that data is relevant

1498
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,319
The same dispute in the last shooting that something that might have

1499
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,623
What the judge whether it's relevant

1500
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,439
But if you're a party and it's relevant

1501
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,023
If it's under your control then you have to Fork it over

1502
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,815
Often times with these

1503
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:25,119
Internet of Things devices it might not be under

1504
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,167
Control

1505
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,007
Repository

1506
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,799
And subpoenaed from there

1507
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,103
And again just as if that party hat

1508
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
Document

1509
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,151
Just the fact that it's

1510
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,199
Hard coded data doesn't

1511
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,735
Mean that they don't have to

1512
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,271
Turn it over if there's

1513
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:45,343
A subpoena or a court order that says that they should

1514
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,135
To help resolve this dispute

1515
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,183
So a good question

1516
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:54,559
Would be what is the data retention policy going to be for these devices

1517
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,119
How much of the stuff is going to live on for

1518
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,423
Perpetuity is it going to be

1519
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,215
Various Emeril so that

1520
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,239
Can't be

1521
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,055
Subpoenaed in used

1522
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,615
Company by company what they decide their policies are

1523
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663
Obviously

1524
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:12,223
The date is very lucrative so they have some

1525
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,527
Hold on to it

1526
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
But at the

1527
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:18,111
Same time do they really want to be in the business of

1528
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:21,439
Having to Fork over data to feel people's

1529
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,975
Lawsuits another dispute

1530
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,743
Sometimes

1531
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,535
People, knock on the door

1532
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,327
Company and say Hey you know we'd like to see

1533
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,119
Information they don't have a court order

1534
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,399
They don't

1535
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:36,799
Have a subpoena I would hope that most companies policies would be walk right away

1536
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,335
People's data event

1537
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,871
A kind and less were

1538
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,151
Ordered two

1539
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:41,919
Bye

1540
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,455
Due legal process

1541
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,271
But you never know unless they're under various

1542
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,063
Data protection regulation

1543
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,111
To decide how they're going to respond to those

1544
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:55,999
Got it well in there's also an interesting wrinkle there in that there are lots of products out there in the market

1545
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,815
Scription plans for cloud storage of data

1546
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:04,959
And the consumer in some cases may not if they don't pay for that plan have access to the data

1547
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,007
The company might still retain it

1548
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
Which

1549
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,079
I don't even want to think about that

1550
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:14,175
There's one other issue that your question raised and that is I talked about it

1551
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,455
If you're a party to lawsuit

1552
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,223
Irrelevant

1553
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,503
Under your control

1554
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,551
You have to turn it over but

1555
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,855
We talked about one way in which third parties can

1556
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,623
Can be brought in

1557
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,391
If the data

1558
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
Resides with

1559
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:24,927
The third party

1560
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:29,279
What if your let's go back to your running by the murder scene with your Fitbit on

1561
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,303
Example

1562
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,071
What is

1563
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,375
The prosecutors there wanted

1564
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,679
Have the data from

1565
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,959
Your Fitbit

1566
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,751
Because you were a witness

1567
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:41,055
And they wanted to see how it impacted you

1568
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,847
If you saw a

1569
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:43,871
A mess

1570
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,151
And if your heart rate

1571
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,175
Spite

1572
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,967
Your normal running heart rate

1573
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,759
You saw some terrible

1574
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,551
Event take place or not maybe

1575
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,111
Chancellors would want to say

1576
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,903
Is witness Ram by their heart rate

1577
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,183
Stayed the same

1578
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,207
So

1579
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,511
I could see how you could be brought into a dispute

1580
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,327
Or your device could even if you have

1581
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,607
Very little to do with it

1582
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,167
Just happened to be that you sent in the wrong place in the

1583
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:07,935
Wrong time

1584
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,263
Yes I'm going to hope I never run by a murderer as it's happening

1585
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,543
For so many reasons

1586
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:13,823
All right

1587
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:21,759
They say the Internet of Things is today

1588
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:24,063
I think it's this fact that

1589
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,367
Security researchers think that these devices

1590
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,903
In particularly like a sieve

1591
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,695
And again analogizing back

1592
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,487
Early days of

1593
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,511
Other

1594
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
Devices

1595
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,047
Tibet

1596
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,327
Are important in our lives

1597
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,351
The early days of

1598
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,375
Computers

1599
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,911
Operating systems

1600
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,703
Windows operating systems

1601
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:46,847
Also according to security researchers and demonstrably according to events that happened

1602
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,151
Leaks like a sieve ultimately

1603
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,175
The

1604
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,991
Operating system manufacturers got on top of

1605
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,527
Is that issue and

1606
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,295
Got

1607
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,855
Somewhat ahead of the cat and mouse game

1608
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,391
People trying to compromise

1609
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,159
Advice

1610
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:00,927
And

1611
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,207
Attached devices

1612
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,255
And took care of

1613
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:08,095
The public using their tools and I think that that's the

1614
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:08,863
The problem that we

1615
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,423
With the Internet of Things

1616
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,191
Sort of

1617
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:15,007
Idot phase in development where it's still

1618
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,543
Kind of wide open

1619
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,079
Things aren't being passed

1620
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,871
Not only are they not being

1621
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:24,479
Released in an insecure way to begin with

1622
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,063
Even just without even being hacked

1623
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:31,135
There just something that leaks data and

1624
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,927
Sense data around in

1625
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
Wasted

1626
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,719
They shouldn't

1627
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:35,999
Expect

1628
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,559
Is unreasonable so that I think is

1629
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,143
This problem that we're facing right now and I think it will take awhile and

1630
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,703
Growing pains and some

1631
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,983
Lawsuits and

1632
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,263
Bad press

1633
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:51,103
But they ultimately hopefully we will come to a point where

1634
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:54,431
The product being released in the first instance

1635
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,199
Is

1636
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,735
As good a product is it

1637
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
Canby

1638
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,551
At that time and that it gets

1639
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,343
Updated and past going forward

1640
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,903
I will be hopeful with you

1641
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:09,535
I just think it's going to take awhile to the economic incentives are quite there yet

1642
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,303
So

1643
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,631
I can't wait till Denise thanks so much for coming on the show today

1644
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,191
Thank you so much Stacy this was a pleasure

1645
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,239
That's it for this week

1646
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,775
Thanks so much for listening

1647
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,335
I remember if you'd like more iot news

1648
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:27,455
Sign up for my newsletter at Stacey on iot, will see you next week
