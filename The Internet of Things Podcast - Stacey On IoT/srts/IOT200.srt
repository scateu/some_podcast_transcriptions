Fun service that's like it's on steroids that Kevin has recently rediscovered

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,560
And I wrote about so many years ago and it's

29
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
It's a really cool

30
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,424
Anastasis way of saying Kevin really needs to read Stacy stuff more often

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
Basically

32
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
Yes that's a gentle

33
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,752

Dot IO

66
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448

67
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216
Kevin

68
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,264
Let's kick it off this week with

69
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
Some tweets

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,592
I don't know if you've seen this but

71
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,872
So Leslie Carhartt

72
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
Is it at

73
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
Hacks for pancakes

74
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,248
What's a numeral for tweeted last week about

75
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
Having to move

76
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,576
Because she is getting a smart

77
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
In her

78
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
Apartment building

79
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
However it is not just

80
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
Smart Lock

81
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
It is also a

82
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Iot hub

83
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
And I

84
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
Connected thermostat

85
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
And all of this has to be connected to

86
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
Broadband and

87
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,168
Apparently she doesn't have a way to opt

88
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Out

89
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,008
So this was an interesting thread we will link to

90
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,568
But basically Carhartt is a

91
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
Security professional

92
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
And she looked at this

93
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
And was like

94
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Hello

95
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,992
This is a big risk

96
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
I reached out to talk

97
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,600
To her about this but she said she did not feel comfortable

98
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
Because of

99
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,696
She's in the middle of this and there might be legal or other rabbit

100
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
I totally get that

101
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
That your butt

102
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,304
I did find out more about the system

103
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,376
That her apartment complex is using

104
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
It's mandating basically

105
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,984
It's mandating it's a system from a company called

106
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,288
Smart rent their basement Phoenix Arizona

107
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
They've raised 5 million in fund

108
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
Actually just as recently as November 28th

109
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
And

110
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
They

111
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
Are using

112
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
A couple

113
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
Devices now

114
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,784
This I did not get from Leslie

115
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
So it's possible that there

116
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Pitching something

117
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
Completely new

118
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
But that seems

119
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
Unlikely because their website is full of this in

120
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
So they're pitching a

121
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
Hub made by zapato

122
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
It's a Chinese smartphone

123
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
Company they've actually

124
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,424
People ask me about their stuff at

125
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,960
Decent in there

126
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,288
Using a Yale lock that is for residential

127
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Services

128
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
And then the

129
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,640
Modem inside the Hub is from Huawei

130
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
And there's a thermostat in

131
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
Leak sensor I'm not sure

132
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,016
Who makes the thermostat or the leaks

133
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,576
Let's dig into some of the issues

134
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
I mean cuz we talked about and we actually get many questions from renters about how that you know

135
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
Mayfair

136
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
Play smart

137
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:23,423
This is different in that the complex is mandating this is what you're going to use and you have

138
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
Have to have it

139
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,751
There are a lot of issues here

140
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,543
Yes the first issue I have is

141
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
It's not up

142
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
Writing that is a problem

143
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
A multitude of

144
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,711
Let's say even if it were opt out

145
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
I think there's actually some

146
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
Serious wedding issues

147
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,623
Happened here and there's also some questions I Think About by Billie

148
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
So let's talk about the issues first

149
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
Go into liability

150
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
So

151
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
The modem

152
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,559
That they're using inside this

153
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
And the fact that

154
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,631
Domodomo

155
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
A zebra

156
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,959
And it's been accused of being an attack vector

157
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
And there hasn't been

158
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Patches

159
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
So

160
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,615
People who live in these

161
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,431
Their thermostats there leak sensor

162
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
Interlocks are going to

163
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
Connect to this thing but they actually

164
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
Don't own the house

165
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,831
Nor can they patch The Hub

166
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
I want to

167
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
So any time there's an issue

168
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
Vulnerability

169
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,487
Basically they're relying on

170
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
Smart rent

171
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
And zapato

172
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
Or the underlying

173
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Hardware vendors

174
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
Providing service inside this

175
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
Zapato hub

176
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
Hatchet

177
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,007
And as we all know that doesn't all

178
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,335
Right and to be honest with me we kind of

179
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,151
Have the same issue to a degree in that

180
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,759
Like if my wink Hub has some kind of vulnerability I'm relying upon wings

181
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:48,159
But I also have the choice to say I'm ditching Wing because you guys don't pack your stuff and these folks won't have that option

182
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
Write in a real estate management

183
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
Who's installing this

184
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,047
They may be excellent

185
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
Property Management

186
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
Are they extradite

187
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
Team management

188
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
Insofar

189
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Nothing that they are

190
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Inside out priority

191
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
For them

192
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
Necessarily to get this

193
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823
Commend

194
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Did you want it bad

195
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
Ashley to go to smart

196
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
And get them to lean on their van

197
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
Really long chain

198
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,783
And even aside from that I mean the fact that

199
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
The modem itself is

200
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
Huawei modem

201
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
Personally I'm not

202
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
Sold on

203
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,815
Using modems from Chinese companies as a major

204
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,863
But you're obviously it's a concern

205
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,423
Other people including the US government

206
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,727
And other countries governments to say

207
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
Don't be using these because

208
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
We found a lot of

209
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:41,663
Townhomes to China sending data and so on so forth so that's an issue right there is all the same device

210
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
Yeah I mean imagine if your a government employee

211
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
You're not supposed to

212
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
To take your work home

213
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Care physician

214
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,623
But even if you're not in a highly secure position

215
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
You do have to question you know

216
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,975
Oh man is my modem doing something

217
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
And again

218
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
This is not something you choose

219
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
We also have

220
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,631
A GitHub

221
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
Repository on

222
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
A hack of this

223
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
Particular Hub so

224
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
There was a gentleman

225
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,847
Andrew McFerrin who's basically got this Hub in his house and he's like oh

226
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
This is neat but I don't want to use the

227
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,175
Smart rent software I want to use

228
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Call my sister

229
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,991
So he basically created an empty

230
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,295
Bridge and brought all the device

231
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
Capabilities into his own

232
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:27,231
Which is great but I meant to say 99% of the renters in this complex are not going to do that

233
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
And now let's move to the door lock

234
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
This is actually where

235
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,095
ICD

236
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
Serious problems but also

237
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
A reasonable solution

238
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
Already exists

239
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:40,287
So smart when is apparently using a Gehl door lock that is for residential

240
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Not for multi

241
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,895
And you guys maybe thinking a who cares but

242
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
Multi-family unit

243
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
Metso apartment building

244
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
Actually have different

245
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,295
Regulations around fire code and safety issues

246
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:56,415
So this is why a lot of us can't put smart locks in our apartment buildings because the

247
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,255
Apartment building has to have access and they have to be able to give the fire department access

248
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
Cyst every apartment

249
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,607
Write with these residential locks if you don't have centralized

250
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
Control

251
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
Is unclear if smart

252
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
Is actually providing that

253
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
You don't actually have

254
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,007
The capability to let

255
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
And and there's also

256
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Surprisingly

257
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Backups

258
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,383
So this product doesn't have a mechanical

259
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,223
Just as a father I guess like a Bluetooth file.

260
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,319
It has no physical it's a punch button or a phonak

261
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,439
So yeah recommends that used product in an environment where there additional entry points

262
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
That may not be the case in the park

263
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
In fact it's likely not the case

264
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
And also with the

265
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,655
Power goes out or the internet goes out the lock doesn't work

266
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
Yeah

267
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
Yeah me and your keys are a big deal

268
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,055
You may not have it on you but at least a nap

269
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
Apartment building

270
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
You can go downstairs

271
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
A super I'll give you the key

272
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
So

273
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
That's a little issue

274
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
Yeah

275
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Those are some of the things

276
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Ring's End

277
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
If you think about

278
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
Using Z-Wave

279
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
With

280
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
Apartment building

281
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
There is a possibility of interfere

282
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
There's also concerns about ADA Act

283
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
So American with

284
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Disabilities Act

285
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,863
Says everything has to be accessible for people

286
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
And I'm not

287
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
100% clear on how this might

288
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Affect people

289
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
But you know it's worth asking

290
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
The questions

291
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
Checking if you are blind

292
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
You can't punch in your

293
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
Keypad

294
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
You don't code

295
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
That's

296
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,991
Not usually do not have the ability

297
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
They light up butts

298
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
Real on them so that's an issue

299
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
And then

300
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,415
There's an interesting thing that I hadn't really thought a lot about

301
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Shabbat

302
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
Follow

303
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
Shabbat which is resting on the Sabbath

304
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Which is Saturday

305
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
And

306
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
In that time you

307
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,423
You can't use electricity you can't do a lot of

308
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
Xterra lots of

309
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
I've had a couple friends were

310
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,799
Ox and it's always really intriguing to learn about the

311
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
That's hardcore

312
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,919
So if you think about having an electronic lock

313
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
It may not be Shabbat

314
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
This is not Orange

315
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
Two people in the smart helmet

316
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
Actually Whirlpool has a Shabbat

317
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
Be sure on their connected washers and dryers

318
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
Which I thought was kind of neat

319
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,535
So I don't know if that's something the smart right people are thinking about but

320
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
It's something you have to

321
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
Think about especially if something's mandatory

322
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,495
Yeah this it's a unique situation because I've never heard of a mandatory

323
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
Smart apartment in Ohio

324
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,383
Cassidy and I totally understand where he's coming from because of that

325
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Backer alone and I mean

326
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,783
She was kind of mommy she wasn't joking but I mean when she first told her that she's like I guess I have to move

327
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,111
And that's kind of what I thought of it I laughed and then

328
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:40,511
He brought this up again before the show and there's a really long it's right about this and like she serious she may have to move because she can't

329
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
What does not want to abide by this

330
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,351
Mandatory nature of

331
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,655
These devices these particular devices

332
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,471
What it would mean for our everyday usage

333
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,567
I guess she have to supply the power of the internet as well so she's paying for that

334
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Yeah

335
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
Yeah and I will say

336
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
So

337
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
Looking at this

338
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
I talk to lots of smart

339
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Apartment

340
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
Actually interview the CEOs of 2

341
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
To companies that

342
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
Provide smart

343
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
Capabilities for apartment building

344
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Felicity Mormon who's

345
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Stratus

346
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
And say Pike

347
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Who is a Toyota

348
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
In Direction the ones who helped

349
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,047
Educate me many years ago

350
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
How about some of the requirements

351
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Swift connected

352
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
Homes in apartment

353
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
It's in those are voluntary

354
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
And they do a lot

355
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
Like I had an hour-long conversation

356
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
About locks

357
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
This is not something that should be

358
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
Be taken lightly

359
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
And

360
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,991
This feels very ominous

361
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
It feels like

362
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
The beginning of a backlash

363
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
This could create a backlash against

364
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
Connectivity

365
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
Connected device

366
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
In general

367
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
If it's not rolled out the right way

368
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
And I will also say

369
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:47,071
And Titus back to what I saw at CES and even my interview with Mike Wolfe later on

370
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:52,703
We're actually seeing a lot of companies install de-facto Wi-Fi or connectivity in their products

371
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,519
There won't be a non-connected

372
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Adoption

373
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,407
Are we holding back the future I don't know but we still have so many data in

374
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:05,247
Privacy and security issues that I think it's okay that people are like yeah I don't trust

375
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
You know it's not like a

376
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
To me it's not like a

377
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
But I ate

378
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,367
Knee-jerk let it react

379
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
Right now it's

380
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
There should always be an option for a non-smart

381
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
Device I mean even

382
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,815
In the future however far you want to take it out

383
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,375
No I mean you can't buy a car today without

384
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
You know certain

385
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,447
Electronic safety features in

386
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
Those

387
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
I need my mom is

388
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Fairy

389
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
Anti

390
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
Digitization of cars

391
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
But you won't buy a new car right now because

392
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
She doesn't want all of them

393
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Electronic features

394
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
True but I mean those are

395
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
Those are safety features

396
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,111
You know these are not safety features these are convenience features

397
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
Well some of them are and some of them

398
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,183
So a leak sensor icon

399
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
Seaway apartment

400
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
That I actually had

401
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
My apartment flooded because

402
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
The apartment above mine

403
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
And had a burst pipe

404
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Any regrets

405
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,703
I can see a legitimate reason why apartment community might want that in the

406
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,775
But that's very different than men dating

407
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Connectify

408
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Or

409
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
How did the resident

410
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
So there are other ways

411
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
I'm with you

412
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,479
Alright so we're not going to solve this

413
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,575
But stay tuned because hopefully we'll find out a little bit more I reach out to

414
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,623
Smartvent and its investment team

415
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
To try to figure this out

416
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
And

417
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Maybe

418
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Maybe

419
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
Maybe she doesn't have to move

420
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
That would be nice

421
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,583
Breaking your lease is always a

422
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,631
Pain in the proving that you're not breaking your lease

423
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Police terms

424
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,215
Change is always a pain

425
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
Okay that's how we feel about

426
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
So good luck

427
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Good luck anyway

428
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
Who actually has

429
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,663
Actually if you have to do this you should drop us a line

430
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,991
Intelius cuz I'm very curious how these things are working out for

431
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Okay

432
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,807
Speaking of

433
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
Marie kondo

434
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Marie kondo

435
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
We haven't spoken to her yet I was going to say

436
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
I don't know what we're speaking of you guys I'm

437
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
Worst singer ever

438
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
Worst Segway ever speaking of that

439
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
This

440
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
We are actually last week

441
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
Was inspired by

442
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
The life-changing Magic

443
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,007
Tidying up in the Marie kondo show on Netflix

444
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
Todoist Gadget

445
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,127
I wrote about it in the newsletter but I'm going to give you the free thing

446
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
You guys know I'm moving in

447
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
Roughly six months

448
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
5 months now

449
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
And I was

450
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,551
We're about to put our house on the market and they're like

451
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,135
EBay what are you going to leave on the walls

452
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
So

453
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,231
I did the condo-style thing where I shoved all of my

454
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,791
Two devices or their boxes if they were installed in the

455
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,839
The wall and I shut them all in the couch

456
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,143
And I touch them and I said hey do you Spark

457
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
Do I actually

458
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
And

459
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
I decided which two

460
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
In which

461
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
I didn't want to keep it was really helpful.

462
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,127
Because of this I was trying to figure out what

463
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
Put in there and I just couldn't come up

464
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
System I kept waffling back and forth

465
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
I don't know

466
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
Do I want to keep this do I want to uninstall it

467
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,343
Put a new person coming into the house finest

468
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
Incredibly complicated and never use it

469
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Columbia West End

470
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
Possibly a vulnerability

471
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
The results

472
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,559
Keeping the connected thermostat on the wall

473
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
So those will convey with the

474
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,167
My Lutron switches will convey with the

475
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
The house

476
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,727
Has will the Lutron hub

477
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
The monitor

478
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
What else

479
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
My beloved

480
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
Delta touch

481
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
To. O

482
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
With Madame a

483
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
Stalled is going to stick around

484
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
I know

485
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
I can't see a reason to like

486
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
I mean

487
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,855
Yeah you love that thing I do love that too

488
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,415
But I love it so much that in my new house

489
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,743
Not my rental house I'm going to be staying in for a year but in my new house

490
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
I will actually get one of those

491
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,863
So that stays in the house the MyQ

492
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
Who stays in the house

493
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
Chamberlain garage door

494
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,239
I will probably buy a new one

495
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,519
I even buy a new one of those

496
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
It's unclear cuz who knows what

497
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,127
What that situation will be

498
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,175
Going to take all my hue light bulbs with me

499
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,759
So that goes away and I'm probably going to install a Lutron

500
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
Switch actually where they

501
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
The Hue bulbs were

502
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
Just to make sure that

503
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,159
Are the main living room area the house has

504
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
Attractive light

505
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,743
Write paper be a consistent experience

506
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
I also have

507
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,583
A bunch of different connected lights in my house

508
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,399
And I'm getting rid of all of the ones that are not Lutron

509
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,703
Because I don't want somebody to have to like

510
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
Install Apache wraps basement

511
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Here's the Leviton app

512
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,639
Remember when they come in they're going to bring their own mattimeo

513
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
Google or nothing

514
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,479
And the Lutron lights work

515
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Even if you have nothing

516
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,039
They're still wonderful dimming light

517
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
It's just nice

518
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,879
And if they decide they want them to work with something else

519
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
They work with

520
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
Homekit Google matinee

521
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
P

522
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
Thermostats

523
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
The Nest will work

524
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,607
With Google and Madam a

525
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Will not work with

526
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Door lock

527
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,495
I didn't keep any of the connected door locks because my connect

528
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
The door locks are all Z-Wave

529
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,359
And one was an STL. But that was a review genocidas in the back

530
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,223
So I decided nothing Z-Wave or zigbee with stay because I don't want them to have to deal with the

531
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
And finally

532
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
The connected doorbell

533
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,599
I talk to my realtor

534
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
And

535
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
He said a connected doorbell with

536
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:05,791
Be good I had to get back the nest doorbell but I did reinstall my August doorbell

537
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
So they have that and then I left the normal doorbell

538
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,679
So that's basically what

539
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
Will convey with my

540
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
And

541
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,031
How I kind of came to that process

542
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:22,175
Yes or no like I said don't have like a more consistent cohesive experience because you've kind of outfit at the house

543
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
And leaving your leaving the house with Lutron

544
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,551
And everything else would work without a hub so

545
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,903
Let me know it's a nice selling point and yeah you love your play some things but hopefully it

546
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
Is Keeling

547
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
To potential buyer

548
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,583
Because in a couple wet in six months or so I'll be talking about hello here's how I outfitted my

549
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
Rachel house

550
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,935
And it's funny that you wrote this up

551
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
And took this Plunge

552
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:50,079
Which is actually similar to when you don't want to know about a year-and-a-half ago you read it here

553
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,895
Completely remember he went through all your devices

554
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
I did my other gadgets

555
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
I think it was

556
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:01,343
Yeah but the difference is you know it was what did you want to use versus now what are you going to leave behind

557
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,671
And you got me thinking of a subscription cleanse

558
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
Smart Home

559
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,511
And I've already started it because

560
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
I have

561
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Have a nest

562
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:16,959
Camera in my front window of my home even though the door to my house that's on the side of the house cuz we have an end unit

563
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
In the Townhomes here

564
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,847
And it just looks out of the driveway and it's been well worth the subscription price because

565
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
When our car got hit last

566
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,479
Summer I guess it was we captured on video I had this

567
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,039
Social service and go back and look at all my video

568
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
And

569
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
You know I got $1,500

570
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,927
Switches what the repair bill was from the offending

571
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,487
Driver's insurance company no questions asked because

572
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,351
But I really need to pay like $10 a month for that

573
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:49,471
I don't think I do and this is not a solution to everybody would do and I totally get that but I'm like you know what

574
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,871
I'm just going to save that money and I'm going to throw an SD card or microSD card in a wyzecam which is a $20 camera

575
00:18:56,127 --> 00:19:00,991
I don't need alerts for out there I only need that to see after the fact of something happened

576
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,551
I don't need a subscription for that was my thought

577
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,903
And I canceled the nest subscription on that camera and then actually

578
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,975
Added in a subscription set pretty much a wash and triple savings

579
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,023
On to the nest hello doorbell

580
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,423
Because I do want the history of that in case somebody like it is trying to mess with the front door or anything like that or package

581
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,567
I just get taken that's it out there so it's worth paying for that but for any area that I just want to

582
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,871
See after the fact and go back in time

583
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,687
I don't need a subscription with wyze Cam SD card

584
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,991
So I'm going to continue I think paint

585
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,551
Canary subscription because that covers multiple

586
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,879
Cameras and is kind of like if somebody breaks into the house and I can cash

587
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,439
Capture video from two different angles so

588
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,839
I'm really starting to take a hard look at that and I know how you feel we talked about subscriptions in the past I'm not a fan but you raise a good point from

589
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,399
Business continuity perspective for these companies

590
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,191
So not going anti subscription

591
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,519
But I'm trying to think about where does it make sense

592
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,919
Where must I have one where I was where do I really not even well in how many subscriptions as part of this cleanse did

593
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
Tally help how much you spend a month

594
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,783
Well at a higher level idea

595
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
But they were not your smart

596
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,415
Home subscriptions are also music and video services

597
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
If you have any of those

598
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:19,071
I didn't get rid of any however I have saved money B

599
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
Cause

600
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,191
Even though I am almost an AARP card number officially

601
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,287
I am back in school and now that I have an edu address

602
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,567
I'm getting

603
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:34,943
Hulu showtime and Spotify for $5 a month as a student

604
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
Which is far cheaper than

605
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
Elaine's

606
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
Yeah Spotify is it the family or individual

607
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,623
Individual that's okay

608
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,671
That's still like $20 savings right there

609
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:51,839
Outside I save on that and there's others subscription deals I'm looking at as a student as well

610
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:55,935
I'm just trying to figure out what you how much I really need to like outlay for

611
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
Things I must have from Subs

612
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
Description standpoint in general

613
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
I like it

614
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
All right

615
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,127
Well Keep On Keepin On my friend

616
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
We'll see let's go to

617
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
News

618
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
There are new logo

619
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,527
Power Wifi chips

620
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
Silicon labs

621
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,367
And this is exciting because I have

622
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
Happen

623
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,208
Skeptical that Wi-Fi can get to a low enough PowerPoint

624
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,000
We're talking for example of

625
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,792
Getting rid of Z-Wave and zigbee stuff

626
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
In my house and

627
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
One of the reasons is that requires a

628
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,472
But one of the reasons there are so prevalent is because they're super low power and they're mesh

629
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
So

630
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,032
They're extra resilient and they don't

631
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
Long battery life

632
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
So

633
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,896
I'm always excited about things like me

634
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,688
Bluetooth and now

635
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:43,040
Low-power Wi-Fi so this is half the power of existing Wi-Fi according to

636
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,856
Now there are a lot of caveat

637
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,904
Can we talk about radios and

638
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Power consumption

639
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
There's things like

640
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Hey

641
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:55,584
Is the RF environment really noisy that means like are there lots of devices trying to transmit be

642
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
Because that makes it

643
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,656
More power intensive to transmit

644
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,728
Or is it farther away from the Hub

645
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
Because that also require

646
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,568
It basically has two quote-unquote Shout

647
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Louder

648
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
To be heard

649
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,664
So you got to think about all of those things

650
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,968
These are benchmarked

651
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,272
Ideal performance situations

652
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
So you're real mileage

653
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,368
Mayberry but we are seeing Wi-Fi

654
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,160
In battery-powered situations

655
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
Etsy yes we saw the new Schlage

656
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,256
WiFi powerlock Hampton products

657
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,072
Has their new Wi-Fi power array lock

658
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,120
So there's a lot Happening Here

659
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
And with these new chipsets

660
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
There should be

661
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Hopefully

662
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
Even more

663
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:41,408
Yeah and I'm interested from a different perspective and at y'all probably being overly optimistic here I know these are for

664
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,200
Iot applications

665
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,992
But I still want to see

666
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
Li-fi

667
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
Headphones

668
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,344
That can connect to the cloud for assistant

669
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,440
Not this day I put an assistant in your ear that has to connect to your phone

670
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
Open Bluetooth

671
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,096
Yeah you keep dreaming my friend I know and I wanted hope AR 300

672
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
Episode will be talkin

673
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
That's two years away

674
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Pirate

675
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,496
Microsoft they admit is

676
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
Defeat for court

677
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,640
They're pulling a big speak no no just kidding

678
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,968
Microsoft is interesting you know with the whole smart

679
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
Speaker space

680
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,064
We don't see too many speakers with Cortana in there

681
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,416
And I have a feeling we're not going to see him anymore and that's because

682
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,488
Satya nadella the CEO of Microsoft

683
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
Basically said that

684
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:34,144
We don't really see Cortana as a competitor to Madame a or the Google Assistant

685
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
We really think it should be a

686
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
Skill

687
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,008
That should work with those assistance

688
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,288
And that's

689
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,336
To me a small bit of tooth

690
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,872
Feet in terms of

691
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
The smart speaker space

692
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
It also means that they're going after work

693
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
More with

694
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,784
Google Amazon to do for their Integrations

695
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,600
With Cortana and Amazon actually has which is

696
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,696
Promising for them but I don't know I don't think it's going to have with Google

697
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
To me this is so fascinating

698
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
Because

699
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
Microsoft

700
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,840
Cloud level so it's Azure Cloud competes

701
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
Very heavily with

702
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,168
AWS and

703
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,216
Less so with Google Cloud cuz

704
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Microsoft azure

705
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
Number two in the space

706
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
And I'm just like

707
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
Peso

708
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Interesting

709
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Dislike

710
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
Another word for inside another level

711
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,688
Peter Leahy

712
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,992
Yeah that's the way it is in this market

713
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
So

714
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,064
I will say goodbye to Cortana on devices

715
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
Possibly hello to

716
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,136
To telling matamata

717
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,440
Activate Cortana to do something on my

718
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
Windows

719
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
All right

720
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
Let's talk about

721
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,560
Abode this is

722
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
The

723
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,864
Security system it's

724
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
Excellent

725
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,400
I have

726
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
Heard from

727
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
So many people

728
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Who have this

729
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
But they love it

730
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,776
And this is the Abode gen1 but now

731
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
Thursday bojan

732
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
To Gateway

733
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
This will begin shipping next

734
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
And

735
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,176
It features 4G cellular back

736
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,968
Z-Wave in it

737
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,760
And those are the big new things

738
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
But Kevin

739
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,088
Will tell you a bit more about what the heck this

740
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,928
Yes so the above systems you haven't heard about it

741
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,744
It's really more of a it's a hub as well as like I said

742
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
Security type system because

743
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,328
They make motion sensors in

744
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Door window sensors and such

745
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,448
So as you said it also has 40 backup so it's next

746
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,472
Next gen for them

747
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:17,824
People who bought the first gen which generally have been very happy with it

748
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,152
They don't have to pay the full price for it because the

749
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,992
Full price just for the basic bundle is 279

750
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,016
With the Gateway

751
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,344
And it goes up from there if you want to add like their Kinect bundle over there

752
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,648
Sakura bundle you can pay $360

753
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,696
But you can get the Gateway if your

754
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
Previous abode

755
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:39,072
Gen 1 hour for 199 so it's going to save you $80

756
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,376
You're not going to have a transition

757
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,192
From the old device to the new one in a sense because

758
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,800
You have to manually re-enroll all your connected devices so there's no

759
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
Automatic

760
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,616
Set up enforcement with a new one

761
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,432
If you have a gen 1 device and you love it

762
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
You don't have to

763
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,016
They're going to keep supporting both gen 1 and gen

764
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
Can two devices

765
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
Sense is true

766
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
This is true

767
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,648
They're bringing better Z-Wave connectivity to

768
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:10,048
The Gentoo so it would mean that's one possible reason you might want to upgrade and the 4G cellular backup is also in the

769
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
Another reason but if you don't need those

770
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:17,728
You can just stick with what you got unrelated note there's no announcement that they have homekit support

771
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
40 yet

772
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
With abode

773
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
They do say that

774
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,944
There's an apple and they plan to have additional news to announce soon as we continue to work with the Apple homekit

775
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,736
Getting so it sounds like a

776
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,784
A near certainty that's going to happen soon

777
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
Ring made similar nouns

778
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
And we've been waiting for a year-and-a-half on

779
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,440
Well they'll sign acquisition

780
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,000
Okay fine

781
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,840
Alright let's talk about quick news bits or more quick news bits

782
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
Airpod 2

783
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
With Rupert health

784
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,192
I am excited about the

785
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,728
Cuz I believe that

786
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
Well I don't just believe this

787
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Proven fact

788
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
That you can get a lot of information

789
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
And from your ears

790
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
You can get

791
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,640
High quality

792
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,688
Brain data high quality

793
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
Heart rate data

794
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
High quality

795
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,272
Galvanic skin response

796
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,576
Stata big word

797
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
And

798
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Did you take a

799
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
Skeptical

800
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
No doubt about it

801
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:13,536
And we have talked about this before you're bullish on this I'm kind of bearish on this because

802
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,584
I have an Apple Watch which has

803
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,448
All those types of sensors are most of them I do not have the Apple watch 4 with the ECG but

804
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,240
Don't want that so that's fine

805
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:28,128
So do you have the current airpod switch don't have any sensors whatsoever but I wear them when I run in the griefer

806
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
Stream music from iWatch

807
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,688
If I have the watch

808
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,248
I have no interest in airpod 2 with

809
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,552
Health Center Schoharie have the health center

810
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Additionally

811
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
Emily Catherine data

812
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:44,512
When I wear the headphones it's not going to be like all day. Because you're not going to wear these all day so

813
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,304
Don't have an Apple Watch against

814
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,352
I just want to track

815
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,704
It's another way maybe to track like your runs or something if you don't want an Apple watch

816
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
Those are very expensive

817
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:58,336
You pop that your pots in to go running and you can grab data

818
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,640
I will also in I'm with you on the airpod

819
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,712
I'm kind of like a do we need that no but

820
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
Icees

821
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Starkey

822
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
The hearing aid come

823
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
Actually showed off something

824
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,880
Really cool wish this their new Livio

825
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
Hearing aid

826
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
That has

827
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232
A lot of sensors in it already

828
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
And they're actually tracking

829
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,328
Steps but they're also doing things like fall data

830
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Text now with

831
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,168
A hearing aid is something that you actually leave in almost all

832
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,728
I thought that was

833
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,544
That's one of the reasons that I'm so delicious

834
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,360
Excited about this cuz I see a future where

835
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
We going to convergence

836
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
Earphones

837
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
And things like

838
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
Medical hearing device

839
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
And suddenly you have the

840
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
These things basically in your ear all the

841
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,600
The time in a performing a useful function

842
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
And having that battery life

843
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
We'll see

844
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Multi

845
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
So

846
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
Taobao

847
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:54,400
Yes let's talk about node-red which I thought was a brand-new thing but Stacy correctly informed me

848
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,984
That she wrote about in 2013 and we talked about it at least once before the show

849
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,056
My favorite was the fact that we've had this conversation

850
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,336
Before like a year ago

851
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,896
Yeah

852
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Oh it is

853
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,688
Awesome I have check

854
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,016
Memory upgrade

855
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:16,416
For those who don't remember such as many talking about node-red it is very interesting and worthwhile look if you go to no draw

856
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
Red. Org

857
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,232
It's basically

858
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
I call it

859
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,560
If this then that on steroids because

860
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,864
It has so many

861
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,936
He usage has so many integration points

862
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,264
It's rather technical support more technical than if this then that

863
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,616
And yet it's not at the same time because it's a drag and drop interface almost like

864
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,992
The MIT programming language

865
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,808
We keep old blocks into make me know to create program

866
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,416
He got a flowchart out what you want your devices to do how you want them to communicate

867
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
And

868
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,584
Send messages notifications and you can connect things to databases that mean that you could go hog-wild and the only reason

869
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,216
My radar again today is because somebody on the Reddit home automation subgroup

870
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,264
Had completely outfitted a

871
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,568
Many many devices entire home

872
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,896
With no dragon head always float charge and I was like oh this is

873
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,712
School so yes we have talked about it before no it is not

874
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
Specifically new

875
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,552
It's worth a look if you're looking for a

876
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,368
Different way to automate your

877
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:24,256
Home automation in your smart home and you can run it locally like on a Raspberry Pi or you can run

878
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,840
In the cloud through AWS Microsoft Azure Etc

879
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
So it's another option

880
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
And you can use it

881
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
With home assistant

882
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,472
So home assistant is one of those

883
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,496
Downloadable

884
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,032
It's like open have

885
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
Homebridge

886
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
Is it downloadable thing

887
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,384
Run another pie and run all your devices

888
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,176
And you can actually use node red on top of

889
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,736
Have an easier way to program your

890
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
Pair devices

891
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,064
So why should

892
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
Say it isn't just for this

893
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
It's actually very

894
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,464
Popular in becoming more popular in the industrial iot

895
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,304
So we're seeing some people in the OT World Maybe

896
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,120
More familiar with this type of user interface trying to

897
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
To adopt it

898
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,936
For setting rules around here

899
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
Smart buildings

900
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,240
And also

901
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,616
So this is I mean it's a pretty robust platform it was developed at IBM

902
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,896
Wayback

903
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,944
14 is Kevin said and it's

904
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,480
It's a good soft

905
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
I like it

906
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,600
I think that covers a lot of stuff

907
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,392
This week please run the gamut

908
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:27,488
Let's go now to Riot podcast listener hotline

00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,544
5126 to 3

933
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568

934
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
To 4

935
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,360
And leave a message

936
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,408
So let's get to this week's

937
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
Voicemail

938
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
This one is from John

939
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
Stacy and Kevin

940
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
Calling regarding

941
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
Wi-Fi

942
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,112
Lights

943
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Interested

944
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,928
And your recommendation

945
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
Brightest

946
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,256
Normal bike

947
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,048
A19 size

948
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,328
400

949
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
What

950
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,632
150 watt type

951
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
Size bulbs

952
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
Seems to me

953
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,008
There's not too many very bright ones out there

954
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,312
Strictly shouldn't wenzhou

955
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
Hubless

956
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
Are Wi-Fi

957
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,920
Songs that don't need a hug

958
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,456
Cheats that most of

959
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
Topping out at

960
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
Seawater

961
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,808
Maybe 75-watt

962
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
Mange

963
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,112
Monkey looking back

964
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,672
I'm looking for a soft light dimmable

965
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,952
Situation

966
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,256
And I'm also curious if maybe it's

967
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
Smarter better

968
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
You get a c

969
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
Smart

970
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,144
And then just use regular

971
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:14,752
So this is an interesting question because most of the smart bulbs that we

972
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
Found

973
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:19,360
Pretty much max out at like a 75-watt equivalent lifx

974
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,664
Seems to be the brightest in terms of lumens

975
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,784
We started looking 450-watt Replacements we came up short

976
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
There are

977
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,344
Definitely LED bulbs

978
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,928
We did find a couple but we would not recommend them

979
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
Because they are from

980
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
Randall

981
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
Random

982
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,304
This is true

983
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
This is true

984
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,888
Books that we're not very familiar with I guess I should say yes

985
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,936
To your thought about

986
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
Getting a Smart Switch is

987
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,776
Probably the way to go and

988
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:52,896
Because of that you're going to save on the cost of your balls because the bulbs won't be smart

989
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:58,272
Your switch would then be no obviously cost your maybe forty $50 but you can find

990
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:01,856
Many many LED bulbs that are in the range of

991
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,136
Any word from

992
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,440
15 at least 1600 lumens

993
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,768
If you want to go with the inexpensive route EcoSmart

994
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,584
Has 100 watt replacement LED bulbs

995
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
They are

996
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,912
Basically

997
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,984
Price of $10 27 for a two pack

998
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,800
So that's where you're saving your money since the smarts aren't there

999
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:25,152
Cree also makes 100 watt replacement LED bulb but there could be a little more Spencer your PayPal

1000
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,992
$13 for a dimmable LED from them

1001
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:35,392
We definitely found all doable because you mentioned him both so it was one non-dimmable I'll just mention in kg

1002
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,696
She decided don't need that effort every single light

1003
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,720
Phillips does make

1004
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,048
A 100 watt replacement non-dimmable LED with about

1005
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
1500

1006
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
Lumens

1007
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
And that'll cost you about it

1008
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,216
$12 97 for a two packs are the same as 1 crib also

1009
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,544
You're obviously paying a little bit more for the dimmable Factor if you want that but

1010
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,336
You got a bunch of options there

1011
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,128
I would go with the switch quite honestly

1012
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,432
There's just if you need that kind of brightness

1013
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,968
And then Tim ability Factor

1014
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,528
Might as well save money on the balls I just put the switches in

1015
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
Yeah I agree

1016
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,344
And having

1017
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,904
And having it be dimmable is probably really awesome

1018
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
Awesome because

1019
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,232
It's not all the time you want multiple light bulb

1020
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,512
I was giving you $100

1021
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
What's right

1022
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
Sometimes

1023
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,840
Dial it back a little

1024
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:19,424
Yeah these are all soft whites as well so just put that into the

1025
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
Equation as well

1026
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:26,336
Stacy you're more of a light switch off Smart Switch person than I am so what are your favorites

1027
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
And what are the cost

1028
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,896
Sister Joan has an idea

1029
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
Torso

1030
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
Lutron

1031
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
If you want it

1032
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,736
To work with

1033
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,528
Assistance you're going to need a hub

1034
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
So you may not

1035
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
Want to go that route

1036
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,624
Route those are about 50 V bucks

1037
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
Her

1038
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
Switch

1039
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,720
The other options are Leviton

1040
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:47,328
And those are about 40 to $50 but they don't require Hub their Wi-Fi switches

1041
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
WeMo has a Wi-Fi

1042
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,656
Switch that works really well

1043
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,472
But I don't love the fact that it's really bright

1044
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,776
Has all these lights on it so it's not great for like

1045
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
And

1046
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,592
Those are good

1047
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Brilliant

1048
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
What is a light

1049
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
Panel but it's

1050
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,944
Overkill if you just want

1051
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,736
Lights it also acts kind of a smart home

1052
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,784
So it's coming to Mableton

1053
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,600
Integrates with cubed integrates with all this other stuff

1054
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,880
It's a neat concept

1055
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,952
But it's a lot of work to program and

1056
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,720
It may be Overkill

1057
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,280
And it's far more expensive as well

1058
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,608
So it's brilliant a 1 gang switch cost $300

1059
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
Or the control a two gang switch

1060
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,704
It's going to cost $350

1061
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
Echoes up for their

1062
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,032
You can use the fancy

1063
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,312
Capacitive touch screen

1064
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,104
Boxer thermostat

1065
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
Music

1066
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
All kinds of stuff

1067
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:36,224
You pay more but you're getting more in that case of if John wants

1068
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,272
To add features he has that option then

1069
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
John I don't know if

1070
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,832
I need to go that far

1071
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,880
I mean if you want to go that far it's a nice enough

1072
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,160
It's your money

1073
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
All right

1074
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,000
Well I feel that we have reached

1075
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,280
Good closing

1076
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
Remember

1077
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
You have until January 31st to get

1078
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
Just call at 5 1/2

1079
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,680
623-7424 and

1080
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,984
Enter to win a Google home

1081
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
It has been used

1082
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,800
It feels kind of lame

1083
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,104
Stacy's trash is your treasure

1084
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
Exactly

1085
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
Thanks Marie kondo

1086
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,784
T2 now for our guests this week Michael Wolff of the spoon

1087
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,648
And the founder of the smart Kitchen Summit he's going to be talking about connected kitchens

1088
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,976
And the features you should look for in your next big appliances

1089
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,376
Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor

1090
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,192
This week sponsor is database provider

1091
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,728
And we have evolved

1092
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
Aloe vera

1093
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,520
Who is here too

1094
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,568
I talked to us about farrakhan's new

1095
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848
Sitri Edge

1096
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
Database

1097
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,688
You go to database

1098
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,736
Specifically for the iot

1099
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
Tea tree Edge

1100
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:46,880
Why

1101
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:52,512
To answer your question why was to try to help solving the problem

1102
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:59,168
Bridging the Gap that exists today between

1103
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,752
Is that two roles that they already

1104
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:12,224
Connecting the sheer amount of operational sensors that are producing thousands of data points per second

1105
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,016
Is provided by the information technology systems

1106
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,856
Okay and how does a database

1107
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,120
Justin Bieber

1108
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
But you can also have

1109
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
Edible just like chains

1110
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:37,312
Hub spoke or even met too many repetitions with filters to separate which they deliver sent where

1111
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,872
It's almost like a fool

1112
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,040
Are the basics care of that for you

1113
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:56,256
Motor model database this entity provides both SQL and nosql

1114
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,792
A computer requires

1115
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
SPAC High School

1116
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,400
I forgot to give you the flexibility of the skin

1117
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,680
Kevo store interfaces

1118
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,752
You can drop hundreds of thousands of data points per second

1119
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:11,360
Still having to worry with the extra latency traduced by relationships are complex SQL queries

1120
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,664
Traditional relational database for example

1121
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,480
SQL database

1122
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,808
So you can integrate your business intelligence your machine learning

1123
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:25,184
Or any other bit of processing system that requires a standard interface has inquired it in real time

1124
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,488
This can be done directly on the edge

1125
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,280
Or on your central repository for

1126
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
And what about

1127
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
Security

1128
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:43,104
It supports most of the algebraic systems like raspbian Windows RT Oracle decor

1129
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:49,248
Karate application without having to write a single line of code

1130
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,600
Not to mention the sport to Ida platforms like thing works from PC

1131
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,880
That sounds great

1132
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,696
So where can I buy listeners find out more information

1133
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
About seats

1134
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,120
Sensor data in real-time

1135
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:09,216
Supplication to put a belt on a Raspberry Pi that you can easily do by yourself if you want

1136
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,544
It's available on fire cam. Cam

1137
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,824
If you'd like to watch it

1138
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,064
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things

1139
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,600
Podcast today's guest

1140
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,880
Is Michael Wolff

1141
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,696
Who is founder of the smart Kitchen Summit and

1142
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,232
Publisher of the

1143
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,792
Spoon he's also a former colleague of mine

1144
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,840
Gigaohm and he's

1145
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
Now on

1146
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
Bigger better

1147
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,168
Smarter things

1148
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,960
So Michael are you doing

1149
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,008
Be good Stacey thanks for having me on

1150
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,032
Man thanks for coming

1151
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,312
And so I love

1152
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,592
Smart kitchen gadgets

1153
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,128
Like my favorite thing in the world

1154
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,432
Actually it is not my favorite thing in the world

1155
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:53,760
My favorite thing in the world is probably my nanoleaf lights they don't do anything

1156
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,296
Next up is the kitchen

1157
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,576
We just got back from

1158
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,672
What I saw was a lot of the big Appliance

1159
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:06,304
Fans are now actually offering real connected devices in the kitchen not just

1160
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,144
You know things are wifi-connected but actually trying to build smarts into

1161
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
I saw a fridges that

1162
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
Eye cameras in it

1163
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,984
I saw lots of ovens with

1164
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,264
You know AI

1165
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
You cooking

1166
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,336
What are the big trends that you're seeing

1167
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,616
From the major

1168
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,920
Yeah I think you had a right

1169
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:26,016
One of the things I wrote about for malachor this year was We would see

1170
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,040
The big Appliance maker

1171
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,320
Finally integrating

1172
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,344
Intelligence

1173
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
Features

1174
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,648
Things like cameras and

1175
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,952
Kind of things that understand what's in the cook

1176
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,256
So I think you saw that cross the board was it at

1177
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,680
Since they had their countertop oven this Century what I would call in sick of June like oven they also have their smart

1178
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
That word actually had

1179
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,568
Augmented reality on top of that memory as you cook

1180
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,616
You can put stuff in then come does an overweight

1181
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,640
Video screen

1182
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,663
They also have this

1183
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,967
Really kind of interesting modular oven

1184
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,247
From KitchenAid that Elijah Wood

1185
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,319
Steamer like a grill in there you also saw this

1186
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:06,463
From Samsung they're entering the fourth generation of the family of Samsung's been going at it for a while now with the refrigerator and freezer talk about quite a bit in

1187
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743
For the first time really

1188
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,815
Family Hub refrigerator actually has food recognition

1189
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:15,167
So they've had the camera in there for a while if you're shopping

1190
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,447
You can see what you forgot

1191
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,519
That's okay that's kind of interesting but like the ability to actually recognize

1192
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,847
Food pantry opens up some other interesting applications

1193
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:26,687
I think what we saw from the big Appliance makers is moving beyond this idea just like

1194
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,735
Adding WiFi and app control

1195
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,903
Adding more intelligent creatures around cooking like Machine Vision play GE Building in the Hesston capabilities or the countertop

1196
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
Cooktop is that you

1197
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,207
She talking to the bachelor

1198
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,511
Cookware to all these different things

1199
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,839
Together showed me that the big of ice makers are really kind of making a Porsche

1200
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
Into the kitchen

1201
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,631
And adding work

1202
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:50,751
Okay so then my question to you becomes as a consumer

1203
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,799
Let's pretend that I am building a house

1204
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,335
Cuz one day soon I will be

1205
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,871
And I'm looking at all of the

1206
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
The stuff

1207
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,687
I feel like they're still several ecos

1208
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,759
There's like whirlpools got there yummly stuff

1209
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,039
Dimension GE and Heston

1210
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,319
So

1211
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
How is that working

1212
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,951
I think we're still early stages right so even though the big eyes art

1213
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
Getting in we are still

1214
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,791
In these worlds were there separate Island

1215
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,839
Technology nothing really in her Opera

1216
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,423
You have guys like in it that are trying to ascend

1217
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,727
Is an operating system if you will

1218
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:25,823
You mentioned yummy that's really kind of whirlpools play the kind of build your own the other bag of ice

1219
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,359
I figure they said hey why don't we just build her

1220
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,895
Tire wall Garden

1221
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,431
Technology

1222
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,455
But I think that

1223
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:36,319
That's kind of the challenge of early-stage markets we saw the same thing in the Smyrna or nothing really kind of work together

1224
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,343
I think that's kind of.

1225
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
State Route with

1226
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,159
The kitchen until I take the challenges

1227
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,207
Moving forward as I had to get these things dinner Opera

1228
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,999
So I think Amazon Echo

1229
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,047
AG I think those are kind of the deaf

1230
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,887
Acto interoperability layers where they basically kind of circum

1231
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,423
Vented and circumnavigated

1232
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,959
What the kind of War

1233
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,775
Smart kitchen Technology support on Technologies were trying to be

1234
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,591
Stepping back into your question of if you're trying to build a home

1235
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,895
I still think it's so early that I don't think a lot of

1236
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,431
People who are building homes in

1237
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:07,551
Customizable kitchen if you're redoing your kitchen so I can $50,000 thing the Challenger is like

1238
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,343
Okay what do I put in there from a technology purse

1239
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,391
The water this app isn't available

1240
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,463
So all people really think he is a Sub-Zero fridge

1241
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,255
Why won't like the G

1242
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:22,655
Cafe line about technology I think if you're moving into new home you're thinking maybe about smart home but I just

1243
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,983
Don't think you were there right now think about I want really advanced technology make

1244
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,031
It is early

1245
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:31,871
And let's just be selfish just for me since I have you in urine

1246
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,919
And it like 18 months

1247
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,199
I am going to be

1248
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
Moving into

1249
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
To a new home

1250
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,015
Buy new Appliance

1251
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,575
So maybe not witch

1252
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,903
Companies I should look at but what are the technologies that you

1253
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,951
You think will be there that I should be like

1254
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,255
I will not settle for anything less than

1255
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,583
Well I don't know if it's

1256
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,399
Too early but I think it'd be really cool. Is building a new kitchen

1257
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
The new home to have

1258
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,519
The wireless power Consortium technology and my countertops like that'll be really cool

1259
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,311
To have a inductive kind of

1260
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,847
Power transfer technology

1261
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,871
You can be silly have a

1262
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,431
Qi Power Pad in your countertop that'll be pretty cool

1263
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,223
I think it may be too early 18 months might be

1264
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,015
Be kind of kind of course I know that they're trying to push it

1265
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,575
Kelly's big guys are really pushing hard to get more

1266
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,903
Technology for offerings in their high-end and

1267
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,695
Keep pushing you down towards their kind of mainstream

1268
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,535
Start off on the high end products of the moving into their Main Street

1269
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,839
Tokaji eats a GE Cafe line

1270
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,863
Pretty high-end

1271
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
The challenges

1272
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,911
You may have to have a mix

1273
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:33,311
Brand type of kitchen if you want like the most advanced cooktop the most brands like if he wants like Steam

1274
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,591
I've been like you want most

1275
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,407
Refrigerator you need to sound like this hodgepodge a brands

1276
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:43,039
It's cuz like right now you can't really look at anyone Brandon say Hey Dad this great line up across all the built-in Technologies

1277
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,343
That have great smart technology really ban

1278
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,367
They're all different

1279
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:50,975
Let me break it down maybe this way so you don't have to tell me that Brands but like

1280
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,255
What should I look for in my

1281
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,047
Prevention cameras

1282
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:59,423
Maybe food recognition so let's do that tell me which are the Advanced Technologies I should need in

1283
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,191
Jacob replied

1284
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,215
It's a so we'll start with the fur

1285
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,263
I mean Samsung

1286
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,799
I think LG

1287
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:09,407
Has been there as well really trying to make the refrigerator the Showcase in the

1288
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
Location of Ike more advanced

1289
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
Technology

1290
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:17,599
We're on the fourth generation family Hub refrigerator like I said this is the first year that there cameras inside really understand what

1291
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,135
Food is I think it's pretty

1292
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
Interesting

1293
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,695
The channel for me is like iced tea packets

1294
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,487
Say how committed to Samsung long-term

1295
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,559
Do I want to spend $4,000 on a Samsung family hub

1296
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:31,423
And will that have a Tinder why cycle it seems like they're really committed it's like they've been going at the store

1297
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,727
For 5 years now it seems like they're going to be there

1298
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,031
Everything from the second generation on

1299
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,823
Upgrades to the latest software

1300
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,663
If I were working in a fridge you know you probably go a Samsung or LG

1301
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,735
I would definitely want cameras inside and Wi-Fi connectivity

1302
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,527
Other than that like there's nothing really

1303
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,831
From the mainstream technology perspective

1304
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,367
That you can get much more than that

1305
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:54,207
Does not the electronic nose built into these fridges yet right there's nothing like that

1306
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:54,975
Some of these

1307
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,767
Kaiser think about putting like warming

1308
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:02,143
Defrosters in the fridges so having like Beyond freezing at you going to warming but that's not available yet

1309
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:05,215
Okay and then let's talk about my other

1310
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,263
I demanded my Smart Oven

1311
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,031
In 18 months

1312
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,823
I would love to have

1313
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,103
An oven with a

1314
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Cool

1315
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,919
Screen on it weathers to television

1316
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,223
Or like a monitor or like an augmented reality

1317
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:20,063
Translucent screen like you saw with like a Whirlpool I think that it really cool I think

1318
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,599
You've grown to like your June

1319
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,135
So having something

1320
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
That recognizes what's in

1321
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
Inside and kind of

1322
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
Programs

1323
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,231
The cook

1324
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:33,375
In monitors the cook I think that'll be pretty cool not Technologies definitely moving into the built-in appliances I would demand that

1325
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,911
I like the idea modularity

1326
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,447
KitchenAid have this module

1327
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215
New

1328
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:43,615
You be able to add steam functionality or add like a grill function out in there or I got cooking Stone

1329
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,383
So is that in

1330
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,151
Inside the oven

1331
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,687
It's inside the oven

1332
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,223
And it's basically add-on

1333
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,247
So there's actually like

1334
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,527
Can interface at the back of the venue

1335
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,551
Depandi sings In

1336
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,343
Haha okay cool

1337
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
My stove top

1338
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,903
I would go with induction

1339
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,719
I know that induction cooking isn't as popular in the US

1340
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,743
But I think that there

1341
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,279
So much more you can do

1342
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:05,375
Your kid is less likely to get burned or just less likely for a fire to start

1343
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,191
And you can do things like high-precision cooking like what the heck

1344
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:11,263
I like the GE oven with Heston technology built in

1345
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,799
You could do this guy to cooking her

1346
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,615
Hi Precision cooking you can't actually do that with fire

1347
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,639
Felicio

1348
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,919
How about my dishwasher

1349
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,943
That's a great question

1350
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,223
I would like

1351
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,271
Kind of love these little countertop

1352
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,343
A big built-in kitchen with

1353
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
He's really kind of

1354
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,391
High-end appliances

1355
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,439
But like the tetris going to be shipping I think

1356
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:33,023
By mid-year and there's another one I forgot the name of it there's another smart

1357
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,815
Countertop dishwasher that actually

1358
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,607
Uses like a fraction of the water

1359
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,911
In a much smaller washwell

1360
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,935
I really like this

1361
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,983
I just think it's such a smart idea

1362
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,751
Would you say

1363
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,543
Cuz I was envisioning

1364
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,079
So I'm on the market for those

1365
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,359
Drawers that pull out

1366
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,431
Dishwasher drawers that are not full size dishwashers coz

1367
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,967
I have a family of three so

1368
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,247
It's like two of those wood

1369
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,527
Do just fine for me but

1370
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:57,087
What are you talking about is this an actual countertop

1371
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,623
Yeah so he works

1372
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
Announce

1373
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:03,743
In 2018 SES the Tetra dishwasher is a truly cool

1374
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:06,559
Dishwasher design Fathead that frog design

1375
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:10,399
Design company frog made it look so sexy it uses a gallon of water

1376
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,935
I can do to spice up

1377
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,215
So it's a much

1378
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,567
Ecological footprint like it waste Way West water weigh less energy

1379
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,847
It also has

1380
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:22,175
If you're living out of an RV or if you're living in a dorm meeting at U of a dishwasher

1381
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,711
All right I'm seeing these

1382
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,503
Okay and then let's see

1383
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,271
I feel like

1384
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,087
There's tons of countertop appliances

1385
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
That people can draw

1386
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,207
Just buy those feel great for like a retrofit are there any standout

1387
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,023
You know countertop appliances that you're like oh my gosh

1388
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,815
If you buy a dumb coffee maker

1389
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,607
You're making a huge mistake

1390
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,143
You know coffee is like

1391
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,935
Waiting on the

1392
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,703
NetSpend

1393
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,983
Copy machine for a while

1394
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,055
But there are some interesting connected coffee makers coming out

1395
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,383
I'm waiting for a Kelvin coffee roaster one thing I've been waiting to do that

1396
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,783
You trying to roast Tech coffee in the home and does it cost a roaster called Kelvin that should be shipping this year they're actually running a little late but that

1397
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:03,391
It's kind of fun what's your coffee drinking habits are you someone who drinks everyday

1398
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,159
Super automatic

1399
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
Coffee maker

1400
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,487
Bruised it but hey

1401
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,023
I've been looking at the bonaverde

1402
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:09,791
I'm not going to

1403
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
I think looks amazing

1404
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:15,423
We try that other problem is you really need to

1405
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
Capital One apply

1406
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:20,799
Right I think the roast grind Brew

1407
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
It's like

1408
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,639
I think that at one picture too much I think the roasting

1409
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:28,479
Built into an appliance that also crying that bruises maybe too much

1410
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
You're saying that's over

1411
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,063
I tasted the coffee and I was

1412
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,855
I am so here for

1413
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
But okay

1414
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,415
We will not worry about that

1415
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,439
Let's talk

1416
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,743
Talk about any other countertop Appliance

1417
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
I should be like

1418
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,559
This must have intelligence

1419
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,351
No I mean

1420
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,887
I don't think you want to add a total

1421
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,911
This retarded sake

1422
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,679
I think

1423
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,215
Steam is underrated

1424
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:54,079
Yeah Wilson Rothman of the Wall Street Journal that has the same thing he said it ever been like that's a category he's waiting

1425
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
The pop

1426
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,151
Waiting for customers just makes your food taste

1427
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,711
So you saw 2 Ball come out there generation

1428
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:03,295
Do this like about a couple months ago I did a review of it I really like the

1429
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,343
The taste of food this is another new guys

1430
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,879
It's always a

1431
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,903
Countertop oven

1432
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
Smartest

1433
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,231
But it has female tattoo

1434
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,023
And such a little cheaper than the June

1435
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:18,655
There are some like I said I mention the whirlpool one that actually has steam capability they can add as a feature

1436
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,703
I do think if you're moving to new house I think

1437
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:24,031
Steam is like 7 years real look at cuz it just makes food taste so much better

1438
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,311
Induction and

1439
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,079
Steam

1440
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
Keep that in mind

1441
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,127
So also

1442
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,431
With the Samsung family fridge for example there's a

1443
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,503
GE just showed a downdraft

1444
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:34,783
Kind of system with that

1445
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,063
27 in

1446
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,087
Screen audit

1447
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,135
I feel like I saw something else

1448
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,183
The screen on it and I was kind of like

1449
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,975
So what

1450
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:49,375
Talk about where the Hub in the kitchen should be or where we need all these screen cuz I certainly don't need every Appliance.

1451
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:51,167
Come with a really expensive

1452
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,471
Beautiful screen that I'm just going to get grease all over

1453
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,799
I mean I think that Amazon or Google

1454
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,823
Marcus plays

1455
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,847
That was really smart

1456
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:02,943
Because if you look at the kitchen like it's where we spend so much time it's the Gathering

1457
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,807
Spot and we were making food purchasing decisions and you can't do all that as much as I like

1458
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,599
Amazon wants you to avoid shopping

1459
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,623
You're not going to do out

1460
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,647
Was I not filling out a

1461
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,415
React shopping list

1462
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:16,255
So I think that this idea of having the smartest ways on countertops

1463
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,023
Really is

1464
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,839
Martin you're seeing those really take off what appliances

1465
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,607
Should take a belfie

1466
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,167
I just don't know if it's going to be the refrigerator

1467
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,215
I think this refrigerator has a very center

1468
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,263
Space in most homes

1469
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,591
Don't know if I could going to see tens of millions of like family have pepper

1470
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,359
Refrigerators at

1471
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,151
Speak strength screen

1472
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,735
It's not a bad idea but I think that's kind of a limited set of people they're going to do that

1473
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,783
BGE large

1474
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,831
Display GE I think that's

1475
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,647
Pretty interesting idea I think it's probably

1476
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,927
Refrigerator conversation

1477
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,951
So I don't know

1478
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,231
If I can pick a winner

1479
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,303
I think it may be a mix of all these in a water smart countertops

1480
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,399
Swayze I think that did you see the Whirlpool oven with augmented reality on it

1481
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,447
Yeah I said it

1482
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:01,055
I just don't know if people who watch a lot of television on that everything but I do think I got to be like

1483
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
Really interesting

1484
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,871
Into manager cook and maybe do some shopping on

1485
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,639
Okay

1486
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,943
And I feel that we have to talk about the

1487
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,015
We have talked a lot about Trends but it's time to get

1488
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,551
Time to get in the now

1489
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:16,159
So The Wirecutter just put out a review it was

1490
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,439
January 15th

1491
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,743
I love The Wirecutter I've actually in

1492
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,279
Full disclosure arrive at work for the wire

1493
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,815
Hair cutter and done some reviews for them

1494
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,095
But they are headline

1495
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
It broke my heart

1496
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,143
June oven review

1497
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,935
Not the countertop oven used

1498
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:32,031
You should buy and basically the wire cutters Michael Sullivan

1499
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
Who I don't know

1500
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:39,455
I'm sure he's a wonderful person who knows what he's talking about he basically said that you nothing at $600 is not

1501
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,479
Not better than their

1502
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
Cake toaster oven

1503
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
Is the Cuisinart

1504
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,551
Tob 26

1505
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,575
0 + 1

1506
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,111
That'll stick with you

1507
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:50,975
They're like you know what cost more and it doesn't do as much and they're big beef seem to be the

1508
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:53,791
What's frustrating to find programs I don't know if

1509
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,583
Is food just wasn't recognized

1510
00:53:56,095 --> 00:54:01,727
He couldn't adjust time in increments that work for him I don't know so I was curious

1511
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:02,751
Your take on this

1512
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:06,079
That's because you know I know that you know that you enough and in one of your

1513
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,871
Your colleagues really loves his

1514
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,431
I mean I feel like people when they do reviews

1515
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,711
The projected WaterOne

1516
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,271
What this means for like ever one right

1517
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,831
I think people are so unique and how they cook

1518
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,855
And have such

1519
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,159
Specific views and what works for them

1520
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,231
Michael Sullivan I don't know him I haven't read the review in full by like

1521
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
I'm sure he's

1522
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,303
Trying to extrapolate like how he likes his

1523
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,631
Kitchener like and what he kind of likes and fell faults but

1524
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,655
You have someone like

1525
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,447
You I think you have the June one

1526
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,751
Chris Albrecht with June to em both love it

1527
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:41,151
I know that a lot of kids would that you and because it's very easy to cook with her kids so I can't really speak to what his mean

1528
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,943
Problem was I do think there's

1529
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,735
It's right I think that their society by

1530
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,783
It's a small countertop oven

1531
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,831
I also just think that there's

1532
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:55,231
General Luddite feeling among a lot of people and a lot of editorial people that just reject on his face like

1533
00:54:55,487 --> 00:55:00,863
More technology in the kitchen they just want us to use kind of old-school tool to grew up with we don't need more SmartThings

1534
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,655
This is glass maker space

1535
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:06,751
Face in the home one of the things he talked about was the cameras fun to use but it doesn't make

1536
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,519
Cooking easier

1537
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
Which

1538
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,567
Rang very false

1539
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,687
Because to me it makes it tremendously easy because I just put something in and I don't know how that if it identifies

1540
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,735
Then I don't have to know how to

1541
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
Yeah I mean

1542
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,039
Are we all do this

1543
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:24,415
Are people right but I think often times the articles are written before review things and I feel like

1544
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,439
And I can't speak to the

1545
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,487
This Michael Sullivan tennis article

1546
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,511
I know I've had people

1547
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
Write about

1548
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,839
Things just go get that remind me up for

1549
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:36,447
It might just be that he rejects the idea by more technology in the kitchen

1550
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:38,239
Or he just found it you didn't like it

1551
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,519
Like maybe he was had to struggle

1552
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,055
What's a recognizing his bacon

1553
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,103
Yeah and I wonder if you tried to cook

1554
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:43,871
Some fancy

1555
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,407
Cuz he's talking about the

1556
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,943
Camera getting stumped a lot

1557
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,991
And I mean every now and then mine gets

1558
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:49,759
Stumped

1559
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,575
We can go like a month without it not recognizing

1560
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,391
Something because I mean we tend to cook the same things we're not

1561
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,159
I like super

1562
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,695
You have 2 player Adventure SP

1563
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,231
So I don't know

1564
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,023
This wounded me to the core of my

1565
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,303
My soul so I was

1566
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:07,679
No I mean I think he has a point where I'm looking at article now I do think that the main

1567
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,727
Probably have is like the June is actually

1568
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:14,335
It's right like it's just doesn't have that big a cavity and that's what I

1569
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,663
Pushing and asking and wondering win the big geyser

1570
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:22,015
Forgetting in getting back what we talked about earlier having these big built-in appliances

1571
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,063
Whisper capabilities I think it's going to

1572
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,343
Really be interesting cuz

1573
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,367
You can't cook it

1574
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,135
A turkey

1575
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:32,255
I can only do so much with these small cavity of mine doesn't even the Jim Bilton like his beastly the

1576
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,535
Is the countertop in a

1577
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,071
Hilton

1578
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:39,423
Container it was a really like a wall up and it was more than

1579
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,471
You're sticking the June countertop in the wall

1580
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,775
And I I will agree with

1581
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,079
With that I do wish this were in my larger ovenly

1582
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,615
Okay

1583
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,383
Well

1584
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,919
I just I had to bring that up

1585
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:52,735
And I am looking forward to your next smart kitchen event

1586
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,015
Wherever it may be

1587
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,551
Where to going to be

1588
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,855
At houseware show in March I have to go to that that's

1589
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:00,927
It's a great show for countertop appliances in

1590
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:07,327
In San Francisco on the future of food robots Chris Albrecht and I and that whole whole spoon team will be doing a food web

1591
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:12,191
It's a very small bet that we're having the guy who's behind the Sony aibo Ravin

1592
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:17,311
The head of Google brain come and just getting all these nerves in her room cuz I talked about how robotics will change the world of food

1593
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,847
And so that will be on April

1594
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
Intemperance

1595
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,407
It's called articulate

1596
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,175
Awesome
