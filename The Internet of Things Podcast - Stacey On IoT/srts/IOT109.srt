Yay

46
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
Get started with your

47
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
Surprise purchase

48
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160
Oh sure we can do that so West folks know the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus

49
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,696
Officially became available

50
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
On Friday last week

51
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,072
Did not expect to buy one

52
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,656
My main SIM card has been in an iPhone 7 plus for quite some time

53
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:18,496
And I've had various other Android phones for my project fi Sim

54
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,336
But my main send is now in a galaxy S8 Plus

55
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
It's the big one

56
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,736
Didn't expect like I said to get one but I made the mistake of going to BestBuy just to look at that nice

57
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,552
Mostly bezel-less display and

58
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,904
I was sold her that and some HDR video just sold me on this phone

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
So

60
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,232
Snagged on a Friday night

61
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,024
Thank you T-Mobile because

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,072
State paid $600

63
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:48,704
Gave me a $6 promo card when I ported phone numbers over back in January so which I didn't pay a lot of pockets

64
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,776
Overall I know we're not a phone charger say overall the phone is

65
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,336
Really really impressive a beautiful screen

66
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,456
The immersive news of that near bezel-less display really does make a tremendous difference

67
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:04,320
And just about everything that you do and Samsung I have to give him credit they've done a great job

68
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,112
Getting apps to work with that

69
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,440
Funky new aspect ratio of 18.52

70
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
So it's very tall that

71
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
Not so wide phone

72
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,352
R2r Shore two things

73
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,424
When is Bixby witches

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
There

75
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,984
Version I would say of

76
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,776
Almost like a Google Now

77
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:29,664
And 2 is the fact that this phone works with the SmartThings and such

78
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:36,320
Now I do not have a SmartThings Hub ideas people probably know from listening the past I went with a wink Hub but

79
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,672
Stacy you test a lot of things and I think you do have a SmartThings Hub yes

80
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,768
I do and I'm actually one of the reasons that in New York

81
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,864
At this event with Honeywell smart thing

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
Skybound

83
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
Business Development

84
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
You showed me

85
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
The Galaxy S8

86
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,384
You showed me the new

87
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
Integration

88
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
Call home

89
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
Holy mackerel

90
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
It is

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
Gorgeous

92
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,904
Automatically discovers everything on your WiFi

93
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,720
This is actually an update that SmartThings

94
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
So if you

95
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,679
When you download the app it looks Infuse everything it can it can on your Wi-Fi

96
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
But it automatically pops

97
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Wichita

98
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
You will have to manually add your

99
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
Things that I can't see

100
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
But

101
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
It's also

102
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
In this house

103
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,367
Stomach really nice shot at the Dairy Queen design

104
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
Really nice job

105
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,695
Can quitting Lake

106
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
Where things are

107
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
Obelisk

108
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
Smart home so anything on

109
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,447
When you when you bring this phone into your house and you should actually maybe try this

110
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,031
See if you can get with discover some of your wifi-based

111
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
Divisive

112
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
So in essence

113
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
Do you still even need a SmartThings Hub if you have this phone I guess that's one of my questions cuz I don't have the Hub but from what

114
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,599
You're saying I might be able to use the phone

115
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
In lieu of a hub

116
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
Yes for Wi-Fi device

117
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
That is my

118
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,839
And that would make sense because this thing doesn't have Z-Wave this phone doesn't having all the different radios at the Hub would have

119
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
That makes total sense

120
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
So

121
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:31,519
You said you had to download the app and I just checked the app and see if is pre-installed it is not

122
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
OK Google device

123
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:38,175
So I probably have to go into the Samsung apps app and download this app which is fine

124
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,759
You also noticed that the design of it is

125
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,551
Pretty nice and I haven't seen it

126
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,623
But I can't say for folks who have shied away from Samsung

127
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,183
Devices in the past because they have the TouchWiz

128
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,743
User interface over top of Android

129
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
This is now called

130
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,631
The Samsung Experience it is no longer called TouchWiz and it is very less

131
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
I don't have a lot to say almost

132
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,239
I find TouchWiz gaudy

133
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
I find it Gotti

134
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,359
What does Samsung Experience

135
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
Find job redesigning us

136
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,735
Leaving I kept the phone with me to Google New York City yesterday

137
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:18,623
Where I work I should disclose that that I work in the devices and Mobility group for make money for marketing

138
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:23,999
They were all impressed with the redesign of the software in general so you know I'm a

139
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
I made download this app and

140
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,399
Play with some of my Wi-Fi devices with the phone I have multiple ways to control them now but

141
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
I'd like to see what Samsung is done here

142
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
That is B

143
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
Latest news on Batman

144
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,175
I did mention there two things in one is Bixby

145
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,903
I think I think Bixby will be forgotten in the near future by many people

146
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,487
You forget about it because they have a dedicated Hardware button on the

147
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:59,327
As you hold the phone in your hands on the left side of the screen is you looking at it

148
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,375
Hit that button and Bixby open

149
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
The Voice interact

150
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Infer Bixby

151
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
Is not

152
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
Available yet

153
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
However you can use the

154
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:12,383
Bixby cards if you are familiar with Google Now

155
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
Swipe right

156
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,759
On a Google phone that has Google now you'll get your Google Now cards

157
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,087
Contextual Karzai show maybe traffic and weather and

158
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,927
Information that you're interested in and Dixie does that now which is

159
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231
But

160
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
It's not

161
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,423
I'd say fully baked yet it's pulling in information and putting it on cards for apps that installs hitches

162
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Play CNN

163
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,031
So show me interesting CNN stories

164
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
March

165
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
And I don't really care about those anymore

166
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
So

167
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,527
There are some good things about Bixby there are some not-so-good things about Bixby I would say it's a work-in-progress I would not buy this

168
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
Phone for Bixby

169
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,647
Because Bixby is a promise that is not yet been capped

170
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
It's probably the best way to say it

171
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,231
Okay

172
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Unveiling

173
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
Avalanche Ranch

174
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,447
That's correct. They're still working on the Voice interaction bit so I use then this phone obviously because of

175
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,567
Has Android 708 has Google Assistant built-in so I basically been using them

176
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,431
Amanda and I just use a Google shortcut to tap and then I get my Google Now cards so I'm

177
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,271
I've done some workarounds to get the functionality that I want but you're actually correct

178
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
Samsung headset at launch

179
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
The Voice

180
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,903
Peace is not very red

181
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,951
The cars that will improve over time as well

182
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
Internet

183
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,399
Come back to you later Kevin

184
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
All right

185
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
Since we're talking about Google which way

186
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
Because you work there

187
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,847
Let's talk about the other news

188
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
Google home

189
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
Google

190
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,735
Is it Google home or Google Assistant

191
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,623
Basically what we say voice recognition we're saying voice recognition for multiple people

192
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:04,511
Right start this is so here's what's the idea here is up to six different

193
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,839
Recognize

194
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,911
And unfortunately I have not tried this

195
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Out of town

196
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,031
Can I have a Google home

197
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
Write an integer

198
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,455
It is it is exciting it in sores I know it is specific to Google home not Google assistant on your phone

199
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,551
And that that actually makes sense to me because your phone has your information

200
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
You might share it

201
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,391
Calendars and other information with other people but

202
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
You don't want

203
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:37,791
Other people making calendar appointments using your phone on their account and that's busy with this.

204
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
This is

205
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
Allowing

206
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
Multi

207
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Account

208
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
And user access to Google home and I have not tried it I've seen some people say it works great at seeing some videos show

209
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,359
I seen some people saying it's not working great for us

210
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
So

211
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,199
There might have to be some tweaks involved in terms of this

212
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,783
It's hard to say I don't have one so you're right I can't say

213
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:05,439
Start in a little bit

214
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
Yes

215
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,767
Basically I'm excited because

216
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,351
Idea of being able to have my husband say

217
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
Versus mine is awesome

218
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
And it also

219
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,799
Amazon Echo

220
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,847
Which I really thought would have better

221
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Voice recognition

222
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Baidu

223
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,527
But I mean think about

224
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:36,927
About being able to say that I'm not sure I'd want to do that cuz I don't know how closely aligned

225
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,487
We have to eat in Minecraft

226
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
That that's one of my Baker

227
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
Concerns on the Amazon Echo

228
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,887
There is a passcode

229
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
Right so I think

230
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,871
You're right in some sense this puts Google home ahead of the echo ecosystem for now

231
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:02,015
At least in this Regard in general I find the echo to be ahead of Google and many other areas in this product

232
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Category

233
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
But

234
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
It's interesting

235
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
Curious to see if Amazon responds

236
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
I like the idea that yes you can like I can check my calendar maybe my wife went to check her traffic on her way to work

237
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
Our way to work

238
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:21,215
Baby the kids want to order a video on Amazon Prime for their account

239
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,615
So there's a lot of different usages and that's really what we want in a home assistant unless you live at home by yourself

240
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
You want everybody to be able to use this product otherwise

241
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,271
You spent a lot of money just for a single person's usage nuts

242
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
It's not ideal you know

243
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,647
Idle by washing machine for myself and one for my wife and one for my kids right

244
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Set point

245
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
Chest pain

246
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
Okay

247
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
So

248
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:54,239
Yeah well we're talking about Echoes and Holmes notice I just got an email from Amazon yesterday

249
00:11:54,751 --> 00:12:00,639
That Amazon Dash buttons for a really good deals going through midnight on May 2nd

250
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,223
If you buy one dash button you get two free and

251
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
You still get the

252
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:11,135
499 credit $4.99 credit when you purchase make your first purchase so basically

253
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,695
You getting all three for free once you use the first button

254
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:19,839
I already added to my card I'm going to add a third I don't have a dash button so it will be new for me I got to find a third pie

255
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,447
Gatorade G2

256
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,287
I look for coffee I couldn't find coffee that I wanted and greenies for Norm

257
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
Oh okay

258
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
Yeah I was hoping

259
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,407
I still don't have the

260
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
Flashlight

261
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Brush my dog

262
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
I have a virtual one on my Amazon

263
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
Web page do I just go to the web page node like

264
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
Which is almost equally

265
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
Okay

266
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
Actually I can

267
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
I was talking to the Honeywell people

268
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
And hopefully sometime around

269
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
They're planning on releasing

270
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,847
Immigration

271
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
Whitney

272
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,759
You can actually honor thermostats

273
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
The day that you changed your

274
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,439
They'll just basically automatically reorder your air filters

275
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
From Amazon

276
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
Nice

277
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,583
Which is actually really nice

278
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,887
One of those things where you like

279
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
It actually

280
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,943
I think I don't think about it a lot but I do think about it four times a year with the change of seasons Every

281
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
Official first day of

282
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
Spring summer winter fall

283
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
That's when I

284
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,415
Change my filter so I kind of have reminder set my calendars to reorder or go to the store

285
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,767
Yeah they're not to work around this would be ideal to have a meeting with the replenishment service built in

286
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
I was just about to

287
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
Make fun of my husband

288
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
If you can

289
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
But

290
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
But now I think you're a jerk

291
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
It's there

292
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,991
So the cooking there isn't just that it is a

293
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,295
I slept around for people who are not

294
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
On top of things

295
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
Reminder Center calendar

296
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:22,463
I keep making money on their connected

297
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
It keeps ending

298
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,071
A portion of Revenue Paraguay

299
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
The cost of having a

300
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,447
This is something we talked on a lot

301
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
When you device

302
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,847
Money everyday that you got that device

303
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
Money in your development cost

304
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
Custom Construction

305
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
Call down or something

306
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
Not going to call and get back up

307
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,095
If you're hooking up when you haven't started

308
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,935
How to support that device over the Long Haul

309
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Start

310
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
One of your subscription

311
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
It may be like

312
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Punishment

313
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
Those things are

314
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
There we go

315
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
But I'd also I'd also add

316
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,207
All kidding aside the what Andrew and I do

317
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
4

318
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,559
Nerve manual replenishment attracting these kind of things

319
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,143
It's actually smarter to have a device do it because a thermostat can see

320
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,543
If the usage has been super high in a given time. Maybe if it needs a filter sooner as a result of that right

321
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
Yes

322
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,383
You have to trust

323
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
They're just not trying to like

324
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,015
Questions I should make an extra Buck Uber with it

325
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,391
Nope nope they're trying to get more money out of me I know it

326
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
Honeywell

327
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
All right

328
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
Hitting a little

329
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
Shift because I read something

330
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,887
So excited I read in fortune

331
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
Spotify

332
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
Fortune medicine that's not funny

333
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
Spotify

334
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335
Hiring for someone to make

335
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Suffice

336
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,943
What are the stars will remember that

337
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,735
Really excited when

338
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
The Pebble watch

339
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,087
That they were going to make a tiny little device

340
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
Store Spotify songs

341
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
So when you're on a run

342
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Something without

343
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
You have

344
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
So this is what I want

345
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
We don't know what

346
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
Idea is

347
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
You need a device

348
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
You're happy about this I totally get why

349
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,967
I shook my head no no no when I saw the story

350
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Because

351
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,295
Hardware is hard

352
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:01,183
And it has become the downfall of many good service companies who have try to do things like this

353
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
I don't

354
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:09,119
Personally think it's worth the risk to Spotify to try and do this and I'm saying this of course without knowing what it is they're making

355
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
However

356
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
You know

357
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,471
You got a great service out there

358
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:17,311
You got a lot of subscribers and a lot of money flowing in through the service

359
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,639
And you can integrate with a lot of existing and then future Hardware

360
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
Do you really want to make your own

361
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,039
Hope they do well with whatever it is they do

362
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
I'm leery

363
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
That's all I'm going to say

364
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Directions

365
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
You work better with their part

366
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,791
What yeah that would be ideal because we've seen so many different

367
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,351
Wearables another device we have

368
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,655
Spotify on this and then you go to use it

369
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:48,287
And it's like well it's really just a controller for Spotify on your phone that's not Spotify on my wearable devices

370
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,103
And it was actually I had a Samsung

371
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,919
Wearables I forget which switchgear

372
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,527
I had but that was the one of the big things at lunch it's got Spotify cool

373
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
And yet

374
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:05,951
It was just a controller for Spotify on the phone and I don't run with my phone so now I can't listen to Spotify

375
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
I'm tracking my running

376
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,559
Kind of feel like oversold and underdelivered there

377
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
So we'll see

378
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
Yes if anyone out there comes across

379
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
Tiny little device

380
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
Is it my phone

381
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,055
Spotify

382
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Glass now

383
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,895
Why does it why does it have to be Spotify for you I'm just curious

384
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
Because that's that's what I

385
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
Music onto

386
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
Flash

387
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:44,095
A flash drive but if you subscribe for example to Apple music or Google play music

388
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
That's fine that's fine

389
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,263
But if you do don't forget our people who do use Apple products we can we know that

390
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,615
Google play music using Android phone Android

391
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,687
Those will sink over music from those

392
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,015
Services that you subscribe to to that way you locally

393
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,319
Carry those chains on a wearable device

394
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,135
And then go run exercise and stream

395
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
Over Bluetooth just like you would

396
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,511
With the nails that don't have to be manually

397
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,863
Pushing MP3 files over and then that whole complicated process if there's

398
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
There's options out there I was just curious that's all

399
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,471
Okay

400
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
I would like

401
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,799
Spotify Spotify

402
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:32,223
Yeah no and I mean I was a Google Play music subscriber until the whole family went and got iPhones and they're like

403
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
Apple music

404
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,111
So I I subscribed as a family plan to Apple music

405
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:46,047
Luckily Apple music works on some few things Apple makes it worse on Android so

406
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
I can you know

407
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
Stream stops

408
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Okay

409
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
All right

410
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
Picking up devices and Hardware

411
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
Idevices

412
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,127
Which is a company that is very popular

413
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
Open acquired by Hubbell

414
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
It is not the telescope

415
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,367
Anna and I thought it was humble at first in like a little figurines

416
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,695
Yes also not that I'm so Hollow

417
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487
For people who don't know what it is

418
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
Is a 3.5

419
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,071
Billion dollar

420
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Company picnic

421
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,887
Electronic products

422
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
Square

423
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
Residential

424
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Construction

425
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
Industrial and utility

426
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,359
This is an interesting purchase that because idevices is very consumer e

427
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
Yes now that they have

428
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
No they don't if it's

429
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
Non-residential residential

430
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,831
The forgetting

431
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
Show me a picture of

432
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:47,999
I hope this makes a lot of homekit accessories such as they have a thermostat

433
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,375
I don't even know what to think about this maybe it's because

434
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,447
It is actually gaining popularity in builders

435
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,775
When are taking over actually building houses

436
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,807
Purina products for new residential buildings and such and maybe even commercial bills I I guess it's

437
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,879
Just seems like I don't know what they paid for everything but

438
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,952
It just it just seems like

439
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,512
It's a very specific application of

440
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
The products and

441
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,864
I will see

442
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,496
Everyone knows that I'm not Super Soul.

443
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,032
I'm not loving

444
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,336
I didn't love my

445
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
Testing of it

446
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,384
Second love

447
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:41,248
I don't like the fact that it's only Apple in the device universe is so limited

448
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,040
Add more than user experience

449
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832
Behind

450
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,904
You are stuff that's out there in terms of like

451
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
Helping

452
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
Pinecrest

453
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,912
I like I would not buy a home if I was out buying a new home and it had a home kit

454
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,728
Absolutely new

455
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,776
No value to me whatsoever

456
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
How about

457
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,224
Weymouth

458
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,016
Yasso

459
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:19,904
This is so ironic that this news just hit because last weekend I was in the Phoenix and Scottsdale area

460
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,696
And we saw

461
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,024
On the same day in two different areas of town may have been the same car

462
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,584
A Chevy bolt EV all electric

463
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,680
With lighter on top of it so is when I go self-driving Bolt

464
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
What's up with that

465
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,520
And then I get home and then a couple days later

466
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:40,128
Which is a Google company

467
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,968
Announce that citizen testing is gone live in Phoenix

468
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:48,832
They have 500 looks like minivans I'm not

469
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,416
500 vehicles that are equipped for self-driving

470
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
They are

471
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Signing

472
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,280
People up in the Phoenix area so if you live there

473
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,072
Good for you cuz I love it there

474
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,144
But secondly you can sign up to be a an actual tester

475
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,936
How's the self-driving cars and

476
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
There's a

477
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:11,616
Maybe we can let you in the show notes the way most site that shows a video of one of the first testers it's a family like five or six people and

478
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:18,272
That size family with kids that are at activities

479
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,368
Running the kids to friends house to activities to school to whatever

480
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
You just get in the car

481
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,304
Robert needs to go where they need to go just go as soon as

482
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
So it's saving them already time and

483
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
Effort and

484
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,168
Less traffic

485
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,448
I'm so

486
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,824
It's kind of interesting I saw this this is happening quicker than I thought I did not expect to wake up public

487
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,384
Testing of waymo this soon

488
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Is it

489
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,968
The car drives itself with there still a person

490
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Sitting in this

491
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,016
Behind the wheel

492
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:56,416
It's ready to take you should say that because as I was sharing the video with people at work yesterday

493
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,952
They asked the same question

494
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
And unlike it doesn't show that the video I'm like

495
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,792
That's probably because they don't

496
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,632
Really want you to see that in the video but I suspect it still required

497
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,424
Right so they're trying to show that

498
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
Excel driving you don't need it

499
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,800
Benihana Wheeling song by Sting for a regulatory standpoint a safety standpoint

500
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:16,128
Somebody probably a licensed driver still needs to be behind the wheel

501
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
That would be awesome

502
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,200
You were like a kid she can be like

503
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,552
Eventually I could see The Happening

504
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,856
Yes it probably won't look as much like a

505
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
I don't know

506
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:34,560
We are also going to be for this next item in the show notes which is a semantics

507
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
Surely report

508
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,912
Hold on it really great information

509
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,472
Reading 15 pages on the Internet of Things

510
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,312

511
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,872
I have a DDOS attack for an hour

512
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,968
I am not in the market for a DDOS attack but now I know that

513
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,504
Less than an hour

514
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,368
All kinds of useful

515
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,440
Okay

516
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:07,072
This report talks a lot about everybody's favorite button it the movie

517
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,192
And had enough

518
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
Oops

519
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
Actually run

520
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,312
And that man

521
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,872
Routers and network DVR system

522
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,480
This is Dad let you

She's crazy

527
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,184
We all learned about aliens

528
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,720
Carolina spices are

529
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,024
Yoshi rap

530
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,816
Distinction between

Devices and iot devices

532
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
Because a lot of things

533
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
Score

534
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,544
Routers network DVR

535
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,128
Five or six years ago

536
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
Most connected devices

537
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
They do not have

538
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
Password

539
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,760
Did you allow for over the air update

540
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
Stop

541
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
From the report

542
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,464
Besides attacks against a Honeypot

543
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,488
Today's setup

544
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
Where I am

545
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,096
Much of the attacks were coming from China

546
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,144
And the United States

547
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
Coming from

548
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,704
China

549
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
Got a quarter

550
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
China

551
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
17

552
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,408
So this is actually got kind of surprised

553
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,456
It's not that

554
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480
USF

555
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,064
The passwords that were used

556
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,112
Spices

557
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,648
37%

558
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Batman

559
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,976
3% use route

560
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,792
And others the rest use some variation

561
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
5

562
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Text

563
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912
I suspect

564
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:50,752
You know it was a leopard surprising to me that 17.7% of the

565
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,776
Attacks

566
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,080
Honeypot attacks were from the US

567
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,248
I'd look at it as we probably have a higher density of devices connected devices than many many other

568
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
Trace

569
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:06,112
So it's just a matter of having the device population more than anything in my

570
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,672
Oh that's a smart thing to think

571
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,488
Is coffees working today

572
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:20,704
If you like sitting here going home

573
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
Talk about this

574
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
Here's some things

575
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,592
Disable telnet login and use SSH

576
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,688
You should

577
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,712
Use on your network

578
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,528
Actually just wrote a little bit about Healthcare

579
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Episode

580
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,672
Healthcare iot I'm shocked to find out that a lot of people

581
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,768
Actually have any idea what's on your network

582
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
You should know what time your dad

583
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,168
And

584
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,240
You know change your default credentials on all of your devices

585
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,520
Wifi router

586
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,920
Are camera everything it should be one of the first things you do when you install it

587
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
Yes I am

588
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,552
Those are kind of the big takeaways

589
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,088
Thai soccer

590
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,136
I don't know if you saw anything else that you

591
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,416
Oh yes

592
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,000
Now there's this thing is chock-full of information on

593
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:21,376
Security online security in general there's a whole section on iot which we hit some of the highlights so

594
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:25,216
This is definitely worth a read I think it's almost 80 Pages this report

595
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,544
But like I said

596
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,592
Afterwards you'll know how much you need to pay

597
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
All right

598
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,760
Quite a bit of news for people

599
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,296
Microsoft

600
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320
They did

601
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
Products including iot

602
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
Which year

603
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:54,144
Microsoft Azure is there their infrastructure-as-a-service offering for everyone

604
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,472
They also have a coyote which is a wafer

605
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,752
People who

606
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
To configure

607
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,080
Iot

608
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,920
About iot Suite

609
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,600
Call Microsoft

610
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,624
I need some

611
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,904
Microsoft

612
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
We don't have a payment

613
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,584
That don't want

614
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,376
Get Smart

615
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
I understand

616
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,104
Cities in other places

617
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
They're trying to

618
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,712
So I think this is a really smart

619
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
Yeah I would agree

620
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,136
You know when you're offering a whole package not just an iot product I think we offer package that you want to

621
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:53,536
You're going to find some businesses Enterprises that find it compelling because they don't have to manage all that stuff

622
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,864
So obviously Azure is Microsoft's big cloud play

623
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,400
In addition to

624
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:02,752
They also announced Azure time series insights

625
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,568
Which brings you the whole manage data latex

626
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:09,664
Analytic storage visualization so you can you know Annalise

627
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,736
The tons of events that all these are two devices

628
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
We presently create so

629
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:19,392
You know about that Insight how do you actually apply the information that these devices catcher

630
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:24,512
So really smart play buy buy Microsoft and this is kind of minor but

631
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:30,912
I never knew that they had an iot blog which is where they have been announcing this news so I'm just out of this to my feed reader

632
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,216
Take an Internet of Things blog didn't know that

633
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,032
Baidu

634
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,056
People who

635
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,872
Probably

636
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,944
This is a big deal for the Internet of Things

637
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,992
The time series data is basically

638
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
Time

639
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,832
Temperature

640
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
Time in States

641
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,648
Time in anyting

642
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,840
But if you're and iot if you're dealing with Device data

643
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,216
Amazon

644
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
Actually don't know what's going on

645
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:17,248
So now that Microsoft has something that's awesome

646
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,320
A couple other things

647
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
They're worth

648
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Thinking about

649
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,720
Battery operated soap reconfigured

650
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,792
Basically this is again

651
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,584
Already done for

652
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:36,192
Accompany

653
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,728
Call Microsoft

654
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
It's because they care that works with everything

655
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
Pretty awesome

656
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,152
Microsoft are actually doing some really awesome

657
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
And now

658
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,016
The show

659
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,064
Eventually

660
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,112
Which is Our Guest

661
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
Jason Shepherd to his

662
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
With gel

663
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,512
Discussing the edge boundary which is something Joe

664
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,816
Announce this week with the Linux Foundation

665
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,888
It's basically like middleware for the Internet of Things

666
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,216
Really cool

667
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,544
Iot scale

668
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
Shave him for that

669
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
Before we go there

670
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:25,856
Hey everyone this is Stacy breaking into this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor

671
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
Where is it

672
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,952
And this week I'm talking with Mark space who is the head of

673
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,256
Product for home automation at Google

674
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,328
People kisses on Google Wi-Fi and integrating it with if

675
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
So hey Mark how you doing

676
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:41,984
Good thanks for super excited so why don't you get started and tell us

677
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,288
Why you guys chose to integrate with

678
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:50,176
So we decided it was on the reading platform

679
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,248
We want to make sure that we gave

680
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,784
Consumers

681
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,600
Connected to any device

682
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,648
And that let us do you seem

683
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,464
Great new features that we had never thought would happen

684
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,864
And also being able to allow users to do things like schedule causing devices their schedule

685
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,984
So now you've been on the platform for a year

686
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,264
What type of success

687
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
Have you seen

688
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,040
Excited about that

689
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
The other thing is

690
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,624
We had a couple teachers that we didn't launch

691
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,952
When we release the router and things like being able to

692
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
Schedule

693
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,536
Prioritizing devices schedule

694
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
And

695
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,400
Are you just turn into a stew lever step platform for those features as well

696
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,704
What do you love that Google WiFi can do

697
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
The one of my favorite

698
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,080
Examples is there the engineer who came up with an athlete that

699
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,616
Allows a user

700
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,408
When your device connect to Wi-Fi

701
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,712
Start to play music

702
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:02,368
And the entry music

703
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,208
So far really use some good entry music I like it

704
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,512
What else can you do with your if denigration

705
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:14,656
Well you know what we saw a lot lizard became one of the number one use case it's so being able to connect

706
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:18,496
Lighting connected to your thermostat

707
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:23,360
That people were asking us to integrate with because if you think about the signals that Google wife ideas

708
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,152
My device connects and disconnects

709
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,968
It sounded great signals for when I get home

710
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:32,320
And we saw a lot of people leverage to connect disconnect signal

711
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600

Good morning thanks for having me

00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,208
Good morning I am excited to have you because

727
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,488
Several months ago

728
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,560
You talk to me about something that wasn't called project

729
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,608
That job was working on

730
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,032
It is no longer called project use is now called

731
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
Ajax

00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568

00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
Alright so

00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
Edgex Foundry

735
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,456
It's a big name but it's

736
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
It's just a name

737
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,552
First off why don't you start telling us

738
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
What it is

739
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
Is that you guys are

740
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,136
Trying to solve

741
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,672
The big problem right now and

742
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
And IRT is this

743
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
Fragmentation

744
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
I mean this Market is

745
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,328
It's always going to be heterogeneous there'll always be

746
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:52,960
You're different standards for connectivity all kinds of different domain experience required

747
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,056
It's really important that you partner on new Solutions

748
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,104
Very important that we push standards

749
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:04,224
But that the challenges there will never be a single standard there will never be a single choice for operating

750
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,784
You always need to partner

751
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,064
Promise to mean Experian

752
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,600
And so

753
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,928
What's needed is something that drives more interoperability and in

754
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,720
I'm cooperation between all of the

755
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,024
Different things that are inherently a problem with

756
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,048
Feeling anxiety

757
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,096
Scale is important

758
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,120
Cuz

759
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,424
An example I use all the time

760
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,776
Scale the cost $1,000 to connect

761
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,848
Matt's basically the market right now and it is it

762
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640
It's really fragmented

763
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,968
And how LD Solutions come together and it's great that there's a lot of

764
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,808
True a different diocese out there.

765
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,344
Technology spiders in general

766
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,368
Services providers

767
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,160
I work with them every day but

768
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
Defragment

769
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,000
So together we need to get to wear it

770
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:51,840
It's more of a consistent foundation so then we can go solve real problems

771
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Analytics

772
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
Services

773
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:00,544
All right and this is design for the industrial internet or kind of Enterprise iot this is not something for the

774
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
Consumer

775
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,128
Yeah yeah it's definitely focused on Industrial

776
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
You make it industrial-grade

777
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,504
You really fit the bill for commercial and Industrial use cases

778
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,344
Say people won't use it and consumer. Definitely interest on that side

779
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,904
It's built from the ground up to the industrial grape

780
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,720
All right and the focus is at the edge so

781
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,768
The idea here is that I can bring in

782
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,560
Any type of radio standard

783
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:28,192
I can have all these different sensors out there I just need to add a driver kind of to this platform

784
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,496
And it is going to

785
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,056
It's a framework for me to build to that like

786
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,360
Lets me insert all this extra other stuff on

787
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,408
So it's just kind of this middle layer

788
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,432
And now

789
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
We're going to delve into what

790
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,016
The components of this middle layer

791
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:42,784
Cuz it's pretty

792
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,576
What are we really focused on

793
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
With Ajax found

794
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,160
I'll start at the end of a high-level are good

795
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
Text

796
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,744
It's similar to Cloud Foundry

797
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,304
Super popular for building

798
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,584
Platform-independent

799
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,912
Scale Solutions cloud-native principles

800
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,496
Loosely coupled microservices you've done through open source

801
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,776
Your polyglot

802
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,056
Which means that I can run it

803
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:11,456
You like and run a python service right next to a Java service right next to a JavaScript you any number of applications

804
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
Slot together with d

805
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
Containers

806
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,320
You can deploy on a device

807
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,392
Or spread out across the

808
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Devices

809
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:25,280
You all communicating with one another so that's that Loosely coupled nature is very important here

810
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
Because I have 2 solutions

811
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:31,680
Going to spread out all over the place at the edge of the network so he's anything that's not the cloud

812
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:32,960
Whether it's

813
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,264
The Datacenter or down to the various things

814
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,080
Call spread out this is designed to run on

815
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:43,712
Gateway's so the device you're talking about specifically it's like a little bit computer hanging out somewhere

816
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,760
In a factory

817
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:51,904
The devices would you typically connect to a Gateway at the edge especially if they can't talk to the internet native

818
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,744
If it's a legacy system like that communicates over

819
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
Mudbuster

820
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:02,656
Bacnet or Canvas OR propane at or whatever that you can't natively talk to it

821
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
Navigate

822
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
People also use Gateway

823
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:10,848
Ways to do local analytics you like that they want to filter data that's coming off of all these sensors

824
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,408
And then you'll see the like normalized

825
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,224
Results of the most important data up to

826
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,272
You're the backend whether it's a server or

827
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,600
The Cloud everything can go to the cloud substrate key to

828
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,392
Our strategy at Delavan

829
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:29,280
The industry of people talking about the edge not so yes it's designed to run on the Gateway

830
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,352
But that really just any device at the edge that does kind

831
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,888
Computing for

832
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,912
Sings

833
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,936
Bringing data

834
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,984
Make it interoperate with other data

835
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,056
Do some local transformation of the data and push it out of the box

836
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:44,128
You for your choice of protocol soon as your kind of icky layers

837
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,408
In architecture

838
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,200
Loosely coupled with a

839
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,016
I can run on a single and what

840
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,088
Are the things you talked about it bringing in the data

841
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112
You talked about

842
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,672
I think it is Data normalization but that may be the wrong way.

843
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
Yeah that's basically

844
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,000
Your normalizing

845
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
You pick your standard

846
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:05,376
Nothing it's very important here to understand that this is not trying to Creighton

847
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,680
Talk about it

848
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,704
With people there like

849
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,008
Oh man you're solving the standards

850
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,056
Your fragmentation problem with another stand

851
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:16,640
No that's not that's not the goal here in the goal is to solve the problem with a

852
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Really sucks

853
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
That makes it all work together so that's that's

854
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,808
Generalization is basically

855
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,600
You know what that lower layer does

856
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,648
I can come to talk to you about a little bit

857
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
Go for it

858
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,464
We're at that spot you should talk through it

859
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
All right

860
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
Start at the bottom

861
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,536
So basically you have all these

862
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,608
Things that communicate over a variety of different standards

863
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,376
So

864
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,424
If I'm in a an existing

865
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,960
Situation at brownfields

866
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
Situation

867
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,032
I'm kinda told what protocol I need to talk

868
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,848
Maybe I'm in the building and I'm talking to bacnet

869
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
Ormond bus

870
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
You're the problem today going back to

871
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
The fragmentation problem

872
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,760
I mean there's literally if you left it a hundred different plots

873
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,528
Storms out there

874
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,576
They basically all right

875
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
At the application

876
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,648
The device interface

877
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,696
No for that particular bacnet

878
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
Thermostat

879
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,512
Where that particular modbus

880
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,560
Flow meter for note for the water

881
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,608
Be alright the drivers different

882
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,144
So even though modbus

883
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,912
The standard

884
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
At the Opera

885
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,216
Json layer

886
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,752
Kind of like your keyboard driver

887
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,288
Everyone treats a differently

888
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,592
Because I just kind of writing drivers to make it work

889
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,872
Just to get the data so then

890
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,896
Analytics

891
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,688
The platform

892
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
Really have a hundred different

893
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,528
Drivers for that modbus

894
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
Water phlegm

895
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,880
That's the fragmentation that makes it really hard to scale

896
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,904
So what are jets fans

897
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,232
Is it provides you a common way to write

898
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,000
Drivers

899
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
Devices

900
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,816
Is done through enough

901
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,400
BK for the device services and so each device service is a

902
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
The container

903
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,728
You can point through Docker or anime

904
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,288
Turn to snap you to play a service kind of like

905
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,056
The keyboard driver

906
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,080
It's done

907
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,360
You about the OS

908
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:56,991
But it's also agnostic that's another key part of this architecture is its platform-independent

909
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,271
Both in terms of

910
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
Hardware

911
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,599
So any CPU arm or x86

912
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,207
Even though we're doing it through the Linux Foundation of course it runs on Linux

913
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,279
Windows keep running on Macos

914
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,815
So that device servicenow

915
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,607
How can run on your choice of cyst

916
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,655
You write the driver once

917
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,191
4 using the SD

918
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
Hey

919
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,239
And now it works

920
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,799
With the core services in the edge X architecture

921
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
Common way

922
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
So I do not modbus

923
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,639
Driver once

924
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,943
I do the bacnet driver once for that

925
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,479
Device

926
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,271
And I can start to build a library

927
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
Consistent

928
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,087
And once that libraries

929
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,623
In all application

930
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,159
Topside

931
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,695
And use a common

932
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,463
What

933
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,071
And the chief for years that you get a bunch of companies involved and you put it through open sores

934
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
So that

935
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:49,727
There's a very consistent way and in terms of how these device drivers are so I can be back Matt and modbus

936
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,031
Zigbee temperature for energy

937
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,079
Gtt or some sort of

938
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,407
Coyote protocol any number of

939
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Choices

940
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,967
It could even be a proprietary

941
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
Standard

942
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,343
As long as you use the device service SDK to write in

943
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,367
Consistent format

944
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:09,183
Alfie the protocol support plasty

945
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,719
Metadata above that

946
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
Describes

947
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:15,583
The details of that particular device the core of the architecture knows how to talk to

948
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,863
Right it's like

949
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,399
Crowdsourcing the one ring

950
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
Everything can talk

951
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,959
Yeah

952
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,031
So the middle is the secret decoder ring

953
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,567
That allows you to

954
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,359
You talk to that. Devices

955
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,151
Okay

956
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,687
This is a Dell

957
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
Created

958
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,039
Project but it is open-sourced we talked

959
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:38,367
You were about to basically.

960
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,415
Hey we're doing

961
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,951
So what has the result

962
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511
At this point we've engaged with

963
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
Hundreds and hundreds

964
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,863
The companies that are interested in using this this code

965
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,655
As a foundation

966
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,679
Further

967
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,703
There is clots

968
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,775
You said they build a Gateway platform today

969
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
Even if you

970
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:00,639
You do those device interfaces today out of necessity to get the data

971
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,943
We have a lot of companies are like you know what

972
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
I'd rather

973
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
Drop what I've done

974
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,527
Necessity and use this

975
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,367
That's a Sunday since we've got lots and lots of companies are interested in doing that

976
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,463
And the other important thing is that there's a lot of companies that build things like

977
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,023
Complex event processing engine

978
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,071
For a Gateway for the edge Analytics

979
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,607
Security service

980
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,143
That can run at the edge

981
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:25,983
System management tools with backend console

982
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,055
Databases you any kind of value out around

983
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,847
The data ingestion

984
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,383
A lot of people are struggling to

985
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:36,479
There's no center of gravity to attach it to that that's kind of industry adopted

986
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:40,575
Unit in the tangible way and so that's why we're getting so much interest

987
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,855
Not only do we have

988
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,623
Hundreds of

989
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,975
You're when we launched the project last week

990
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,279
You we had right around 50

991
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,327
Your founding members for the project

992
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,607
Lots of people that want to

993
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,167
The code is amateurs and open source

994
00:44:55,423 --> 00:45:01,567
You'll never go from there so it's a big launching and we're looking forward to it now being you cannot truly 8/8

995
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,847
A community effort

996
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:07,199
I'm going from there you guys are signed up companies such as Google sap

997
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,223
And others

998
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,271
And what I'd like to know is

999
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,551
Why are they getting info

1000
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,367
Companies of all sizes

1001
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:19,487
Are really just looking for a way to focus their time on invaluable

1002
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,047
And so so rather than Reinventing

1003
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,815
You know

1004
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,863
For The Hundreds or so times

1005
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,167
A single type of device

1006
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,751
Let's all use a more common way of inner operating

1007
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,031
Sensors

1008
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
Systems

1009
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,871
And then let's go build value-add on top

1010
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,407
So those those types of companies

1011
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,943
I see it as a way to really

1012
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
You prioritize

1013
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
Timeout

1014
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
On the real value

1015
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,575
Your analytics and services and

1016
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:48,159
Security in system management tow companies

1017
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,439
A large like like

1018
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,231
You Google an SAT and

1019
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,791
Electric lighters like Chronicle

1020
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,351
We've got a smaller startup

1021
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,191
Doing really good stuff in it that it's actually built a lot of this time

1022
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,727
Kind of stopping their own platform

1023
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,055
It'd be much better use of my time to use a common

1024
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,615
Core and then focus on value so

1025
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,663
People like Kimi lacity and

1026
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,431
Henry layer

1027
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,967
Docker Networks

1028
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,039
Edge analytics company called foghorn

1029
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,599
Home security providers like no Kana

1030
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,135
Device Authority

1031
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
Forgerock

1032
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,719
All coming together

1033
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:23,999
Go to

1034
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,279
Add their value

1035
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,815
Around this common

1036
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,839
Foundation

1037
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
Got it

1038
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,911
And you kind of answered one of my questions was

1039
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,215
Which was about will this hurt others that have

1040
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,263
Really built a business around kind of

1041
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,823
Bringing all the stuff together and it sounds like

1042
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,127
Most of those companies would rather not

1043
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,455
Spend some of these extra things

1044
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,503
So let's talk about these extra things

1045
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,783
I think it's worthwhile

1046
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,319
You have a vision

1047
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,087
Where

1048
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:53,695
You got the score use the estoque and then various apis and you can plug like

1049
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
Your security

1050
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,535
Efforts and your data analytics what else can you

1051
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
Bring to the spa

1052
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,863
No system management so

1053
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,751
Example like I'm trying to manage a bunch of sensors yuan in their firmware updates

1054
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
Youku

1055
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:11,359
Connecting two gateways or just a network in general

1056
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,919
It's really different difficult to do because of

1057
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,943
Yours all those different

1058
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,759
Standard so this provides a center of gravity for those types

1059
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,807
Play I'm a database

1060
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,623
Provider and I offer like a time-series database

1061
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:26,719
You collect data on a Gateway and then I do it like a really good fashion

1062
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
Preston

1063
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,023
Oakley

1064
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:33,375
Send out the stuff that matters to my business and pay for it over the network

1065
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,167
Yeah you could be that type of swim-bladder

1066
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,959
We've even got company

1067
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,495
Interesting

1068
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,031
It's the so much value the

1069
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:40,799
We added

1070
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,823
Around the wheel

1071
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,895
Companies that are starting to

1072
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,919
You add

1073
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,711
Training services around it

1074
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,319
Your dad will be a certification program in the Linux foundation and we thought

1075
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,343
Your certification

1076
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,367
Houses

1077
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,903
Instant signing app

1078
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,951
I'm speaking about extension of

1079
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,231
Part of it

1080
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:02,047
Does a company is companies that do kind of logging

1081
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,607
Services for letting an 18 attached to it

1082
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,143
It's got a framework on

1083
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,703
On the top side of that. Interoperability layer

1084
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,263
Describes how data comes up and comes back down

1085
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,055
To those devices

1086
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,335
It's got a bunch of

1087
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,871
Place holders that are all reference

1088
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,431
They all communicate through exercising

1089
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
On the platform

1090
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,479
Your rules engine

1091
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,295
And there's a database in there it's mongodb

1092
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,623
Oh you don't like that database you can replace it with your own

1093
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,159
Does reference services

1094
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,951
Give you something that works out of the box

1095
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,743
But all these different types of

1096
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,511
It providers

1097
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,535
Can

1098
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,327
Commercialize their versions

1099
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,631
News about the platform in their plugin

1100
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,167
Alternates that they sell

1101
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471
Okay and then

1102
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:46,591
How does this fit in with some of the other efforts out there like there's project quora

1103
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,895
From the eclipse Foundation

1104
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:53,247
I don't know if some of the other kind of standards are going to try to get into here

1105
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,527
There's kind of some

1106
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:58,111
Reference architecture efforts for The Internet of Things Consortium

1107
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,951
So how does this fit in with that kind of wider ecosystem of trying to make the world

1108
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,023
Yeah so we

1109
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
Yeah that was that's part of the

1110
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:10,655
Alignment that we've been working on all this time over the past

1111
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,959
A few years that we've been building the project is

1112
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:17,055
I don't want to reinvent standards there's plenty of really good standards

1113
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,079
No we don't want to

1114
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:22,431
Dell New Consortium like where we want to align with them the Kura project we've been

1115
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,967
Indirect contact with

1116
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
Eclipse Foundation

1117
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,783
It is overlapped

1118
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,319
I was Sakura project

1119
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:31,391
We seriously consider joining prayer with think it's a great project

1120
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:37,023
We saw the market needed something that had a little bit more flexibility in terms of being Loosely coupled

1121
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,559
Your polyglot I eat

1122
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:44,191
It's not just Java you can run all these different code bases together which is important when you're trying to unify partners

1123
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,495
Developers cuz they all have different preferences

1124
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
That's why I

1125
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
What's the different architecture

1126
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,639
But actually you could take a career based Gateway and plug it into a jack

1127
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:55,199
Infina K10 you can have a service that.

1128
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,015
Gateway to Gateway so you actually think that they

1129
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,087
Play some good collaboration potential with a variety of different

1130
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,879
You open source projects that is

1131
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,463
Solving similar needs in different ways

1132
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:12,863
In terms of Standards we've already got folks like you Ellie and notion signed up for working

1133
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:19,263
Foundation on a on a liaison agreement there so if you're in manufacturing opc-ua is a very important

1134
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,823
That we want to promote

1135
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:22,847
Call ideas

1136
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,383
Use good standards

1137
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,919
You know if you don't have an opinion

1138
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:29,759
But if you have to use something at least use a common way to write to it

1139
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
Talk to it

1140
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,831
So and we're working on

1141
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:39,231
Just invited to Malaysia open connectivity Foundation we're building a liaison agreement

1142
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:39,999
We've been

1143
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,535
You working with IC

1144
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,583
Two same thing

1145
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,119
About the liaison agreement

1146
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:51,519
I actually last week when we are there we showed the edge x one of the demos was part of an iic security test bed

1147
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,567
Bunch of people at participating

1148
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,359
Open fog Consortium

1149
00:50:55,615 --> 00:51:01,759
If you read the reference architecture that was put out recently it's actually very similar to an infant

1150
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
A lot of the elements

1151
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,087
To the edge X Andre architecture

1152
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,671
Yes we were founding member of openfox or working with a bunch of different

1153
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Shapewear

1154
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:16,863
Edgex Foundry can be used as an ingredient in open smog test pek

1155
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,655
We've really been trying to

1156
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:23,007
Bridge to all these different efforts

1157
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,567
And we get this kind of PC model

1158
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,335
4

1159
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,383
Industrial internet-of-things are just

1160
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
Internet of Things

1161
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,223
How much time do you think this could save

1162
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,759
People trying to

1163
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:34,527
Implement

1164
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,599
Connected battery is connected hospitals connected

1165
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:44,255
Yeah minutes time-factor there's also a security Factory with you not going to talk to a couple things but you just in terms of time

1166
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:47,327
And I'm going to start by saying imagine if

1167
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,399
If 50% of the brain power give or take wasn't

1168
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,727
You focus on reinvention today in the market writing device service

1169
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:58,335
If you need to write new protocol support I can take weeks to months to do it

1170
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,639
You depending on what platform you are working in

1171
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,663
Some of the best

1172
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,711
Glassdoor the proprietary platform

1173
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:07,295
Once you know a little bit about a protocol you can do it very quickly

1174
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
So

1175
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,855
You know it's not like it's saving you.

1176
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:13,183
Time for say you compared to maybe the best in class

1177
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,463
Silent protocol

1178
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,023
But I have to redo it for every pot for

1179
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
Form out there

1180
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:21,887
Hear it saves time because once I do a device service I can reuse it

1181
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,703
With anybody's application on the back end so maybe I want to

1182
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,983
Connect to

1183
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:31,103
Your thing works in a deal in one case and then I went to connect to sap Hana

1184
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,687
You know or or IBM Watson or relayer or

1185
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,759
Any laxity any number of different providers

1186
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,807
I can do the work once

1187
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,111
Are the prime factors is

1188
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,135
You way better

1189
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,671
Everything is just

1190
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,207
Trying to sell

1191
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,743
It takes a lot of

1192
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,023
Time to sell

1193
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,047
Embedded Solutions

1194
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,631
And the challenge today is when customers look at the market they're like

1195
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,423
Man there's a lot of platform

1196
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:58,239
Literally search you iot platform

1197
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
Google

1198
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,055
Incredible number of

1199
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,895
A lot of people adding a lot of value but also a lot of reinvention

1200
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,711
Fuses Customer Center

1201
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,991
Time to revenue

1202
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,783
Customers are like

1203
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:16,671
I don't know if I want to make the wrong decision especially at the edge where you have to update it

1204
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,951
Because I made a mistake on my

1205
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,743
I'm rolling a truck out there today

1206
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,767
Will fix it

1207
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:23,839
Should I said

1208
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
And everything

1209
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,399
This time on development

1210
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,679
Time to revenue

1211
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:30,495
Not only because of the it on the time but also because of the

1212
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,031
Decision time for customers

1213
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,591
You're not looking at so many choices

1214
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,127
That are very confusing

1215
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,687
Did the security side to you very important

1216
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,479
I would argue that

1217
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,015
Impossible to really

1218
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
Shell

1219
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:47,135
You like smart city solutions or anything that kind of crosses public and private boundaries

1220
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,671
Or even

1221
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,439
Private surprise

1222
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,231
Businesses sharing data

1223
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:53,023
Without some sort of

1224
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,583
Trusted openkore that everyone

1225
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,119
And take a look at

1226
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,399
Everyone

1227
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,727
Godzilla Security Administration pass

1228
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,519
And also if you're trying to share data between

1229
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,543
Three different companies

1230
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,591
Difference a public and private entities

1231
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,383
Having that open Trust

1232
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,919
Corvette

1233
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,735
Exchanges data between things and applications

1234
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:15,295
It is really important that we think it'll actually help

1235
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,319
You there as well

1236
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,367
Ip true internet

1237
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,439
We always dress start

1238
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,719
With your your things

1239
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,279
Start with with a small and a domain

1240
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:29,631
And then it'll be like a series of increasingly larger Intranet

1241
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:35,519
You saying everything's going to talk with everything is probably a bit of a misnomer but you're having that open crust and core

1242
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,919
I love it I never thought I could spend so much time talking about drivers

1243
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:44,735
I can keep going

1244
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
You

1245
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,063
I've done a great job Jason

1246
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
Thank you so much for

1247
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,111
For coming on the show

1248
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:57,279
Thanks for having me at this might either well that's it for another episode of The Internet of Things podcast

1249
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:03,679
Please join us next week when we have another amazing show for you and if in the meantime you are

1250
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:10,335
Hankering for some iot news sign up for my newsletter it's Stacey on iot. Com

1251
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:16,735
Thanks for listening
