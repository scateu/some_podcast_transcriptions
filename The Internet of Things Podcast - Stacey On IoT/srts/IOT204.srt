Consumer-oriented news but we may talk a little bit about it in the industrial space coast

23
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,336
Why the heck not

24
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,384

Kevin

65
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,456
Let's get this started with

66
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
Apple

67
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,016
Yay

68
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,576
Some exciting news that's been coming dribbling out

69
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,880
The last well feet look like

70
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
For a while but in the last week

71
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,488
Week or so we saw a couple of news announcer

72
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,280
It's one was that Sam

73
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,840
Jadallah who was actually the founder of

74
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
Be Auto Smart

75
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
I don't know if

76
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
You guys remember I definitely talk

77
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,240
It was a $700

78
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
Connected locks

79
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
It came out

80
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
All maybe a year

81
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,384
2 years ago is hugely expensive very pretty

82
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
Very substantial but Doom

83
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
And then

84
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
So he's going to work it out

85
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,272
Apple now in there

86
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
Home division

87
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,088
What also is ham

88
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
John giannandrea

89
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
Has been promoted to the execu

90
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
And

91
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
They also pushed out series voices

92
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
Jan Andreas

93
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Come to Apple

94
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Calls from Google

95
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,424
And he was in charge of some of their AI

96
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
People

97
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
Believe

98
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
Help AppleCare

99
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776
Gain some ground

100
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
Because for a while

101
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,336
If not been awesome

102
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
Jean Andrea was

103
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,176
Google Drive machine learning

104
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,712
Now he's apples SBP

105
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,760
Key of machine learning and AI strategy

106
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
He reports directly to 10

107
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
Tim Cook that was a change that happened

108
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,160
And so basically what we're seeing is the elevation at app

109
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
Of AI and machine

110
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
To be a more critic

111
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,584
Which is much later than its competitors I would say

112
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
Yes so

113
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Also

114
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
Apple just

115
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
Pull string technology

116
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Which

117
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
Used to be a company called

118
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
Boy talk

119
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
Wispies for her

120
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
Pixar Executives whenever I think

121
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Pixar I have

122
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
There's synergies there there

123
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
Executive back

124
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,040
Fourth I think Toy Story but okay

125
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Yes okay

126
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
But

127
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,136
Toytalk what they did

128
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,184
And what pull string does is

129
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,000
The idea was to create a compelling narrative

130
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
A voice generated narrative

131
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
Around in a relationship

132
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
So it was designed

133
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
Orchids initially

134
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,240
And they were going to build basically toys

135
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
License search

136
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,032
Technology to Twin maker

137
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,848
So kids could create a relationship

138
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
Around

139
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Barbie

140
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
Aurora Disney character toy or whatever

141
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,224
And they did do that

142
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,040
That is true

143
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,624
Write that hello Barbie doll is you know power bi

144
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
Clustering technology

145
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
So with all this everyone's like

146
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
Apples moving beyond the knife

147
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
Which makes sense

148
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
Here's what I think is

149
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
I think Apple

150
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
Pause moving beyond the eye

151
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
IPhone into

152
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,935
And there's a couple reasons I thing

153
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
One apple has said

154
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
Hookah said that health

155
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
Where will be the biggest thing

156
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
Apple has to offer Humanity

157
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,895
What Apple has bought a succession of companies

158
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
Give medical quality

159
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,247
You see it with the Apple watch

160
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
And

161
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,831
Since Apple was never really awesome at the

162
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
Cloud

163
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
And critic services

164
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,743
I think this is an area where it can take things that were a weakness and turn them into a straw

165
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
Apple's data privacy

166
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
That is basically it hurting

167
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
It's bugs into a feature that

168
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
But it's actually really good feature

169
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
And I have talked about this

170
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
So there's that ass

171
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591
But there's a lot of pets showing Apple doing so cool

172
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
Eggs and I think

173
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,175
If you pull all of that together

174
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
When I talk to doctors

175
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
About telemedicine and

176
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
And home health monitor

177
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Coyote

178
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Etsy need a couple

179
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,951
You need reproducibility and Trust in the actual data underlying

180
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
This device

181
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
So you have to know the

182
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
This is not

183
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Digital snake

184
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,839
Right you have to know this is a real

185
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,399
Possible benefit in this has to be proven and tested

186
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
Apple will take

187
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
We seen it already with their efforts

188
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
For the Apple watch and afib it's things like

189
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Like that

190
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
2

191
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,919
The products have to be easy to use doctors cannot

192
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Tell

193
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,479
A 60 year old

194
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
Percent

195
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Go home

196
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,807
And by this connected to Bluetooth

197
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
Like it is hard

198
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,623
For someone to get like

199
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
A connected blood

200
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,975
Okay that is actually for many of our listeners

201
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
It's pretty easy to set up

202
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
That's actually not easy

203
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
Is there any product in the medical

204
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
Well has to be easy to

205
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
Use apple is wonderful

206
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
3

207
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,031
Medical technology has historically been scared

208
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
It's felt like

209
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
Analogy but if you

210
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Apple's history

211
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
With

212
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,735
The iPhone and making technology approachable and you think about things like

213
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
Buying

214
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Pull string

215
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
And some of their other

216
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Positions

217
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,391
Baked make technology very warm

218
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
And friendly

219
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,207
In their medical devices which will make

220
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
People want to use it

221
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,535
I think of Apple in medical

222
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
I think it's something like I don't know if you

223
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
Remember I saw the master of none

224
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Episode

225
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
Japanese robotic seal

226
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
Do you know what I'm talking about Kevin

227
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
I didn't say it

228
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Sorry

229
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
The sea was called

230
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Pero it's

231
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Therapeutic

232
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Baby robot

233
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Seal for old

234
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
It was so funny because

235
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
In the show is like

236
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
What the heck is this

237
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
And then by the end

238
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
I love it

239
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
I love it

240
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
Ico

241
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Applebee near

242
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
To do something

243
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,303
Not necessarily a robotic baby seal that old people

244
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
Love being able to create a product

245
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
It is imbued with technology

246
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
The people want to

247
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Hold

248
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
Want to sleep with

249
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,031
Want to bring into their everyday lives

250
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
It haven't

251
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
Gather this data

252
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
Make sense of it

253
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,967
Forest actually invisible to the user meaning

254
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:21,599
ECG in the watch that you never see or in airpod 2

255
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
Headphones that we expect later this year to have

256
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
Health sensors and such that

257
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
You never know

258
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
Exactly so I think

259
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
And

260
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
Here's the other reason

261
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
This is a good place for

262
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
Medical technology

263
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
Not just stupid Wellness

264
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
Pieology like me and my Fitbit which I love

265
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
But that's not a sin

266
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Right

267
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
Apple goes after

268
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Essential

269
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,407
Munchies and if you think about music

270
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
Music was an essential

271
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967
Technology that drove

272
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
Creation of iPod

273
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
And then

274
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
Was filtered into the eye

275
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
ITunes was a

276
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,879
Huge moneymaker for Apple

277
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
They recognized

278
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,999
What's essential in honestly the way that

279
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
I love them but

280
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,607
The way that voice services in the home that digital speakers are playing out

281
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
If you'll still more like a

282
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
Send something essential

283
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
So I understand why Apple

284
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Feel like almost like

285
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,591
Ask the homepod out there as part of their music app

286
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
Throw that out there to make Wall Street happy

287
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,759
We got a digital speaker I don't care while they focus on something

288
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
This real

289
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
It is actually going to be

290
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,367
Healthcare is a huge industry

291
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:31,743
So I agree with everything you said but I actually want to expand the pond one early point

292
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,815
Where you said they were turning a weakness into a strength

293
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,375
Which I agree with that there's another weakness here

294
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
That they're leveraging even more

295
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,031
We know they're terrible at Cloud by comparison to a Google a Microsoft

296
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
A Amazon

297
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
So they can't get data

298
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:53,247
They get their data from devices and apps in their ecosystem and that's it where is others

299
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,319
Get data from the web which everybody uses

300
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
Apple doesn't have that

301
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,695
A safari a search engine that is

302
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
Huge huge gap

303
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:08,607
So what do they do they go out to their Edge devices the People by gather useful information

304
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:14,751
In your case you're making a case out of health information and I wholeheartedly agree because I have not yet found a better

305
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
Health

306
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,823
Wearable ecosystem then

307
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,639
Apple health and my Apple watch quite honestly

308
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
So

309
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
That is another

310
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,247
Weakness that are like unicorn

311
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
Competing with these guys in the cloud

312
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
So how do we get data at the user level

313
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
Some other way and what day do we

314
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
Specifically

315
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
And it's help

316
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,279
So I agree with you 100% so that's where I think

317
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
If we look at like

318
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,095
Hey what's Apple doing after the iPhone

319
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
I think it will be some sort of

320
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Consumer

321
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
Oriented

322
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
Medical grade

323
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
Device

324
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
That helps

325
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Doctors

326
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
And loved one

327
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
Take care of people in the home

328
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
Water enhancer health

329
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
And I say that because

330
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:01,343
There's every possibility that Apple could come out with its own quote unquote hearing aid with airpods wireless hearing

331
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,231
Maybe it's a true hearing aid or maybe it's a personal sound amplifier system which is 9 ft

332
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
Approved

333
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,583
And it's affordable it works its cortical magical and

334
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
They enhance somebody's life

335
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
So that's where

336
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
That's where that's at

337
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Isaac

338
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
Feel free to argue

339
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,895
West Freeway alright so moving on to something

340
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
We'll see where this goes

341
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,783
Linden Tibbets who is the CEO and co-founder of if

342
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
I talked to him

343
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
A decade ago

344
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,647
About what he was trying to do here so

345
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
You step down

346
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
And

347
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
They brought in Chris

348
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,559
Kabardian who is most recently the CEO of monster.com

349
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
To take over the sea

350
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
So Tibbetts will stay on as if

351
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
Chief designer

352
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
Officer in

353
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,031
Oriana is described as a turnaround special

354
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
This isn't

355
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
Surprising

356
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,431
It is been really like when it started if

357
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
With

358
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
A wonderful

359
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,783
Vision his vision was to basically

360
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Create

361
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
A way to interact with

362
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
With digital objects

363
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
The same way

364
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
We would interact

365
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
So

366
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,303
His example to me was you know if you have a coffee

367
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Upon your

368
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Desk

369
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
You can use it as a

370
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
You can use it as a pencil holder

371
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
You can use it as a paperweight but

372
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,567
In the physical world you see something and you have all these ideas for how you

373
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
Manipulate

374
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Use it

375
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
Whose idea was to create a plateau

376
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
That allowed you to do that

377
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Digital

378
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
So you can

379
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
Take something that was intended

380
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Something else

381
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
Adapter to

382
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
Beach

383
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
I love

384
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:44,511
No it's a great idea and what they've done is they've gathered up all these API some of these device makers

385
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,351
And made it simple to you so that you want to be a programmer

386
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,447
Create a different program for every little thing you want to do

387
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:58,079
Do very simple trigger events and action on everything happens in the back in the cloud

388
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
I love it

389
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:05,247
I'm just wondering I was nothing anybody could see this but when you mentioned that kabardian is a turnaround specialist I had my eye

390
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
Eyebrow raise because

391
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
I just wonder

392
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
Passion

393
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
Financial standpoint

394
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
How does

395
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:17,535
If really continue on is it making its money

396
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
So if two makes

397
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,351
It's money from companies

398
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Like

399
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Apple

400
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
Amazon

401
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
More Samsung or

402
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
Whirlpool

403
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
Those companies

404
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Can create

405
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
Supported apis basically

406
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,431
And they put them on the platform if charges them to

407
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
Manage that and then they can also get data about

408
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
Like what people are using

409
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
But

410
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,391
It's been pretty hard and like I don't know if he'll remember this but when

411
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Chamberlain

412
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
The creator of the MyQ garage door open

413
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,023
Pronounce there if Channel they actually said they would charge

414
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
People a dollar

415
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,399
And what are the reasons was

416
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
You know it's charging them

417
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,983
They want people to really want to use it

418
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
People were upset but

419
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:04,127
Yeah understandably so cuz they're so used to just using it for

420
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
Free

421
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,223
Number to so it seems like a

422
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
Pei Wei

423
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
Kind of service

424
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
Taipei I mean the hardware makers

425
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
No

426
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,695
At some point what if they start pulling out in providing their own

427
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
No

428
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,559
Apps and services in so long I just worry I just don't

429
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,583
I love if

430
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,631
Business perspective I just

431
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Question

432
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
How They Roll

433
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,703
Make money I just

434
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
?

435
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
Yeah well in

436
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
I think they have

437
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
A decent

438
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
Revenue strata

439
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
I just think

440
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
It's hard to get

441
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
Users in

442
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
People to pay

443
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:44,831
Pay for it and it may be a mismatch between the Venture model and what it can actually legit

444
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
So

445
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
Will also see there

446
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,207
So they do just raise money last year

447
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,023
There is 24 million yes

448
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
A little higher so gay

449
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
According to TechCrunch

450
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,655
Yeah this is one of those areas where I'm not going to

451
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,727
Wholesale freaked out like I know it's going away but

452
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
I could see you like in six months if

453
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,079
This guy is not gaining more traction week

454
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
I could see if

455
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
Put on the market

456
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
And it'll be

457
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
It's a great plan

458
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
A lots of come

459
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,295
Company so it would be interesting to see who might buy it

460
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,367
How that would change that mean one of the advantages of

461
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
Left is that it is not owned

462
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
Right right

463
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:28,351
If I had to place a gas and we'll talk about this whole bit more but I would say

464
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
Google would be my number one

465
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,935
To pick it up if it weren't for sale

466
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,543
There's a reason I'm saying

467
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
Spoiler alert you guys

468
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Okay

469
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,199
So let's talk about somebody else that's

470
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Osram

471
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
Which you guys

472
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,807
I mean I know but they are a lie

473
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Lightning

474
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
LEDs

475
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
Yes they have the lightify play

476
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,511
Apartments with their platform was

477
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,071
This is been you know in the lightbulb world

478
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
The lightbulb world

479
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
Spin-outs

480
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
A positions

481
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
It's a tough Market

482
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Because

483
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
LED shift suddenly

484
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Something that you

485
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
You might buy

486
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,895
Multiple light bulbs per year and now you're going to replace them with LEDs and

487
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Not buy anymore

488
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
Technology

489
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
Needs us to switch our business model

490
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
Also everyone was like services

491
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Gnarly

492
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
So

493
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,231
Has confirmed that is it acquisition candidate

494
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
And

495
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
They're talking to Bain Capital and

496
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Carlyle Group

497
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,631
This is really tough for letting folks

498
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
That's the story about Ozzy

499
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,471
Maybe it'll go the way of signify

500
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
Jennifer Phillips

501
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Which Phillip spun out at

502
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
Light bulb

503
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,335
What division including the Philips Hue bulbs into a compass

504
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Call signify

505
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
GE

506
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
It's been out there like

507
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Lighting division

508
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
So who knows

509
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
We'll see what happens

510
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
And oh yeah

511
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Lifx

512
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
Was just acquired by

513
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
Buddy platform

514
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
Which is a smart phone says

515
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
Crazy times for lighting

516
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Already

517
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
Let's talk about this story

518
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,583
Couple weeks ago nest

519
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
Basically said hey

520
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,935
You can now use Google assistant on your nest secure system

521
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,495
And specifically The Nest guard

522
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,591
You have to opt-in because of your going to activate a microphone on this particular.

523
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
Weight has a microphone

524
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,919
What I know

525
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,479
So that's kind of how the world felt about this

526
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
They're like

527
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Didn't talk about that

528
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
And

529
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
We talked about that on that beat

530
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,879
Regular Show and then last week we talked about it

531
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,951
With regards to smart televisions because we went looking for

532
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
Privacy-related

533
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
Hunt around smart televisions

534
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
And we discovered that

535
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,631
It was unclear if certain TVs have microphones in the mirror.

536
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
Which we thought was kind of like

537
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,959
Not great

538
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,359
List the stuff in the specs before customers even purchases are they don't want to find out afterwards

539
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
Exactly and so

540
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
Business Insider

541
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
Kudos to them

542
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Calling them out

543
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,015
They sent a media request to

544
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Google

545
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
And basically was like

546
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,623
How come you never told anybody that the resume

547
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
And

548
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,535
The response I got back was beyond device microphone was never intended to be a secret and should have been listed in the text

549
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
That was an error

550
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
Yes Bank

551
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
So

552
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:15,519
It's just like the conversation we had about Smart TVs if you're going to have microphones cameras Etc

553
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
It's all good

554
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Upfront

555
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,151
Fun Center so that people know what they're buying before they buy it

556
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,711
Which leads me to this week's newsletter

557
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:28,063
I am going to write about what I feel like the ideal truth in labeling laws

558
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
Buffer

559
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,367
Iot devices

560
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,903
In what sort of things should be

561
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
Be covered in

562
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
A company who selling a

563
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
What sort of

564
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
Things that

565
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
Include as part of that

566
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:44,447
We've talked about some of those things but it seems like every several months end up adding something new to the list

567
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
Yeah we're like oh

568
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
Obvious but I guess it wasn't

569
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
All right and as we learn

570
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Think so

571
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,919
I'm sure this will change gilfry

572
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
If you hear this before

573
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
You know the end of the day Thursday UK

574
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,087
Tweet at me your suggestions of things that should be in there maybe

575
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
Maybe they'll make it Millis

576
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
So let's talk about

577
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
Smart circuit breaker

578
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,791
Leviton has announced

579
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
At the international

580
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
Builder show a

581
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
Connected smart circuit breaker

582
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
The ties back to their device

583
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
This is

584
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
A really cool device

585
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
People are very

586
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
Excited about it

587
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
I just want to say

588
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,103
But this is not the first one at the

589
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
Schneider Electric india

590
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
Both big makers of those panel boxes outside your home

591
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Both have

592
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,271
Is most of them

593
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,063
They're targeted at the industrial space

594
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,343
So this is at the home

595
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,415
In the whole Market there's actually a large number of

596
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,975
Products the try to do energy monitoring

597
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
For you

598
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,535
Either at the circuit box

599
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
Which is complex and

600
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,375
A pain in the butt to install or maybe at

601
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
The plug level

602
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
And some of them just clip onto wires in light

603
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,495
Like say that they can manage all of this stuff

604
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
Distinguish different

605
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,079
Devices based on their electrical signature

606
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
So

607
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
Is a rich history

608
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
But

609
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
Historically this hasn't

610
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,551
Yeah that there is a rich history of this but I think it's been very

611
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,439
It's been focused xiao-nan consumer applications and the consumer applications

612
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
Where products have

613
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
Come out for this

614
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,815
Have been from startup since I should I think this is probably the first

615
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,863
Big name that I can think of

616
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
Going after the consumer here

617
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
I think that's going to be a huge

618
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,495
Benefit I also think

619
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,079
You can't just have a smart circuit breaker be expect to

620
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:32,479
Everything go hunky-dory you need a platform that works with a Leviton has that well over the range for the product

621
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,295
So I got the shot

622
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,855
To succeed where others have not been so successful

623
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,927
My question is how much does it cost

624
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
Don't know yet we don't know

625
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,511
It'll be available in the second quarter of

626
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
2019

627
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
So

628
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,839
Well presumably find out then

629
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,655
Historically when I have tried these devices out

630
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
I have come to

631
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
To the realization

632
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
That

633
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
They don't help

634
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,335
I was going to say what you really get out of it other than some cool data

635
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,383
So you get this awesome data and you're like

636
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
Hot diggity

637
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
And there are some Lo hang

638
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,039
Rate so you may see a space heater that you like

639
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,855
Wrap it is way cheaper to

640
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,183
Keep my entire house did using this energy does a space heater

641
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
So there may be things like

642
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
After you switch all your light bill

643
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
Is after you eliminate the

644
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
Space heater

645
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
You're left with things that

646
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
Yeah like they're hot

647
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
So

648
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,775
One of the advantages his you know what I'd like to see

649
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,311
Is more integration but

650
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
Between some of the

651
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
These

652
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
Companies that produce like

653
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,943
Meme for example which makes hot water heater

654
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,223
If they can make

655
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,759
Come up with an app that takes a

656
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
Advantage of levittown's

657
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
In a circuit

658
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
Breaker

659
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,879
An automatically like

660
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,927
Lower the temperature when it seems likely

661
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,951
Not be needed

662
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
There are companies that actually do

663
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
Right now

664
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
Or Whirlpool takes advantage to say

665
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
Like when I want to start

666
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
My dryer it's

667
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
Says hey by the way

668
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,215
We're in this kind of demand response situation don't

669
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,519
Yeah can you wait 30 minutes

670
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
There's some

671
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,103
Options but those options for lion

672
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
A lot of integration

673
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
They rely on

674
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
The idea that the consumer is

675
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Is going to watch

676
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
Want some sort of

677
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,039
Demand response

678
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
I don't know if we're there yet

679
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,879
I agree that don't bother for there yet

680
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,768
I was just going to go there cuz you talk about it like at the micro-level at the macro-level this could fit in nicely with

681
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
Can we talk about 3 weeks ago about

682
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,400
You know the possibility of Amazon indoor Google sort of the kitty more to the

683
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:32,800
Energy utility Space by capturing all the data and suggesting the people Your Nest right now

684
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,360
You can save on energy because we're at

685
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Stoller

686
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
Clips

687
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:50,720
Right right a tree cool and therefore they can spend as much in overtime and it's a bike 700

688
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,000
Megawatts of Power by the

689
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,536
Several thousand people that were

690
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,328
No pulled into this test

691
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,400
So I think it's more of a macro benefit

692
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,936
None of micro benefit butt

693
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,520
And I do think this is

694
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,056
Where the industry is going

695
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,104
I just don't know there's always the

696
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
The problem

697
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,456
You may have the right idea but you just have it too early

698
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,272
So it may be the start us were all too early in

699
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,344
The ecosystem is now going to come together around this but

700
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
I will say

701
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,440
Beecosystem does still need to come together around this for this product

702
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
Yep all right

703
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
So what's up

704
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
Ecosystem

705
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,840
Libelium which is what

706
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
The first iot

707
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
Companies I think I've

708
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
Ever

709
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
Dealt with

710
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,960
They are a European

711
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
And the

712
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,288
Basically started out

713
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
Like these things called

714
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Wasp

715
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,128
Boats they were little Laura based

716
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,200
Networks it was a sensor Network for agriculture

717
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
Smart cities for whatever

718
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
And

719
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,088
They just announced a partnership with Ericsson that is going to

720
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
To provide

721
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,648
Nb-iot

722
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,208
Modules that will work with the light Valium

723
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Ecosystem

724
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
So

725
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
This actually reminds me

726
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Very much

727
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,656
Of kind of shift that sigfox was making around

728
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
Open sourcing its Network

729
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,032
Just because these are all low power wide area in it

730
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
Providers

731
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,616
And we're basically seeing them try.

732
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,176
Established Solutions

733
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,992
Customers we understand this let's broaden

734
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,784
The number of radios we support

735
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,832
I'll get more people in here

736
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
So

737
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
We can basically build a business

738
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,696
Yeah and what they're doing in there

739
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,000
Starting out with a developer module leaking

740
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
Purchase

741
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:35,168
NBI Ortiz you said LTE cat M and some older GPRS Network skip

742
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
Just in case

743
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
There's no nb-iot coverage so

744
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,800
So this is just

745
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:45,408
It's a little piece of news but I think it's indicative of kind of an opening up in the

746
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
Low-power wide area

747
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
Hbase cell

748
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
Okay

749
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
Talk about

750
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Google

751
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
And

752
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
It's plans

753
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:58,208
Against madhumeh and I think this is why you think they might want to buy

754
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,000
Or they'd be likely to buy

755
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,816
Yes assuming if twere

756
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,608
Note to go on sale yes I do

757
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Google

758
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,424
Jumping in there and the reason being

759
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,728
And I didn't even know about the X news when I have the spot

760
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,312
I saw some figures over at search engine land

761
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,592
Couple days ago

762
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,872
And

763
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,152
What is the number of

764
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:21,504
Google actions in the US versus the number of skills for matinee

765
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
And

766
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,832
It's insane what a difference there is

767
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,160
There are roughly 60000 skills format of a as of

768
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
January

769
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,256
Emily 4253 Google actions

770
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,304
That is ridiculous

771
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,704
I know Google is competing better in the hardware side they're selling more Google devices

772
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,544
Desales I would suspect reduced pricing

773
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,944
It doesn't matter if you can do more with the Madam a on your own and

774
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
Even though I use Google home

775
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,272
For more than I use

776
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
Madam a

777
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,856
There's a huge difference between the apps or both

778
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,416
And it's so easy to find skills

779
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
For your Echo

780
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:07,840
On your phone of course you can stop

781
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,888
That's at the discovery is

782
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Very good

783
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,192
Not so with Google

784
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,520
I can't even find in the app where you would enable or

785
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:20,384
Look for actions because there is no way to do it that I know of I went through every menu like a fine

786
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
You have to go to

787
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,248
And I knew anybody from there as well

788
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,600
So that's a problem Discovery is just not even there

789
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
Not on the phone anyway

790
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,672
The other big thing is

791
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,464
I started working at the

792
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,792
Google developer blog versus the Amazon developer blogs

793
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,584
And there's a dedicated one

794
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
Format Ma

795
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:47,776
Refer to it many times in the show because there's always something to talk about there's always

796
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
Blueprints

797
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
Here's an easy way to create a skill

798
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,872
There's just a lot of

799
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:58,528
What's a hand-holding but a lot of direction for both developers and non developers to make skills

800
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,368
Google there's just one developer blog and I went through every

801
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,184
Post friend

802
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,720
That has to do with

803
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,512
Google what's this interaction

804
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,792
It's just not

805
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
They're not telling it enough

806
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,120
And they're not making it easy enough

807
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,400
This is classic

808
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,704
Google this is what Google does

809
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,752
They're like we have been vented some

810
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
Something amazing

811
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
We'll throw it over the wall

812
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,360
And if anyone wants to pick it up

813
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,152
You should developers will come

814
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,176
Yeah and that's

815
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,480
You cannot have best

816
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,504
Coolest thing

817
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,040
But people will not show up

818
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,088
They don't know about it or they can't

819
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,648
Even if they see it people are so busy

820
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,672
Developers

821
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,976
Normal people were all like inundated

822
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,792
Carnation if you don't tell us why it matters

823
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
It's not going to matter

824
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:47,680
Yeah and I'm not sure that's what I'm going to be so you can

825
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,264
Buy or pay the developer for Madame a skill

826
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,336
I don't know if you can do that with an action on Google

827
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,384
If you can't I don't know for sure

828
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
If you can't

829
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,200
What's a Development Center

830
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
Well

831
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
Yeah

832
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,624
Well you're on a cool voice platform but Google isn't

833
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
Google Voice platform

834
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
There was actually

835
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
Think strategy Analytics

836
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,512
Just put out numbers saying that

837
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,560
Their Q4 smart speaker

838
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096
Shipment screw 95

839
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Percent about 38

840
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,680
5 million units and

841
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
Amazon

842
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
Amazon was by far the winner

843
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,896
Yeah let me Google sketching up on the hardware side but it doesn't matter if

844
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:35,296
Now the skills they are actions aren't there or discoverable I can just limited utility people get bored with the same old same old

845
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:41,440
The functionality I think there's far more in creating new functionality just out of the

846
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,256
Language translation for conversations on the

847
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,024
Smart display

848
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,816
And it's fantastic

849
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,120
I can't keep inventing everything there

850
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
Yeah and

851
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
They have been some really cool stuff

852
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
But implementing it

853
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
That's where they fall down like

854
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
I mean I've had so many issues with

855
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,592
That I'm just like

856
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,688
I think you hit the nail on the head it's typical Google

857
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:09,088
To just say we'll just make that some people

858
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Do that anymore

859
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,392
Not if they really want to get

860
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
Consumers

861
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
In this case

862
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
They're not free

863
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
Right

864
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,792
It's one thing to be like I will give you an awesome Gmail Prada

865
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,864
Free cuz he knows something people understood at the time

866
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,800
Whole new functionality whole new type of product and people don't know what to do with it

867
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
Including developer

868
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,360
Okay

869
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
I agree with you Kevin

870
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Already

871
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
Well

872
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,968
We have covered a lot there's probably

873
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,016
There is definitely more we could cover

874
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,576
We're going to stop here and move to Riot

875
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
D podcast

876
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
We have this week's voicemail

877
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,440

Afero provides a proven iot platform

885
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
It doesn't

886
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,336
Affero customers have experienced as much as an

887
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,920

905
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,664
I love the show

906
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
Long time listener

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
I have

Yeah and I have lots

911
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
SmartThings

912
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,160
We are Amazon Alexa

913
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
We have

Github insteon hub

917
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,816
But I need a

918
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,840
Hammock

919
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,424
Something that I can program

920
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,728
Come around the house

921
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,264
She has an issue if she has a

922
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
Enable alert

923
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,408
Ferguson either a text or email to a

00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
User-configurable

925
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,992
DIY

926
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
Suggestion

927
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,088
But I've had a hard time finding anything

928
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Hope you can help

929
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
Thanks for the show

930
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
Wow John Deere home sounds like my hoe

931
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
A lot of hops

932
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
Lots of hugs

933
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
So we got options

934
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,400
But my favorite option

935
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,936
Probably the easiest one.

936
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,984
It's going to be from smart

937
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,288
Thanks and provided it stays up

938
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,824
Which it's gotten much better

939
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
Historically

940
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,640
This should be good for you

941
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,664
Cuz you can buy

942
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,224
A little you can basically do this with a zigbee or Z-Wave

943
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
What you're going to do is

944
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,832
You would use the smart

945
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,856
Apps in smart

946
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
Things

947
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
And

948
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,952
Under Safety and Security you're going to find

949
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
Notify me when

950
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
Blah

951
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
Click through that

952
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
Can I click button

953
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
Pick your button

954
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,144
First thing you want to do is

955
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
Hook your button into

956
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,960
Platform so it shows up

957
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
And then

958
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,592
This buttons only $15 so you can have these all around the house if you

959
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,152
Without spending a ton of money

960
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
Samsung

961
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
Samsung SmartThings

962
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
This is

963
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,296
In your home this is not outside your home

964
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,136
They do actually have a SmartThings button that's cellular powered Samsung

965
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
Sun also makes that

966
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
R outside

967
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
Thermostat something

968
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,608
But inside the home you can just do this it will send you a notification and or

969
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,656
Now

970
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,448
You mentioned sending it to a list

971
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,776
There's no function to basically send it to you

972
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,824
And then two minutes later sent to someone else it's

973
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
If you want

974
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,688
You have to create basically six rules

975
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,712
Phone numbers for

976
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,272
Same button press will then

977
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
Shootouts

978
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,624
Right there might be a way to it

979
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
Like if your

980
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,696
Enter programming it might be a way to

981
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,744
Create a custom notification method

982
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
Do that

983
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,656
Absolutely they are very open when it comes to creating your own

984
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,704
Device handlers and so on so that

985
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Good if that's not something

986
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,032
You want to do totally understand

987
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:16,128
I have seen some scripts that people put together to do something very similar

988
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,968
What you're asking so it's definitely possible if you want to mess the time

989
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,760
They do have a call at the

990
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Pushover

991
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
App so that would actually send notice

992
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
Vacations to Lake

993
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Devices

994
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
If you want to go that route

995
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:32,000
You spend all day on a computer or something like that you wanted to pop up while your

996
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,560
Hanging out in your Chrome browsers

997
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:40,192
Right yeah pushover is an API service that will basically turn something into a

998
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:45,824
What looks like a native notification just like it when an app send you a notification on your phone instead of an email or text

999
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,224
It's that kind of notification were talking about so that's possible and that's very customizable again he might have to do a little bit

1000
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
Programming but I looked at it

1001
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,344
And if we're talking maybe 10 lines of code and you can probably have

1002
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,160
Some rules apply after 2 minutes

1003
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:05,280
Ping this person via a notification then this person another 2 minutes later

1004
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,864
Gets out of The Simple Solution but it's doable

1005
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,656
So that is our recommendation

1006
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:15,264
You could also do something via a gift but we didn't like it because of latency

1007
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
And reliability issues

1008
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
So

1009
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,848
That's why we went with

1010
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
Plus cost wise you know

1011
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,432
You could Poppy's buttons all over

1012
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
There you go

1013
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
15 bucks

1014
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,576
A button in every room

1015
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
Maybe

1016
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,368
Multiples in every

1017
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
Yay

1018
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:32,928
All right

1019
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952

And now

1026
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,312
Stay tuned for our guest

1027
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,896
Tyson Tuttle who is the CEO of silicon labs

1028
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,712
Is a chipper that does all the radios that

1029
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,272
You know in love inside your home

1030
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,832
And even some others you may not know about

1031
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:05,440
Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast

1032
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,232
Ask for a message from our sponsor

1033
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,536
This week sponsor is urbanex

1034
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
Accelerator for startups

1035
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,376
Tackling difficult problems in today's

1036
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,936
So we have Gabe batstone

1037
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,240
Who is the CEO of context are

1038
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:22,336
An industrial software company that's focused on transforming the future of work

1039
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,360
True AI

1040
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,664
So let's get this started with

1041
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
Summit pretty base

1042
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,016
How do you guys Envision transforming the future of

1043
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
Work

1044
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,832
Well the context are a little slice of

1045
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:36,416
The future work is really focused on what we call Blue Collar AI

1046
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,440
And that means

1047
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,488
Providing technology that supports

1048
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,536
People with warm hands on cold

1049
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:46,144
Cold Steel write these are the people who make our trains roll our planes fly in our building

1050
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,472
And imagine if we can create an environment

1051
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,544
Any piece of Machinery equipment

1052
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,568
About when it was made

1053
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,152
We're going to make those jobs

1054
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,456
More productive more safe and frankly more simulator

1055
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
So contacts there is also an urban X startup

1056
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,880
Can you tell me a little bit about why you participated in the program and what you get out of it

1057
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:11,232
It was an interesting decision myself

1058
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
No we are not

1059
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,816
Young Angelina

1060
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,864
Industrial software for a couple of decades

1061
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,912
Michelle working with heavy weights like Lockheed Martin

1062
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,728
Boeing and so on

1063
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:26,080
And so it was a natural necessarily to go into an accelerator environment

1064
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:30,432
But we found it

1065
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,504
Collaboration

1066
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
With a design Focus

1067
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,320
Does make

1068
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:40,928
You think differently worth considering

1069
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,232
Greenpoint Brooklyn

1070
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,280
Meet the people in the location

1071
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:50,144
An association with BMW and something that seems like a no-brainer

1072
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,192
It's a great impact on their business

1073
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,216
Everything from

1074
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
Public relations

1075
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,288
Networking to just start ideas

1076
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:00,640
We love that relationship and we're proud to be a part of that community

1077
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:04,480
So by making it easier to communicate with industrial machinery

1078
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,272
What are kind of the big challenges

1079
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,552
You're trying to solve

1080
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,880
What's funny the challenges change from

1081
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:16,768
It seems like only a year ago that I was talking a lot about how do we deal with the end of work and there's not going to be any jobs

1082
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,584
Iron Man vs Skynet in the workplace

1083
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:24,960
And that is melted into the Global Steel shortage where now we don't have enough

1084
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,056
Interesting

1085
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,360
Foundational elements of

1086
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
Demographic shift

1087
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,920
Digital transformation

1088
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:38,528
And I need for technology to be implemented in the workplace in a way that

1089
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,064
Again can make people

1090
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,392
Safer more productive and be able to do their jobs

1091
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:50,048
And when you can match that altogether you start to then get solutions that not only changed companies but Industries and hopefully the entire

1092
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,376
And where can people go to find out more

1093
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
Qunar website

1094
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,736
Hey everyone welcome back

1095
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,296
Watch The Internet of Things podcast this is your host

1096
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
Stacey Higginbotham

1097
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
And today's guest

1098
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,136
Is Tyson Tuttle

1099
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,440
Who is the CEO of Silicon Valley

1100
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,744
The chip company here in Austin they do

1101
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
All our favorite networks on the show

1102
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
Bluetooth

1103
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,400
It's fun they also do

1104
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
So Tyson

1105
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
How are you doing

1106
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:33,568
Good great I really appreciate you for having me on and I'm excited to talk about all the

1107
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,360
Stuff going on in iot

1108
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
Before we go on no

1109
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,200
I know you guys don't do just radios what else do you

1110
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,040
Well we do over half of our business now is in iot

1111
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:49,440
Type of products that we do microcontrollers and wireless connectivity all the different ones that you just mentioned that we also have

1112
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,536
Products that go into infrastructure applications like high-speed data centers and

1113
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:58,656
Optical Communications and wireless infrastructure and then a whole bunch of products to go into Automotive

1114
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,960
Silly working a lot of areas but what's really

1115
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:07,360
Kind of cool is it if you think about you know where Electronics go in our lives so you know we're working on a lot of the things that are going to be these laws

1116
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:11,456
Long-term trends that are going to be no kind of transform the economy in the way we live

1117
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
All right

1118
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
So let's talk about

1119
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,040
Radios

1120
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,856
Because that's where I want to kick this off cuz that's almost where everything

1121
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
I feel like we're in this

1122
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Weird

1123
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,208
Point in the Smart Home

1124
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Where

1125
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,768
Z-Wave and zigbee feel like there

1126
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,376
If people are less inclined to use them and people are more inclined just a Wi-Fi

1127
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
Meanwhile

1128
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,216
We see things like Bluetooth and

1129
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,800
Even Zippy pushing into the Enterprise and somewhat the industrial

1130
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,872
Best smart home things

1131
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,176
Personal area networks are all moving in

1132
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
Is new areas

1133
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
Everywhere as always

1134
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,296
So talk to me about

1135
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,320
What you see with

1136
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,856
Future of radios in

1137
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,904
Smart home maybe Industrial

1138
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:58,560
Yes I could take a look at must-start with Wi-Fi and you know what you'll see ubiquitous technology that we all have in her home

1139
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:04,448
Are smartphones in our laptops and tablets and I guess televisions and other streaming media devices

1140
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
That's really where at

1141
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:11,104
Started and the reason for a lot of these other Technologies is because there are some

1142
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,896
Things that Wi-Fi has the challenge

1143
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:19,296
Do you have to operate off of you know very low power is in a lot of the things that we do and iot or command and control

1144
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:25,952
And you know for instance a door sensor or in a window sensor or something that you throw under your sink to

1145
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:32,352
Measure water in all the sorts of things they have to run off of a battery for a long time and it's going to be like to be off of a coin cell

1146
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,400
That's not really a good application

1147
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:39,008
4 Wi-Fi or you can even think about a door lock you know you don't have power in your door lock so you don't want

1148
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:45,408
The batteries to give out very quickly and set up for those kinetic control applications these other Technologies in particular zigbee

1149
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,432
Bensi Wayne worth

1150
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,968
Leading providers of both of those

1151
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:52,576
Protocols there really much more tailored to the command-and-control networks

1152
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
As opposed to Wi-Fi

1153
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,952
And another aspect of this which we can get into if they'd zigbee and Z-Wave

1154
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,280
State interoperate with other zigbee and Z-Wave devices

1155
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,840
And know how to talk to one another where is on

1156
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,400
Our Wi-Fi you typically just hook up to the Internet

1157
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,704
You're talking to the cloud but there's a robustness

1158
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,752
Aspect about 2 so a lot of the homes

1159
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,520
Security system

1160
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,616
Interested are on the Z-Wave protocol or a lot of the lighting applications

1161
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,920
Internet goes down you like for your lights

1162
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,968
Still turn off and on in for that to all work

1163
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
Together and so

1164
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,296
Those are some of the reasons why is it being Z-Wave have

1165
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,624
Yeah I'm taking over and then Smart Home Market in the home security Market

1166
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,928
So you're saying zigbee and Z-Wave

1167
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,720
Are still a big player in this

1168
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,536
And I don't disagree with that today but even if

1169
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,816
CES we saw

1170
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,584
2y

1171
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
WiFi locks

1172
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:39,680
Launch which I thought was crazy one solar-powered and one is

1173
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,216
Apparently highly engineered

1174
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,264
Do not require a bun

1175
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,312
Watch battery life so I look at this and

1176
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
Kind of like

1177
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,896
It's so much easier I'm not saying Z-Wave and zigbee lever

1178
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
Go away I'm just

1179
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,016
The Hobbit smaller slice or maybe the same slice of an ever-expanding

1180
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:58,112
I mean I think that's there's room for multiple Wireless Technologies

1181
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:01,184
In the whole man we can stay on the smart home for a while

1182
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,536
We've also got Bluetooth for streaming audio we've also got Bluetooth for a lot of the kids

1183
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,584
Similar devices that need to connect

1184
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,912
To our smartphones but you also have their a lot of you know you have

1185
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
2700

1186
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,496
Z-Wave devices available in lots of

1187
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,520
Lots of different things

1188
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:19,872
Is going on there and you have tons of zigbee devices that are out there you know everything

1189
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Spark plug

1190
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:27,040
To accommodation devices and all of that and then you have the hubs Witcher getting created that has

1191
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,064
Multiple Wireless

1192
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,880
Technology on your smartphone you have LTE and

1193
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:34,464
The cellular technology you have Wi-Fi you have Bluetooth for different use cases

1194
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,488
I think that there is

1195
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,048
Room for multiple Technologies within the home

1196
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,120
Certainly as you look at the limitations of

1197
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:47,520
Wi-Fi and we haven't really even started talking about mesh type of Technology where zigbee and Z-Wave are both messed

1198
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,056
Technology since other devices

1199
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:53,919
Talk to one another and it forms a more robust Network ways Wi-Fi is typically a

1200
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:58,271
Star Network are you just talking into the Hub and they're addressing that with some of the

1201
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,551
You no likey rower

1202
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,367
I was going to say everybody has a mesh now

1203
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:06,719
I certainly have that in my house

1204
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,791
But that's not necessarily the way that everybody has things

1205
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:16,191
So there's room for both of you look at the trends I mean you know the number of zigbee devices sold in the number of Z-Wave devices sold

1206
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:22,591
Is increasing substantially every year man also has he talked about particular on those zigbee side that you know getting

1207
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:26,687
The industrial applications as well as solution so that's also an interesting trend

1208
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,455
I know that we

1209
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
We haven't spoken

1210
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,783
This much on the industrial Enterprise use cases by

1211
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
Those radios

1212
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,087
Trying to get traction and

1213
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
World

1214
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,879
What do you think

1215
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,951
Something like Bluetooth needs to really gain adoption

1216
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,999
In the Enterprise rental space

1217
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:44,095
For one thing a lot of industrial applications and actually if you look at the

1218
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,399
Hundreds of our Rio tea business

1219
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,727
There are tons and tons of industrial applications unit

1220
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,543
Factory automation Smart City applications

1221
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:58,943
United listen to Smart Home in a lot of the 7-year look at retail and you look at Commercial Lighting and all of these sorts of things that again

1222
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,735
I'm actually in the industrial space there's

1223
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:06,623
An even wider variety of Wireless protocols there's the standards that we've been talking about what we actually have a

1224
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,647
Substantial

1225
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,927
Proprietary business

1226
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:12,767
In Wireless that supports a lot of the Legacy protocols and a lot of the companies

1227
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
What's the weather

1228
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:18,143
Exactly where you know clear connect to her I think we have

1229
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:24,543
Yeah we have over 50 Wireless protocols running on our wireless gecko platform so one of the things about our Hardware

1230
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:28,127
You can run all of these different protocols on it Digby Z-Wave

1231
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
Bluetooth

1232
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:35,295
And the light but you can also run some of the Legacy ones in a lot of people want to run you know what Legacy protocol they want to be able to up

1233
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:41,183
Date to a more modern protocol like Bluetooth or certainly Digby or even thread and a lot of times they want to have

1234
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:47,583
You know where you want to connect to a device with your smartphone directly as opposed to having to go over the network and the United Pursuit

1235
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,351
Vision North

1236
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:55,007
Controls are beacons assisted wide variety of applications that people like to use in an industrial

1237
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,591
Space and so it could be having flexibility upgradability

1238
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:04,991
And also multi-protocol capability are all things that are really attractive in the industrial space so you know what I think you see

1239
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:11,391
A trend towards moving towards more of the standards but also the need to remain backwards compatible with the networks that are all

1240
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Already deployed

1241
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,719
So that's a challenge but also I think an opportunity

1242
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,999
In the industrial area

1243
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,791
Last week I wrote about Bluetooth

1244
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,863
Because I think there's a lot of change happening

1245
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:21,887
With that standard

1246
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,679
It's gone from controlling

1247
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,983
My speaker with my smart phone or headphones

1248
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,567
And now it's just trying to be everywhere to everything.

1249
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,639
Talk to me about where you see Bluetooth going and how that's

1250
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,991
Yeah I mean we're definitely seeing strong demand for Bluetooth

1251
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,527
It'll be a lie and then

1252
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:44,415
The emergence of the Bluetooth mesh technology and it's in a wide range of applications you know from Smart Home

1253
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,695
Including the voice assistant

1254
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,791
You got residential lighting connected toys home automation devices

1255
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:56,191
Controllers in a smart locks are a good example if you know where you can unlock enough indicate and pom appliances you know

1256
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
Coffee makers

1257
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,263
And robotic devices and

1258
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:02,335
Proliferation of Bluetooth in a lot of bees

1259
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
Differin application

1260
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:07,711
And then you also see a lot going on it in the China Market we just announced

1261
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:14,111
You know what xiaomi which is out of the apple of China they have been a great echo system with the vehicle system there

1262
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:17,183
Selling scooters in the US but they sell thousands of different devices

1263
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:22,303
In China they're working on Bluetooth matching so we've partnered with them and are one of the first companies with it

1264
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,095
Bluetooth mesh stack that people can

1265
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
Take out the

1266
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:31,263
Play Weston design products for so a lot of different things going on in the Bluetooth Market

1267
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,287
Familiar with

1268
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,615
Because the camera the wyze camera the $20 one

1269
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,919
I know 1.5 million if you guys have

1270
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,247
That is actually looks just like xiaomi scammer

1271
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,527
So there you go

1272
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
All right

1273
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,063
What are the things

1274
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,087
To Tappan fairly recent

1275
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,623
Italy is Amazon buy

1276
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,183
Eero and we see a lot of

1277
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
Bigger company

1278
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,279
The smaller kind of startups that

1279
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,303
Iot space

1280
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,839
I don't think that's weird or anything

1281
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,119
But I'm curious

1282
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,911
What happens from a

1283
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679
Product design

1284
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,471
Perspective and how that affects

1285
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
You know your business

1286
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,519
1

1287
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,823
It's possible that all your individual customers

1288
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,615
Consolidate under just a few customers

1289
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,639
Which doesn't seem

1290
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,431
Great or two maybe they've got

1291
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,711
Better relationships

1292
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,991
Play other chip providers in there

1293
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
Lab

1294
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:20,927
I think that in the case of Amazon in particular it's pretty interesting every Nero has been a great partner of ours and the 15

1295
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:24,767
84 radio in there that run spread is one that we've worked on with them

1296
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:31,167
And that's a great mess technology in the home and can be an enabler in a window into all the other devices and then you've got ring

1297
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,447
You know they came in

1298
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:38,847
With the home security system and that was actually Z-Wave technology and natively with Amazon they've got Ziggy technology

1299
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,919
So I think that you know what you talk about the multiple protocols

1300
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:47,295
Those all come together in that way but it's also you have the larger companies while they're going to build a lot of things

1301
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,111
I think they're also trying to enable

1302
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,647
A broader ecosystem of

1303
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:58,047
Providers and really streamlined the interface for people in the home you know whether it's a voice interface or getting devices to

1304
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:04,447
Work together or to provide the gateways into do levels of integration that any individual company might not make so I think

1305
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,775
Actually opens up opportunity not just for us

1306
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:14,175
Provide silicon into those applications but actually it will accelerate the adoption of these iot Tech

1307
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,711
Technologies and make them more accessible

1308
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,759
So in your position

1309
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,039
I feel like you are

1310
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:25,695
Right there where you can see what's happening and iot the big trends that we should be thinking about going forward

1311
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:28,255
I know probably a year ago you and I talked about

1312
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:31,327
Improving Security on the chip side for iot

1313
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
I know you guys

1314
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,143
Are doing that with some second-generation

1315
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,167
Products

1316
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,703
And we can talk about specifics around

1317
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:41,567
So curious what else are you guys seeing and thinking about designing in

1318
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,359
Next Generation silicon

1319
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,663
If we're talking just about silicon

1320
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,199
Security is a big part

1321
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,735
And that's really getting

1322
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,271
You know payment grade

1323
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:56,671
Type of security you know like what you'd be using with a smart card or the SIM card in your smartphone but being able to get the

1324
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,951
Daughter to costpoint

1325
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:04,351
And to be able to execute that was really really low power consumption that can be appropriate for iot devices and then

1326
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:10,751
Figuring out how to make that standards of security is absolutely a big part of what we're doing it's a part of our first gen but

1327
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,543
We're doing further optimization and

1328
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,335
Integration on the 2nd gen

1329
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,359
Products and then

1330
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:21,759
You just look at you know as you're pushing silicon technology along you know driving power consumption for longer battery life

1331
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:25,855
Driving longer-range the same time increasing the

1332
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,951
Yeah the memory in the microcontroller functionality so that you can design

1333
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,535
You know some basically you can think about it is fairly simple

1334
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,863
AI type of functionalities that you can do more processing

1335
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:42,495
And do more intelligent looking at sensors and things like that within the same footprint of cost then

1336
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,519
Within the same footprint

1337
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:49,919
Power and so that's what's really exciting about the Next Generation silicon as well as just being able to have it work over and Eva

1338
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,455
Broader range of applications

1339
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,991
How do you think the world

1340
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,015
Which change

1341
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:58,367
Technology industry would need to change if we actually wanted to build

1342
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,903
An internet of things that

1343
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
Add more

1344
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,231
Local control in maybe

1345
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,767
A lot less data going up

1346
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:05,791
Cloud

1347
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,863
Are focuses primarily on the devices

1348
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:15,263
At the very edge the sensors and no devices that we all think about is connected and we also work

1349
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,823
At the Gateway level to make sure that they're all talking

1350
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,151
To one another but if you talk about the limitations at the very edge

1351
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:27,295
In many cases I mean if you think about the tens of billions of iot devices being deployed you're not going to run a wire

1352
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
Every one of them

1353
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,855
And so you end up with

1354
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:36,255
That's substantial number of these devices with fundamental constraints on the amount of power you talked about it.

1355
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:42,655
Door lock with a solar cell or something like that energy harvesting is one way but it's really hard to guarantee 100% of the

1356
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
Time that that works

1357
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:49,311
So you're stuck with the little coin cell battery is or things like that and you don't want to replace them very often and that's it

1358
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:53,663
Fundamental you no limit as to another trade-off between the battery life

1359
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:57,503
And the amount of processing that's done in so that's why we've had just a

1360
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:01,599
Tremendous focus on being able to integrate more memory more processing power

1361
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:07,999
You know more clever since our interfaces and ways of communicating more efficiently so that you can maximize the song

1362
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:08,767
Functionality

1363
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,535
Within

1364
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,071
Given energy

1365
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:14,399
I think at this very very edge there's a lot of innovation

1366
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,423
Going there

1367
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
And

1368
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:22,847
You know as well as innovating around use cases in the partitioning of the processing that's there and at the Gateway and how much gets up to the

1369
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:28,991
The clouds I think there's a huge amount of innovation I think one of the wireless protocols also kind of play into that a little bit as though

1370
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:32,831
To the extent that they can become more spectrally efficient or you can drive

1371
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:38,975
You no further optimization of the power consumption at the wireless level that that also opens up a little bit more opportune

1372
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:43,839
30 as well but the architecture you know within the data center in the cloud has made

1373
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:47,935
Huge strides but as you push that further down it starts to look a little bit different

1374
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,263
All right will Tyson thank you so much for coming on the show today

1375
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,799
All right I really appreciate

1376
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,127
You taking the time to talk to us it's exciting to see what's going on out there

1377
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:02,015
