00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,944
So for all of you guys sitting there asking what can I do

17
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,480
The answer

18
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
Will come

19
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,784
After this week's News segment

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
So

21
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,088
Stay tuned for all of that

22
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:03,488
But first a word from this week's sponsor sponsor is Ayla Networks

Aylaa

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,520
All right back to the show Kevin

31
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
Should we get started with

32
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
Google thing

33
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,408
Sure wish I could start with Google things and it's

34
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
As long as we

35
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:00,064
Ride it my normal disclosure out that I do work full-time for Google as a consultant

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,416
I do not work in any way shape or form on their iot stuff so my opinion

37
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
Your pigeons

38
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,512
That's true I never give them away

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
So actually you do

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
You give your

41
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
If you give them away for

42
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
Free

43
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
That's right that's right this this actually surprised me this news so we talked about Google things a couple weeks ago which

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,688
Ryzen android-based iot platform from Google

45
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
Essentially take the place of

46
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,808
Cortical project brillo and all that

47
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,368
Yeah it's actually Google

48
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
Android

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
Just been named

50
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:46,400
Google thinks this is one of the many Google things but it's actually called Android thinks you're right

51
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
This is their platform

52
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
You said every place is Brillo

53
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:55,616
It's actually kind of platform it is connected device requires actually

54
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Significant

55
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,480
SPAC shame the platform

56
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
Sorry

57
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
I had to say it

58
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
If it's okay

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
This is

60
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:11,488
This requires a lot of memory and isn't really for sensors it's more for things that will be

61
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
Controlling the Senate

62
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,608
I'm not fat shaming anybody

63
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,448
Just coming to

64
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Jewel

65
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,008
Five seven

66
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
Which is

67
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
Call it it's a fact

68
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
Computer board it's a big computer

69
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
And I'm not touching it

70
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,528
Computing be like fat pigs especially if we wanted to make stuff with it

71
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
The jewel 570 is capable of doing

72
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,648
4K video

73
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,024
Ram it's got 16 gigabytes of storage and WiFi

74
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
And it's a big board

75
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
What is this

76
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,960
It surprises me because of the existing supported Android things boards Witcher

77
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
Lower power

78
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
Slimmer

79
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,664
If we go down that thing like the Raspberry Pi in Intel's Edison chip and XPS Pico board

80
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
This is using

81
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,808
A revamped Intel Atom Processor and again for Giga as you said

82
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,184
It supports even with the realsense 3D depth camera so it's adding a lot more power

83
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,744
I was just surprised because the other existing

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
Supported boards are

85
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,095
Not the Lesser boards but less are capable

86
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,167
Yes well I think this is actually really good because

87
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
This looks like a

88
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Great board

89
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Play with robotics

90
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
Because of the recent

91
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
3D depth

92
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
Capacity

93
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,687
So I think it's a really forward-looking move for Android

94
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Just because

95
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
This is actually really interesting platform

96
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
For it robotics

97
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
Out of the Smart Home

98
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
Crazy iot

99
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
We haven't even really

100
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
Experience

101
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:58,239
Right at night I agree with your baby when I think of the traditional stuff that's supported you know you don't need all that power

102
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
But it's a good point

103
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,847
Looking had that things that move around

104
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
Things that

105
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
Need more power this does make sense it's going to be interesting to see what developers do with it cuz it I assume it'll be one of those

106
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,135
Developer cats on the Android things website soon cuz I don't see it there just yet

107
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,207
This could be good for like Industrial

108
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
Oreck commercial settings

109
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,119
They shouldn't miss out on

110
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
They should totally

111
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
If they can

112
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
And also who else should not

113
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,543
Miss out on the space and I didn't tell

114
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,383
Which because the spaces really been driven by a arm architecture type

115
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
Processing power

116
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,527
And yes Intel Edison is supported but I don't see many people Billy stuff on the Edison

117
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,087
By comparison to what they're building a Raspberry Pi's

118
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:51,231
And such a later in the show on a different arm board that you're going to be using for openhab2 nope so

119
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
Prevalently

120
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,559
This industry has been built on arm so

121
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,351
Again until can't miss out on that

122
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
All right

123
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
So let's

124
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
YouTube app

125
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
Because we can

126
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Because we

127
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,663
Last week I promised to get started doing open house

128
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,455
Because there is now a new version of oppa

129
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,015
Have in this is a smart home

130
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599
Hub Software System is open source

131
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
On the eclipse Foundation

132
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,951
Basically it is like the most powerful

133
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
Inflexible system out there

134
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,791
It requires a lot of technical

135
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,095
Or maybe not a lot that's what I mean

136
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Discover

137
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,215
As an update on the project I went out and bought a

138
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Ein

139
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,311
A 64 board Kevin already has one Kevin

140
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
Help me out with this

141
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,639
I went out and bought the 2GB combo set

142
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,967
Which has the board itself a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

143
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Sheet module

144
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
A microSD card

145
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
With the software I'm going to need to run it all though

146
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
That's actually not the software on

147
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Use

148
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
I'm going to use an opa

149
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
Have card

150
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
And

151
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
Power supply in a

152
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
And then I also bought

153
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
Easy way for

154
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,887
And so the total for these two things

155
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
90 bucks space

156
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,983
And that may sound like a lot

157
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,383
Now I got my pine64 I got the same board that you got I also bought it early right now you can buy that board for about

158
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
30 bucks

159
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,223
And that's just giving you all the processing power in your ports but

160
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,087
It's another $10 for example to add the Bluetooth Wi-Fi so that's in your starter kit

161
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,927
You're getting an acrylic case I don't have a case or mine actually took an old

162
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,743
Raspberry Pi case like I'm kind of covered in that regard

163
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:34,399
Power supply power supply is super important with pine64 anybody

164
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,983
He's buying app on 64 I highly recommend you get the power supply

165
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
When you buy the board

166
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,335
Even though it's a micro USB power supply

167
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
You like

168
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,711
Plenty of these must have a hundred things in my closet from other phones I bought

169
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
10 years

170
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:54,367
It's very very specific on the voltage on there's very little tolerance for error here

171
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,159
And I tried about 4

172
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:02,559
Micro USB phone charger with micro USB and I could not get the pine64 to

173
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
Boot up

174
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,935
And after we're going to the pine64 wiki which is fantastic and great resource

175
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,263
I found out all this information on the power supply and the

176
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
The voltage that is needed

177
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,127
And luckily I found one that has exact voltage

178
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,783
And booted up like a charm so you're getting old the one that you know is going to work and that's going to take a lot of their frustration

179
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
Out of it that I had

180
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Yes

181
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,415
Because there is nothing more than I hate the digging through my bag

182
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
Words in trying to

183
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
What and what makes it

184
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:38,143
More frustrating is a non-supportive power supply will actually light up the little LED On the Border like

185
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,935
It's getting power

186
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,519
I can't be the issue and you end up troubleshooting all these other issues

187
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,335
That aren't really issues it's actually the voltage

188
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
All right

189
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:53,247
So that is the update there now we should move on too exciting other things such as

190
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
Freezies

191
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
Surety and

192
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
Personal privacy issue

193
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
I think we should start dinner

194
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:05,791
Let's talk about this dude who basically self incriminated himself in our Sky because

195
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,095
This story has pretty much everything

196
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
Yeah

197
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
The interesting thing is there's nothing

198
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,103
IRT assure smart homie about this it but obviously it does get to the privacy issues that are related to these device

199
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,943
I suspect this was a standard pacemaker that is the focus of the story correct

200
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Yes

201
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
So this guy

202
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,295
Apparently was committing insurance fraud

203
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,879
And he decided to burn down his house

204
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,719
So this man his name is Ross Compton this was back in September 26

205
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,791
He's being charged with setting his house on fire

206
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,631
Police when I talked to him he admitted that he had a

207
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
Artificial heart

208
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,007
So the investigators use data from his

209
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Peacemaker

210
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,359
To show his cardiac date right before the

211
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,151
Fire started to show that

212
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
She was able to

213
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
Move all of the stuff and do all of this stuff

214
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,319
Because the data from his pacemaker didn't correspond with

215
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
His version

216
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Stop the story

217
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
Right

218
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,719
If you say you woke up in your house is on fire and you ran out

219
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,279
Which the pacemaker would show that you were

220
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
I'm sleeping

221
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
Then you ran out but

222
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,679
It looks like the date of the Pacemakers allegedly showing that

223
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
He was pretty active before the fire

224
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Yes

225
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
Now what's

226
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,847
Also worth noting that he had gasoline on his

227
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
Including as well

228
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:28,479
So depressed

229
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
PowerPoint switches

230
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
Usual infires

231
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Not arson

232
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
So

233
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
There's a couple questions here

234
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,487
When is did they have to go for the pacemaker

235
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
Is the pacemaker data

236
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,351
You don't just that there's there's a

237
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,375
5th Amendment

238
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Closet

239
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,471
Constitution of I'm trying to decide what the right words here this is hard for

240
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
The Fifth Amendment

241
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
Says you don't have to incriminate yourself

242
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,103
Allstate when you plead the 5th which we see all the time

243
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Congressional

244
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,759
So the question is is your pacemaker did yours so this is like incriminating

245
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,319
Yourself or does it belong to someone else

246
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,647
Police can get it and

247
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,439
It is not selfish

248
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,743
So that's actually really

249
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
Interesting legal question

250
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
And neither of us are lawyers so

251
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,167
All we have are in a just outside opinions on

252
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
I'm assuming

253
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
My personal opinion is

254
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:28,639
That pacemaker data is his data it's not going to a third party or anything like that

255
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:34,015
As a way to transmit it to his doctor and so on so forth and then there's

256
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
What kind of policies do they have for privacy and so on

257
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
It's not like he's

258
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
Uploading a stuff to a server every day I presume

259
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,767
So if those details are not

260
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Correct

261
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,375
And this is not a voluntary device I mean

262
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
Pacemaker

263
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Is

264
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,639
That is so kind of crazy

265
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:07,039
Is it really interesting case it actually I'm going to have a lawyer come on the show in a few weeks time

266
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
And I sent this case off to her S1

267
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
Point to talk about so

268
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
For that because

269
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Scary

270
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
It seems like with the case about the

271
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
The Amazon Echo

272
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,679
Police are looking at this data and they're saying hey

273
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,239
This is a treasure Trove of information

274
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
So this next story is

275
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
Also about scary things with

276
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
This

277
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,783
Involves a hotel getting hacked its door lock system getting hacked

278
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
Held for ransom

279
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Basically

280
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,671
So this is the

281
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Kevin

282
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
The Romantic sea Hotel

283
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,583
Cigarette Alpine Lakes Lakeside Alpine hotel in

284
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
Australia minutes by car from Salt

285
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
So what happened

286
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,103
Hackers basically got into the system no one was locked in their rooms known as locked out of their rooms but

287
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
B Hotel couldn't

288
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Program

289
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,943
The key cards for the door

290
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
For new people yeah

291
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,879
And I thought this was really interesting because basically this is a ransomware attack there like you enter access controls this

292
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,415
Custom back pay us in bit

293
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
2 Bitcoins

294
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Which I don't know

295
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,583
Know about 1850 ish

296
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
$1,850

297
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:34,079
That's a matter of perspective I suppose but considering that if you couldn't take any new guests

298
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
So you could lose a lot more money than

299
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
The not so yes

300
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
True

301
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,015
So this is the sort of thing that I actually think we should be

302
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,855
Worried about ransomware is going to be a huge

303
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,183
Easy topic for hackers right now with the iot

304
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
And I think it's going to come in the

305
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:56,863
The Forum has maybe it's hotels later on we're going to talk about it with our guests actually because apartment

306
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
Dwellings art

307
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
Great Target

308
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,495
Because they're so many people I think maybe like a company like nest

309
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
Might be

310
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,615
Kobe cars I mean you want to start your car today you need to pay me a hundred bucks

311
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,175
Yeah so I don't know if it's going to go towards

312
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
The individual level I think eventually if it's really easy it could

313
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
You want to control your thermostat

314
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Haney half a bit

315
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
Yak

316
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,511
After the centralized

317
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Administrative

318
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:31,935
Consoles where they get the maximum effects and then and then they also have a company

319
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,239
It has a lot more money collectively then

320
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,055
Although this is a relatively small amount of money

321
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,383
For a hat

322
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,455
40000 or even a hundred thousand.

323
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,015
I obviously don't condone this

324
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,319
But if I was one of these hackers

325
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,719
This actually makes sense this type of lower amount if you make it too much it's it just becomes a it's a lot easier

326
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:59,071
Easier for a company to pay $1,800 and get rid of the problem example of 1850

327
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
As opposed to

328
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
I want a million dollars how many

329
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
So yes

330
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
This is

331
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,407
You're worth noting for

332
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
And

333
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
I don't know

334
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,039
It Feels Like A Brave New World here and hopefully

335
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Hopefully we're

336
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:28,255
We comes down to one of the key things we discussed on a weekly basis not security

337
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
And then companies

338
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,839
Iot companies and service providers

339
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,911
If you're not making security one of your top

340
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,263
Pillars of your product or service you're just asking for trouble

341
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,103
And it's not just part of the product or service though it's also things like

342
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,151
Access to your database in

343
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
In the cloud

344
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
It's got to be secure

345
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Absolutely

346
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
From beginning to end

347
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:55,647
With that in mind the Boston Consulting Group issued a report this month saying that

348
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:02,047
Companies are expected to spend 250 billion euros by 2020 on the in

349
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Internet of Things

350
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,911
That translates into 260

351
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
9

352
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
Billion

353
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
US dollars

354
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Switches

355
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
Quite a considerable sum

356
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:19,199
And this report which will link to into in the show notes because it's got so much good data

357
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
Talks about basically how to pray

358
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,575
Prepare for the Internet of Things companies really need to have

359
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,439
Good business processes so they should start with use cases first

360
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,767
They should understand what they're doing and he hears those words

361
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,071
And they should develop into in solution

362
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:43,007
The report goes into a lot of death about how all this is going to come about and they also focus on

363
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,055
10 use cases that will drive iot

364
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,151
Those include things that we heard and talked about sex to predictive maintenance

365
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,967
This one's really interesting self optimizing

366
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
Production

367
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,039
Which is kind of corollary to

368
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Predictive

369
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Maintenance

370
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,183
Ideas connect to factories can use iot to monitor

371
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
Their production processes

372
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
And then

373
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:07,327
Make automated adjustments to improve quality or

374
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,351
Efficiency and

375
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,447
Inventory management is another

376
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
Remote patient monitoring

377
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,287
Zack and we're bringing back the pacemaker

378
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,127
Smart meters which we talked about for like a decade

379
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,175
And is actually a real thing

380
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
It's just going to get better

381
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Fleet Management

382
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
Connected cars

383
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
Distributed generation

384
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
And Storage

385
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
This is for energy again

386
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
It's actually something that

387
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
People are really excited about

388
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,071
Things like Tesla's powerwall technology which utility in California just

389
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
Open data to the grid

390
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,471
Things like that we're going to be seeing those things really

391
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
I guess start to come online soon

392
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,431
It's it's interesting in the BCG report that they have a time frame for maturity for Ollie's

393
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,223
Topics that you just mention and

394
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:02,879
I'm not surprised to see remote patient monitoring being the farthest out for maturity and the reason being is

395
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,951
Is all the privacy laws and some we're still figuring all that out

396
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,023
We're going to get there because we have

397
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,327
We are hitting a demographic

398
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Crisis in

399
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
Actually everywhere

400
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,191
Where there not enough doctors to see people

401
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,007
And the doctors aren't necessarily in the right place

402
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,543
As a patient so

403
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,079
This is going to become really

404
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
YouTube people ask your Echo

405
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,455
Here are my symptoms what should I do

406
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
By the way

407
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,575
Let's talk about new skills for your personal assistant

408
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
Because holy cow

409
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
There's some really cool stuff

410
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Morris County

411
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,463
So this is a Google home tips

412
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
This Is Us in it

413
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,303
Brought this up and I had no idea this

414
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,375
Could happen but you can actually tell your Google home

415
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
To remember

416
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
Where you put things

417
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
So

418
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
You say hey G

419
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,823
Remember that my passport is in

420
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
My dresser drawer

421
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
And then

422
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Later on you can be like

423
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,503
He where is my password

424
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
And it will tell you

425
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Which is crazy

426
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,879
It's actually it's a really slick

427
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
Tips and tricks

428
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,999
To use because when we think of tracking we always thinking of

429
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
Devices

430
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
It was slap a Bluetooth

431
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,143
Tag on something you know and that way you just go to your app and you go find it

432
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
But this is using

433
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,983
I mean this is like writing down a notepad

434
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,775
My password is in the dresser

435
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,847
And then putting that note somewhere hoping that you don't lose that too

436
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,407
So it's it's a way to voice tag

437
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
Where things are

438
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,223
Now the key is

439
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,527
To keep it simple because

440
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,343
This is probably not like I put my keys on the counter

441
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Tennis standings

442
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
This is probably more for

443
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
Like esoteric things like

444
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,743
Your voter registration card to send this file

445
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,303
You're going to have to remember

446
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,839
What you told it

447
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,887
So you're going to have to say hey

448
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,703
LG where is my voter registration

449
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
And

450
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
Too many of those

451
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
I forgot what you told it

452
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:02,431
Yes you do need to be very specific in what you call things but

453
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
If you

454
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,991
Set up a reminder

455
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
In the most

456
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,367
First thing that comes to your mind most common sense thing and you're describing an object

457
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,903
What time you'll be okay

458
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,767
Totally see myself setting all kinds of things

459
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,887
I don't know let's ask

460
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
What did I tell you Google

461
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:35,455
I wonder also you can actually live going down the path that you can't remember what you called something

462
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,783
I'm pretty sure don't call me and we can check this

463
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
Pretty sure there are many ways to see what

464
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:48,255
Data Google has are you provided to Google because I know you can export that dated someone so worth it would not surprise me if they

465
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,815
List of all those things are available to you online

466
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
Getting to it

467
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
I will say the Google home

468
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,679
App drives me nuts

469
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Because

470
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
It defaults to like

471
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
Play Store

472
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
Not the play store YouTube

473
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Google

474
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Whatever store

475
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,871
As opposed to like cards that

476
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Inform you of

477
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,223
But you're probably right I don't have my phone right now

478
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
Text me so I can't

479
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
Here is the other skill that I was like

480
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,111
We got to talk about this which is Starbucks

481
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
Is now taking orders

482
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Echo

483
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,976
And through its iOS

484
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,768
And he's our voice orders

485
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,072
Because obviously Starbucks has had an app for a while

486
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,120
You have to have the Starbucks app

487
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
Once you enable that skill on your Echo you can say

488
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,520
Hey she who shall not be named

489
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
Order me

490
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
A Starbucks latte

491
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
It's even apparently

492
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,920
Half-caf soy milk

493
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,456
Grande latte you problem

494
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,504
Probably will have to say Grande in

495
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
Inventi and all of the words

496
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
What's that

497
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
I thought that was released

498
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:53,280
Yeah it's I wish I'd known about yesterday was in New York City and it was cold and I stopped in at Starbucks

499
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,376
Just use the applicant only went to pay I didn't know about that sort of tried it

500
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,800
Order order me a grande white mocha I'll be there in

501
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:11,200
3 hours cuz that's how long it takes me to get to New York City

502
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,504
Graham called Lexia on my phone

503
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,368
Right so you could theoretically just use the Lexi app to

504
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,696
Be a proxy to your Echo and do it that way

505
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Skills

506
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,840
Let's see what else should we talk about

507
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,632
We got to talk about

508
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
Question

509
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
From

510
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
Which is

511
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,568
We got a question about how to start

512
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,152
I don't mean like how to turn it on or nothing like that I mean

513
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,688
If you're going to build a smart home

514
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,992
What is start and it's actually

515
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,552
It's not a simple answer to that and the reason being

516
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,600
In my mind is like to your pic

517
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,696
A hug first and then you're locked into the certain devices that work that up

518
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,792
Do you pick what devices you want first and then go find a hub that works with those devices

519
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
Do

520
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
Pick a voice control unit for speed

521
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,936
Echo Google home or some other solution

522
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:09,312
I don't there's no right answer here but I'd be curious to what your thoughts are Stacy mine are

523
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
I would probably pick

524
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,992
What devices I want first and then see what Hub is going to support most or all of those cuz

525
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,040
There is some difference between

526
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
What is a wink hub

527
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,416
Support Services with a SmartThings Hub supports and so on

528
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:28,768
And then face on that then you can pick your voice control unit who works with those hubs

529
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
Yes

530
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,864
There are two things that I always ask

531
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,912
When they cuz I get this

532
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,216
Question all the time all the time

533
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
So I asked him

534
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
1

535
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,312
What do you want to do

536
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,872
Because your use case is by far the most in

537
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
Agreed

538
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,992
But if you don't know cuz some people are now with the echo they're like

539
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
I just want to

540
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
Turn my lights on

541
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,832
Wait that's what you want

542
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
The second question for them

543
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,280
Is what kind of phones do

544
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,608
Use or what kind of existing Digital Services

545
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,912
And I asked them that because

546
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,472
There's the homekit question

547
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
Which

548
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,056
Honestly I don't recommend people cuz it

549
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
Apple

550
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,944
And so many people don't have

551
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,992
I felt so many people do

552
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
Right

553
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
It's very bifurcate

554
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,112
So I always ask them.

555
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,672
And from there I basically go down the path of

556
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
Like the best products in

557
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,304
Those things now it's someone's just like I want to make my home smart I'm like you know what start

558
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
Lights because

559
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
It's such a great

560
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
Easy use case

561
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:46,848
Is ice tear them to Voice Control because that's going to be the best way to control lights

562
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,408
And so I steer them to an echo or a hoe

563
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
I steer them to

564
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,016
Either the Hue bulbs

565
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Cuz they're easy

566
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,112
Although they're expensive and I tell them

567
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
Toyota Center

568
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,672
Or I steer them to

569
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
The WeMo

570
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
Because

571
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,304
It's a it's an easy to implement outlet that works with Google home

572
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
So

573
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,656
Those are the kind of 2

574
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,448
To use cases

575
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
Able to

576
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,568
If they want to get really excited and delights

577
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:22,688
Because I really recommend switches and then that gets into Lake scary things

578
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
Like electricity

579
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,016
And then people are like I don't

580
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:33,184
I steer away from switches for the same reason I mean you do installation for some people it's just overwhelming so be it and it's fine

581
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:39,328
I kind of prefer going with the bulb route over switches because I often find it cheaper

582
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Really

583
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:48,032
Yeah I mean what's it what's a to swap out a light switch these days how much does it cost to a tablet connected light switch

584
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,824
5265 2

585
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,104
Depending on the switch

586
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
But then you can usually

587
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,368
Since you're going to get a hub anyway I don't feel like wiring I'm like you know what you spend fifteen $20 per bulb

588
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
It just seems

589
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:11,328
Cheaper and it's a lot easier to switch a ball that is to switch a switch

590
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
The switch turns off

591
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Yep

592
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:20,032
No question about it and that's that's where duct tape is your friend just duct tape it up now hitting a kid

593
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,104
Play right that's that's the first thing people say what

594
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,896
Yeah you're right you're absolutely right

595
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
Can't argue with that

596
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,248
So those are like The Big Heist

597
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
I would say

598
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,552
2 somewhere

599
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,600
Looking at the space

600
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,648
Is a MyQ garage door

601
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
I see that

602
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,000
Because it is such a wonderful

603
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
Use case for like

604
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
90% of the world

605
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,096
Which is

606
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,144
You can see if your garage door is open

607
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,704
Switch a lot of people are really like

608
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,472
Concerned about

609
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
Who did

610
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,032
And so I think

611
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,360
It doesn't work with anything else because the Chamberlain

612
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,432
They don't want you to be able to say

613
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
You know hey Echo

614
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
Open someone's garage door because they

615
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
Security issue

616
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
But

617
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
It's freaking

618
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Awesome

619
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,416
To have it on your phone to be able to check it

620
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
Condor Avenue

621
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,976
Application when it's been open

622
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,024
And for too long so I actually

623
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,048
I gave that to my

624
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,584
My in-laws and they love it

625
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:21,216
Degree does another your two benefits that come to mind I mean one I've left

626
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
The house

627
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,568
Thinking of rajouri close behind me but maybe got jammed in

628
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:30,688
For safety reasons went back up and I did not see that since I'm leaving my garage door open all day unbeknownst to me

629
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,992
And to get a lot of packages

630
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,064
It's kind of Handy to be able to remotely

631
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,672
Open the garage door for somebody to drop a package off inside and close it behind them so

632
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,720
Benefits to those devices

633
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:51,424
One thing leads to another

634
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,960
Cameras

635
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,520
Just to get started you don't need to go Hog Wild

636
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,592
So yes if you're getting started I say pickle

637
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,432
Queso with its I'm worried about my garage being open maybe it's I'm worried about

638
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,736
Like I want to control my sprinkler remotely

639
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,320
Or maybe it's just I want to play with the smartphone

640
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
Sand

641
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
Personal assistant

642
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
Ways to go

643
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,744
So that is hard advice there

644
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Take it

645
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
And run with it

646
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
Because

647
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,096
It's so funny

648
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,376
You guys it really is

649
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
Superstar

650
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,216
Let's get to the news item

651
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,496
Before we

652
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,776
Move on to our guest

653
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Hey Kevin

654
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Profound

655
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,408
Yeah I just found out about something called

656
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:39,296
Ping and we talked about trackers earlier in the show saying it on Bluetooth

657
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,368
Slapping on a device or product and you can track it with Bluetooth

658
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,440
What happens with a Bluetooth tracker when you move out of range

659
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,256
Bluetooth trackers

660
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:53,632
So these folks at ping and it's a ping gps.com

661
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,192
How to get away what's inside

662
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,752
Have a Bluetooth tracker that also

663
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,288
Has GPS

664
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,664
But wait there's more it actually has a 3G cellular radio as well

665
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,456
So you pretty much have

666
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:12,064
Ubiquitous ranches pretty much anywhere within reason obviously

667
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,624
You can get a cell phone signal

668
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,208
See where this thing is because it's got all the radios inside

669
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,072
It reminded me of the the tile which is a Bluetooth tracker we talked about in the past

670
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:29,472
Because it's it's similarly shaped and it's not that big 1.34 in

671
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
Chi-square

672
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:35,872
So not much bigger than a quarter or a face of a Smartwatch for example

673
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,920
And it's got all these radios inside now

674
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,016
Early birds can get this for stability of $79

675
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:47,136
It's going to be quite a bit more expensive if you don't get in on the early bird I think it's a hundred

676
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:53,536
$30 but interesting thing is the cellular service so that you can go

677
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,584
Stop and find this thing pretty much anywhere

678
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:59,424
And then what happens after that year was my question so I dug around

679
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,472
$36 for

680
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,544
Cellular coverage for this Tim tracker

681
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,128
For each additional year and that's not bad $3 a month

682
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:12,480
To be able to track something pretty much anywhere well beyond the the

683
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:18,880
Range of Bluetooth so interesting to me I'm thinking about getting one not sure where I'd use it yet but you could you can put it on a pet

684
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,208
You can give it to a kid put in a backpack I mean there's a lot of

685
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,584
Yeah just look around the house and he's sleeping so

686
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,144
Interesting because it does put in

687
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,472
Far more radios in caused and is not

688
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
Terribly expensive

689
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:42,176
Roughly three months they say before need to recharge

690
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,992
That's great

691
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,904
It is rechargeable so it has a panic button built into so if you are out and about and something tear

692
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Terrible happens

693
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:57,792
You just click the panic button and contacts through the GPS and cellular radio will get notified

694
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,632
Nice all right

695
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
Other news is

696
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:11,360
We talked about them actually after CES because they were going to watch the App Store and one of the reasons we said that might make sense his

697
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,920
Because it's really hard to just sell devices

698
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,480
And make money and low and behold

699
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,528
There is a Slowdown in

700
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,344
Market Smartwatch kind of market and Fitbit

701
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,672
Laid off 6% of its staff which is about 100 in

702
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
Handjobs

703
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,232
And

704
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,816
They only sold 6.5 million

705
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,376
Devices in the fourth quarter of last year

706
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,704
And that was actually a good quarter for them cuz it includes the holidays and

707
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
App Store

708
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,848
So that's not great news

709
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,640
Fitbit CEO James Park

710
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,432
Says that they're actually

711
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,016
Making some Acquisitions I'm going to do some interesting cool things

712
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,320
They did bipedal they actually bought

713
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
Better watch

714
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
Some assets from

715
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:55,904
Coin

716
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,696
Which one you talk about next

717
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,976
So we could see

718
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:03,072
Payments and some other interesting things come here to make it a more compelling

719
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
Auction

720
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,704
Yeah I'm as far as coin a Fitbit bought coin

721
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,544
Back in May of last year and that is the programmable

722
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,568
Looks like a

723
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:18,944
It a smart credit card I guess you could say you can load it up with your credit card information and it looks like a credit card and

724
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,992
And companies can swipe it for

725
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:25,856
Payments but you don't need your credit cards there cuz I leave formation is stored in the card and

726
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,416
Then the magnetic strip is reprogrammed

727
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,256
Coinstar

728
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,536
Because some

729
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
Cardiff

730
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:43,520
Correct correction Fitbit botcoin last year they actually did say they're going to shut down the coin developer Pro

731
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:50,688
And they did that and now they're saying that the product services for coin will be shut down at the

732
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
The end of February

733
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
The cards

734
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,040
If you have a coin you can still use it

735
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,832
As long as the battery lasts

736
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,624
Because you can't replace the battery

737
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,208
But once the batteries God it's useless at that point

738
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
Sad

739
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,120
Grimm

740
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,424
Use the sad news bets for the day

741
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,264
Let us move on to our guests

742
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,288
Goodbye Kevin

743
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
Goodbye

744
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,360
And prepare yourself

745
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:26,016
For Felicity Mormon who is going to talk about smart Apartments

746
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:32,416
Hey everyone welcome back to the end

747
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:37,792
Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Felicity Mormon

748
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,328
Who is the CEO of Stratus

749
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
Hi Felicity

750
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,400
Hi Stacy how you doing

751
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
So well

752
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
So

753
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
First off we should talk about

754
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,032
What Stratus does so people get a sin

755
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,824
So what we're going to talk about so

756
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,848
Tell us about Stratus

757
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,176
Perfect status provides access

758
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,504
Energy and automation for multifamily

759
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,064
Which is commercial residential or apartments

760
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:06,976
So anybody who is renting an apartment right now and is still listening to the show despite our crazy focused on

761
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
Single family

762
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
This is your

763
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,816
Show

764
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,424
Those are you guys are in over a hundred and fifty thousand

765
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
Apartment

766
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,728
Peanuts right now

767
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:21,824
You guys door locks you do energy control little bit of automation

768
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,360
You do it all

769
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,920
From the perspective of the land

770
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,992
The right that's cracked we really focus

771
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,832
On a return on investment for your property owner or manager

772
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,672
We find but they're the ones who are purchasing the technology

773
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,952
To put into the building

774
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,280
So our focus is on making sure if he's been by

775
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,584
Why would a property manager

776
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
Put

777
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
Connected

778
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
Devices

779
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,448
There's a ton of reason

780
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:52,544
The most frequent reason we see like I said his return on investment

781
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,616
So if you have an access manager

782
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896
Control platform

783
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
That French

784
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,968
Bluetooth as ours is

785
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,552
Suddenly you don't rekey door locks anymore

786
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,624
You don't replace credentials with hard cheese

787
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,904
Now you're at

788
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
Troy just

789
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
Sending a credential

790
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
To the phone

791
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,280
Or even a smart card or fob

792
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,840
But you're no longer creating

793
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Those hearts

794
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,656
And if you think about hospitality

795
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,728
Princeton when was the last time you used the heart

796
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,008
Christian hospitality

797
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,592
We don't do it anymore for me as well

798
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,128
Jackie

799
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,920
And frankly the same thing for energy

800
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,992
Martyr control of your buildings energy usage

801
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,552
The residents when they leave

802
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
There's a real return

803
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,160
On managing. Unit

804
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
For you

805
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,256
And not the maintenance person whose painting it

806
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,072
So we're seeing real return on investment

807
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
But that's not the only reason

808
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,912
Multifamily the hot Market

809
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,496
There's a lot of buying and selling the wing on a building

810
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,824
And it's a great way to differentiate your property

811
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,640
When there is a super sexy Tower going up across

812
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,712
So you throw in some Bluetooth door locks

813
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,248
Smart thermostat

814
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,296
And you can actually LeapFrog

815
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,320
The new construction

816
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,344
If they're not careful

817
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
Got it

818
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
So

819
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,952
Most people who live in apartments are like

820
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,256
My landlord won't let me put in a nest

821
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,048
My landlord won't let me

822
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,584
You know put the August lock on

823
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,168
Can you talk about some of the Practical reasons why

824
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,544
Yeah absolutely so that door lock is a big deal

825
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:32,384
You don't want as a property owner or manager

826
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,920
To be locked out of that unit

827
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
For maintenance

828
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,480
For emergency

829
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,016
From a fire marshal

830
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:41,344
Perspective you have to have control of all of the credentials

831
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
In your building

832
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160
You're legally liable

833
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:50,560
So if you switch that out without your property owner or manager knowing and there is a maintenance issue or a management animal

834
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
Emergency

835
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,864
Are you now

836
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,168
Chicken that liability onto yourself

837
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
Adventure

838
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,240
The owner still liable

839
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,824
So there are some serious ramifications

840
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,872
Can switching out the door lock party

841
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,176
Not from an energy standpoint

842
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,968
It's a little looser

843
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,248
But at the same time

844
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:14,880
A lot of these building management systems or energy management systems that exist today

845
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Around 9

846
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
HVAC system

847
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,744
Won't interact well with a brand-new thermostat

848
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,072
These were installed 20-30 years ago

849
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
Sometime

850
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,632
So we're seeing a lot of conflict

851
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,472
Emma technology when renters try to put in something smart

852
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,496
Or something

853
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,264
Knox

854
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,336
I was going to say old and dumb let's say it

855
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,408
Boiler systems

856
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,944
Sometimes decades-old

857
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,016
Yes cuz you guys are based out in the North

858
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
Exactly

859
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,136
And despite the fact that we're installed in 45

860
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,672
State every single

861
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
State has its own

862
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,232
Boss

863
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,256
Around access

864
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,048
They have their own laws around energy

865
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,376
Around what the landlord is liable for

866
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,656
If there's no heat

867
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
Princeton

868
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,472
So these are pretty tremendous

869
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,824
Really obstacles to overcome in the space

870
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,872
Lived in apartment actually for

871
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
Fairly recently

872
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
Why you guys renovate at your house

873
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
Yeah

874
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,736
I think it was a nightmare

875
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,576
Just for the visual it's

876
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
3 kids

877
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,624
Two dogs

878
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
Myself and my husband

879
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,952
And an occasional nanny

880
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
In a three-bedroom apartment

881
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
Which is 18

882
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,352
Which is a huge apartment

883
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,680
But we were talking teenagers

884
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
So we have a

885
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:36,800
Ended beyond that in some pretty much the way from these are not small dog

886
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,080
30 pounders

887
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
This was

888
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,640
A learning curve for me

889
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
All over again

890
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,456
So during that

891
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,248
You actually said she came up with the

892
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,808
It sounds like about a dozen ideas for

893
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
Connected things

894
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
Was in the apartment

895
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,904
So I'd love to hear some of your ideas

896
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
And see what

897
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:58,560
People who rent can actually do in their Apartments even if their landlords aren't

898
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
Connecting thing

899
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
And he's maybe two.

900
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,424
No that's

901
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
A great question

902
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
Just

903
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,008
The ability of a cell

904
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,312
This is somewhat embarrassing but

905
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
I lost my

906
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,896
To the door the second day

907
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,432
We're moving in

908
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
Hectic

909
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,480
Life is crazy

910
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,784
I never lost my phone though

911
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Somebody call me

912
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:24,672
Google find my phone within 2 days

913
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:30,816
Lego Back to the leasing office at the Saturday there's maintenance person they're going to charge me $175

914
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,096
Painful

915
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,680
How old is Bruno $175

916
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:40,800
A nice apartment like I said it was a big one the only place we could all fit so there was

917
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,848
The ramifications

918
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,384
Really painful

919
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
And I thought you know

920
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,712
On my home

921
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,064
Just my phone why can't I do that and apartments and then I started thinking about the

922
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
Comparison

923
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,856
Paula Deen I thought

924
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,136
Starwood

925
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,672
Is moving towards best

926
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
Bluetooth

927
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
Prudential

928
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,792
Why can't we do that so it's really what started me thinking

929
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,608
You're the next thing I know

930
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,936
The washing machine and dryer inside the apartment break

931
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,520
And I have to go and use the community

932
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,544
Washer and dryer

933
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,616
No I'm washing clothes for 5 people

934
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,432
This is no small task if I did everyday

935
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,224
I would have multiple loads

936
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
So

937
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,880
I don't know that a lot of people outside of Apartments were called this even but I'm trying to

938
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,952
Watch my laundry in between

939
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,512
A dozen other people using that washer and dryer

940
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,304
There were multiple

941
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,352
But there was never a Time

942
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:40,192
When it was obviously and easily free and accessible

943
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,752
That's another thing that we can see with our app

944
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
When is the laundry open

945
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,336
How many people are in

946
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
Space

947
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,456
Beacon Technologies tremendous how many people are in the community center

948
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,760
Is this something I want to participate in

949
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
So

950
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,832
One thing led to another

951
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,160
And it became so obvious that an app

952
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,440
Four arrested

953
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,720
Living in the community

954
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,024
Could give me more information

955
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,304
10 even

956
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
A single-family home app

957
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,864
Do I have a package

958
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,448
Do I have a free washer and free dryer

959
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,520
Do I need to give access to an Airbnb guest

960
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,312
I mean things.

961
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,592
Go even Beyond

962
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,920
What's happening in single-family today I was surprised

963
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,736
And sometimes unfortunately so

964
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,784
To determine that there were a dozen

965
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,576
Additional use cases

966
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
For multifamily

967
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:30,880
That's awesome

968
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,416
Just makes your app

969
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
An offering soap

970
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
Hopefully better

971
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
About certain time

972
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
So what about

973
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
People who live in

974
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Prince today

975
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:43,936
I get emails every week from people who like I can

976
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,728
I guess I could do some light bulbs

977
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,056
Are there any other things

978
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
You know iot that

979
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,663
B on the go that can make apartment life a little less painful

980
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,967
Yeah so we love light bulbs

981
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,551
For this reason it's something you can take with you so you don't mind investing in it

982
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,623
We don't recommend investing in anything that becomes a fixture

983
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:06,719
In that apartment obviously so that includes the door locks and thermostats to your point

984
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,743
We are having a

985
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:08,767
Re-time

986
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,791
With

987
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
Google

988
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,095
And with Amazon

989
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,375
With their AI

990
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,679
Both home and Echo

991
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,471
Are tremendous devices

992
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,007
That will connect

993
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
Any device

994
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,079
What's the cost of a practical in disagree

995
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
Timer

996
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,871
Priority

997
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
If my 8 year old can use it

998
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
By all means give it a shot

999
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,319
Sounds good okay

1000
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,135
But you guys

1001
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,743
So with Z-Wave you can actually like make

1002
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,791
You could I could bring in like a SmartThings

1003
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:48,191
Controller for example in make my Apartments existing sensor system a secondary part of the earth SmartThings

1004
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,983
How the secondary controller for those things

1005
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,287
Absolutely

1006
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,823
Is that something that

1007
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,103
You think is a

1008
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,895
Bible Way Forward for people who aren't

1009
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
Nothing crazy like that

1010
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,711
I think it is

1011
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,271
And one of the things that I've enjoyed playing with

1012
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,087
Since I got into this space is the lamp module

1013
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,647
It seems obvious

1014
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,671
As a

1015
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:12,511
Tremendous part of what we're doing but you can plug anything into that

1016
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
Lights on off

1017
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:18,655
Since my curling iron because I am the person who's guilty of leaving it on

1018
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,935
I make sure it's off

1019
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,519
Simple easy iot play

1020
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,335
But anybody can do and you can plug in lamp

1021
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,127
You could plug in your radio

1022
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,431
I know who has the radio but you get my point

1023
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,991
You can plug in any device

1024
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:38,623
That can carry that load electrically so you want to plug your refrigerator into them obviously

1025
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:43,999
But that's a great opportunity to play with home automation in ways that are meaningful to the individual

1026
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,583
Write in an apartment you're going to lose out and take them with you when you move

1027
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
So.

1028
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
Opportunity

1029
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
It's a great one

1030
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:53,983
Anything you can plug in or screw in

1031
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
Go for it

1032
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
Got it

1033
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,311
Alright so

1034
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:01,919
What is the future for Seymour smart Apartments is this something that's

1035
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,967
People kind of

1036
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:08,063
Are apartment companies waiting to see what standards I don't know

1037
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,367
Yeah there's a lot of wait and see

1038
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,463
But with nearly a hundred and fifty thousand units installed

1039
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,999
If you can

1040
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,047
Count a real return on

1041
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
Much of the property owner

1042
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,863
The person who's paying for that

1043
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,911
Then they will buy

1044
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,471
Still looking for a return on investment

1045
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,239
Around

1046
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,007
2 years

1047
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:32,639
Anything longer than that and there's a lot of ambiguity in the future just like any real estate

1048
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:36,479
But if you can talk about it to your return on investment or exit

1049
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,247
Or energy

1050
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,551
And you're going for a smart building play

1051
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,343
That includes smart residence

1052
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
Then your integration

1053
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,927
If you're looking at the resident

1054
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,231
Then you're going to rely on Revenue list

1055
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,767
And that's a much harder sell

1056
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,327
Okay yes cuz I was wondering like

1057
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,959
Do you think people are willing to pay like 30 bucks extra a month or 40 bucks extra month for

1058
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,751
Automation in Access

1059
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,311
We are seeing Revenue list

1060
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,895
In Houston but which is a super-hot multifamily market

1061
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:09,247
We've left around it completely smart automated

1062
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,039
So this is access

1063
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:16,159
Is energy and this is at least one automation play which is typically a light switch

1064
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,951
Andorra bulk

1065
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:25,375
Fairly simple for you and me who have spent so much time and single-family but for

1066
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,167
Multifamily that's a serious play

1067
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,959
And so we are seeing

1068
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,751
You know 3540

1069
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
As much as

1070
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,799
60 on the West Coast

1071
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,079
Dollars a month

1072
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,431
No I don't rely on that because Market shift

1073
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,479
And certainly real estate market

1074
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,783
I'm sure today smart

1075
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
Tomorrow's news

1076
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,599
Exactly

1077
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,647
Something worth seeing

1078
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,231
In this industry and I anticipate it will continue today

1079
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,815
Differentiator you know this is a competitive differentiator

1080
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,863
Tomorrow it will be a competitive advantage

1081
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
Cars that are reliable

1082
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,423
2xist

1083
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,471
Pretty soon it'll be industry standard

1084
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,543
It will be the way that it is much for hospitality

1085
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,103
So

1086
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,455
What are the concerns around security and what do you have to do to harden

1087
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,759
Kind of especially for something like access

1088
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,039
The heart in that

1089
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,063
4

1090
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,879
Multi-family units because I can totally

1091
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,951
I have Bluetooth door locks

1092
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,255
Cisco shopping

1093
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:28,351
Yeah absolutely. Is something that is our primary focus

1094
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,935
So we have former googlers on our team focus on security

1095
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:34,239
People who have done this before careers

1096
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:37,823
Emma and I try to stress this with the most space especially

1097
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,103
Now you're not dealing with the

1098
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,407
Single-family home you're dealing with 300 home

1099
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,687
In one whack

1100
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,527
You have to be more cognizant and more careful

1101
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,831
Encryption is that much stronger

1102
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,927
And with that much more focused on the handshakes between devices

1103
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:58,047
It's what we spend most of our time on I had somebody on a panel the other day say

1104
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,143
You know what are they going to do you know hockey thermostat into what temperature it is

1105
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
But they see you and I know

1106
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,471
That's what happened at Target

1107
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,543
And they were on the hook for billions of dollars

1108
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:12,895
We can't be lackadaisical. Security it has to be foremost Focus

1109
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,431
Focus

1110
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,199
Anybody

1111
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:18,271
Trying to enter iot But specifically this space

1112
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
Where you have

1113
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,111
300 units under your control at a time

1114
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,391
It's that much more important

1115
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,927
Sure that's like

1116
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,231
300 potential MacBooks are television

1117
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,023
Exactly

1118
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,559
The Smart Home

1119
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
Single family

1120
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
Barely it

1121
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,423
Barely Main Street it's not mainstream

1122
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
It's like

1123
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,727
It's less than 10%

1124
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,007
Adoption rate so far

1125
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,311
So when I think about apartments

1126
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,895
Maybe the people are younger but do people come into this

1127
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:49,503
These apartments and they're like where's my keys so I'm going to use my what no

1128
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,295
So how is that process of

1129
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,343
Acclimating residents to

1130
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,111
Smarttech

1131
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,671
Yeah

1132
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:02,559
So there's definitely a learning curve bear as well sometimes I hear away already have a smart

1133
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,839
Apartment because I have

1134
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,119
Amazon's Echo

1135
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,167
What are you connecting not to

1136
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,215
Well I know the temperature outside

1137
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,031
Okay great but can you control your lighting

1138
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,823
Or do you know that your door is locked

1139
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,871
Or can you adjust your thermostat

1140
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:19,199
So there is an equivalent education happening

1141
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
In

1142
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,759
The multifamily space

1143
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,575
But it's happening 300

1144
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
Home to the time

1145
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,159
And that's a really significantly different

1146
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
Funny

1147
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,999
People are very accepting

1148
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,791
Smart access

1149
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,911
And Smart Energy in multifamily because they too can make that connection between

1150
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,959
Multifamily in hospitality

1151
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:44,287
Oh I use the smart potential at the hotel all the time

1152
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,335
Oh I use my phone

1153
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,615
Open my door at my hotel

1154
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,151
So there's

1155
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:49,919
I think

1156
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,199
I'm easier

1157
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:51,967
Time

1158
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,735
Poor education

1159
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,015
With multifamily

1160
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,807
Then an even single panel

1161
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,855
How do you have that conversation with

1162
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
Single-family home owner

1163
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,439
Is that on the floor of a retail establishment

1164
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:06,047
No our property owners and managers are having two conversations on our behalf

1165
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,327
I'm excited about

1166
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,631
Again because we focused. Return

1167
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,679
Vitamat owner

1168
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:14,239
So they're happy to tell you about your smartphone

1169
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,775
As a credential

1170
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,847
Or even a card you don't have to have a smartphone

1171
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,639
To have a smart apartment

1172
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:24,735
Oh that's good cuz I was just thinking of all those and I'm sure there's not that many

1173
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,759
But there are people who

1174
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,623
Aren't you know when my dad got a smartphone

1175
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:35,231
I kind of shifted my own thought I would like with my dad can use a smartphone

1176
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,535
He just doesn't love tok the way I do

1177
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,839
But when you got one

1178
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
I thought okay the

1179
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,887
Types of really

1180
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:46,751
We're really moving into a safe space for expectation

1181
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
Abusive

1182
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:53,151
So I'm not running too many people who don't have a smart device as a matter of fact

1183
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,175
Alyssa

1184
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:54,943
Surprise me

1185
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,247
We're finding Boomers

1186
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,551
Who are downsizing

1187
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,343
I'm moving into apartment

1188
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,135
And manage condo type

1189
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:03,903
Spaces

1190
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,695
To be equally

1191
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
Excited about this

1192
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,999
Is technology

1193
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,791
There's often times

1194
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
Fixed income

1195
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,863
And they're really cognizant

1196
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,423
Who they love

1197
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,703
To use their phone

1198
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,239
To adjust the thermostat

1199
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,519
They check up on each other

1200
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,151
Honey did you you know turn the thermostat down or we're going on vacation

1201
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:28,479
So wishing Boomers is excited about this technology

1202
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,551
MLB family and even Assisted Living

1203
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,831
As we are millennial

1204
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,623
That's really surprising

1205
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
That's pretty cool

1206
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,975
Awesome

00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,559
