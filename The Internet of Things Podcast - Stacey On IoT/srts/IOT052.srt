00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,016
How is that was different London last week

And this is all part of your new digs

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,208
Will Abbey Road Studios was not part of the tour

13
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:36,096
Yes I do have a new gig and actually just announced today that they were recording the show

14
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,936
I am going to be will know I am I am working for Google

15
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,728
Of all places the Google

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,032
I can't really say what I'm doing though

17
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,312
Obviously.

18
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,640
But yes I was in London at a Google event

19
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
Last week

20
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,456
And that's how it's not on the show and I hear that you had

21
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,504
Mr. Mike Wolfe a former colleague of ours

22
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,552
I did we talked about all kinds of fun

23
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,344
So cool

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
Some of the topics will be Revisited

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,928
Robotic bartender

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,464
Weather

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,232
Alcohol

28
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,536
This week

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
We got to talk about the stuff

30
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,424
Kevin's going to be very clear about what

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,496
We're going to be talking about some drama

32
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,056
August doorbell camera

33
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,152
Amazon

34
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,832
As always skip

35
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,392
The group called I Am the calvary and they're releasing

36
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,720
Recommendations for security in the Smart Home

37
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,280
If security is your back

38
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,560
Love those folks

39
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,584
I do too

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
I don't know how loud it is cuz I've never done a place on there in like this but yes that was my Plus

41
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
StubHub

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
Golf Club

43
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
Nest

44
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
So Thursday

45
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
AR podcast

46
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
A website called the information

47
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
Publish the story that

48
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:01,344
Wow Dropped a Bomb It talked about

49
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,160
And had an interview with Tony fadell the CEO of nest

50
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,488
The Exodus of over 500 employees

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
Abbott company

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
Why

53
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
Nest has not managed to

54
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
Introduce new

55
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
Products in the two years that

56
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,472
It's been since Google has purchased it

57
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
And

58
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,312
Kind of laid bare a management style that is

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
I don't know how would you describe it

60
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
You know

61
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
An anesthesiologist

62
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,832
Stop people clearer I don't know anything about this internally at Google so this is just speculation and observational

63
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
Answer your question

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,928
Barely controlling

65
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,488
Turley controlling and mean

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Tony fadell came from Apple

67
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Which

68
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,328
Controller

69
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
Standard operating procedure

70
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,704
Tight controls over Hardware software and messaging you know messaging about

71
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
About products and such

72
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
And

73
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
It's a

74
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,360
Based on the information story

75
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,688
N3ver pretty solid now that's I don't I don't doubt

76
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
Their sources or anything

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
Seems like

78
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
Maybe things are too controlling over there I don't know

79
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,744
And seeing people leaving from nest for quite some time

80
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
Fortunate

81
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,560
Didn't have a

82
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
The access

83
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
These guys got with

84
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,936
But also didn't have

85
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
The time

86
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Delve into this but

87
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Men

88
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,080
I have no reason to doubt the story because it

89
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
Chives completely with

90
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
So

91
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,944
I would also say

92
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
From

93
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
All of this

94
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,808
There's a couple lessons we should probably take from the

95
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
1

96
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
Explains to me totally

97
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,208
Why they're two totally different protocols called weave

98
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,048
One from Google it went from gas because it sounds like the people at Google

99
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,096
Are not really working with the people

100
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Add nest

101
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,704
There's a little anecdote in there that Google is building an Amazon Echo

102
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,728
Type device

103
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
And

104
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,848
The Nest team was like hey we want in on that and the Google team was like

105
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
No thanks

106
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
So

107
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
That feels pretty damn

108
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,016
The other two this was

109
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
The Dropcam part

110
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
And that's kind of a surprising to hear who who is the person over there it's Greg Duffy

111
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
Yeah

112
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
Nest purchase Dropcam about

113
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
6 months

114
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
After

115
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Google hit purchase nest

116
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
And it kind of lump those two together

117
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
Basically

118
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
When

119
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:33,919
Greg Duffy the CEO of Dropcam left everyone was kind of shocked and there were rumors

120
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
Nast wanted to put out this video camera

121
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,063
Hated working there

122
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,903
People are crying and working out

123
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,975
And now for the information story

124
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,535
Actually talk to them and explained

125
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
A lot of things

126
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
Like ghetto

127
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
How Tony fadell

128
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
Treated him maybe not

129
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
How someone who

130
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,263
Had previously run a company would want to be treated

131
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
And then on Tuesday

132
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,871
Duffy actually posted

133
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
Something on medium that said

134
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,199
Hey that story

135
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,503
I just want to say that my employees for great

136
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,343
Has Tony fadell had insulted the Dropcam employees in the story

137
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
And

138
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,439
He went further and said that most of successes

139
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,279
From the previous earnings report we're actually Dropcam successes

140
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
Seems like a pretty big

141
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,631
A grenade a lot in the middle of this fight

142
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
It's getting ugly

143
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:31,007
And I don't know if we're going to continue or not I hope it doesn't but

144
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:35,359
Pieces of the story are you right lobbing grenades and and it's just not not pretty

145
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,175
It does show though how tough it is

146
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
To make

147
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
A smart home device

148
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
Tony fadell has for years

149
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,623
Been a proponent of the intuitive and responsive home

150
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:53,279
As opposed to everybody else who's trying to pitch these like programmatic homes where your like I will tell my lights to turn off at 10

151
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,863
Adele's version has always been that he wants

152
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
Your device is to react to you

153
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
Ness was very much part of that

154
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
I think so

155
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,823
Ask the space kind of heat it up

156
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
It became more and more difficult

157
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
Control all of that

158
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Because

159
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
Credit score

160
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
Nest can't be a plateau

161
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:17,855
It has to be an ecosystem and I think it's hard for someone who's that controlling to open up and let that happen

162
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:23,743
And then we talked about this before I'm into to your point about it but it's difficult to make a device these days

163
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,095
There's so much changes going on between protocols and

164
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:34,239
Radio technology and dealing with people's privacy and security issues which are certainly valid

165
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,079
Nnn opening things up to third-party developers do you or don't you

166
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,871
How do you do it if you're going to do it

167
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:46,271
This is not a revolution that's going to happen in a short amount of time and I know that sounds obvious because innocence Stacy you and I been watching it going

168
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
One for several years now

169
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
But this

170
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,183
Really does speak to the difficulty of it and why things

171
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Tornados

172
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
Quick as they could be

173
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,303
You got people such as a apple who are

174
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
Want to control everything

175
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
Down to the security chip inside

176
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,935
There's so many moving parts

177
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,263
And everybody wants to that to control a known bits of it

178
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
It's very very

179
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
Frustrating

180
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,383
Incredibly and I would say that I would love it to be

181
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
More like the internet

182
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:19,039
Common protocols everybody works together but it's so far

183
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
And that's why we're going to always have these

184
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
Bridge services

185
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
Services like

186
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:29,279
If this then that or you thinking

187
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,071
That's an awesome Segway

188
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
So what

189
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Talk about what

190
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
What's happening with

191
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Send that

192
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:40,799
I'm saying again because now it's more of a kind of bad news so to speak

193
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,335
Coming up Delaware

194
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
So here's what happened

195
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:48,479
A service called pinboard which is owned and created by one developer

196
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,039
Social bookmarking for introverts

197
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
Attack something you favorite something and

198
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,951
Are you save it for later like any article or what you like on the web

199
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
Cost 11 bucks a year

200
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,559
It's a cool service a lot of people apparently love it

201
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
And what happened was

202
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
A post

203
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,471
When if this then that said hey

204
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,543
You know your ifta integration is going to break

205
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
On April 4th

206
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,663
And if you wanted to keep working

207
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,991
You're going to have to develop something with the new code that were release

208
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
And the developer was like

209
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:29,439
And then I guess she had some back and forth with it to send that because a second post that went up

210
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
I believe on Monday

211
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
And it got some play

212
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
It was like

213
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,887
Yeah so here's all the things I find wrong with this so

214
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
And I think it's because his users were like

215
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,519
Hey if two saying our stuff is going to break what's happening

216
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
And basically this is a tough

217
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Because

218
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,407
Totally right in saying

219
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Yeah

220
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,039
I think it's great that you did this integration of my service so many years ago

221
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:00,415
Now that you want me to develop it for you because you're turning that perfectly fine working one-off

222
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
I'm just not going to do it

223
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
I totally get that

224
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:10,143
I do too and you know it Services mature and change and then there's infrastructure changes to make things better or not

225
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
Presume that's what's happening

226
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,215
With if this than that but

227
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
I'm looking at the

228
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,567
The note from the pinboard developer notes

229
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:23,455
Sites that want to work with if this then that will have to implement a private API that can change without warning now

230
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:29,599
You know it says I'm all for glue Services big and small and I think I would if this then that is to Glucerna as it's great you can put

231
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647
Bug pieces in and make things work together

232
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:37,279
And he says it's better for the weather they connect a stable document public apis rather than custom private ones

233
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
I get that in a minutes

234
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:43,167
That's the ideal that's kind of part of that whole ecosystem effort worth

235
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,775
Founder of if this then that

236
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
And

237
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
I was like

238
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
Linden

239
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,663
Here a couple questions I have for you one of which was what's up with this

240
00:09:54,175 --> 00:10:00,319
He responded that he says we are working with pinboard to find the right steps are in tension

241
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:05,183
Platform rather we want to do everything we can to help Partners take ownership of their Channel improve it over time

242
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
But in his argument is

243
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
And his statement

244
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,399
We simply cannot maintain improve and make each of these channels great without the help of the services themselves

245
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:20,287
We could have done a much better job in communicating this desire for change in ownership with both pinboard and are user

246
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,359
So he said they have over 300 channels on it

247
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Bissonnet today

248
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,967
They want to have thousands and they can't support this without

249
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
People's help

250
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
Doubt

251
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,647
There's some stuff in in the post about the developer terms of service where

252
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
Basically all of the data

253
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
If this and that

254
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,839
Looking out with this actually

255
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,959
Personal like the consumer terms and services

256
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,775
It looks like

257
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
If the sin that takes my data

258
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
And it puts

259
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:00,991
Information about me and all the things that I'm using with that it's stores all that information in a folder

260
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
Is personally identifiable

261
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
They say they don't share it

262
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
Unless they've got

263
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,511
Law enforcement or legal processes which I believe

264
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
A civil case

265
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,143
Eeyore when it's necessary to do so to protect the rights and property

266
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Or others

267
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
In the same terms and conditions it says

268
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:30,431
Quote we may share our data including personal information about you with our partners and joint ventures in furtherance of our business

269
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
That's a little contradictory

270
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,599
Yeah and I asked Lyndon about that and he didn't actually respond to that

271
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
So

272
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
Yeah

273
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:48,351
You don't they have to monetize in for the last year-and-a-half they've been working with

274
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
Third parties seoul

275
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,239
Comedies like pinboard except companies that want to be associated with if

276
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,055
And they've been making those companies develop their own

277
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
API Integrations.

278
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
So

279
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,199
It's been something that's been happening for a while

280
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:10,367
The fact that they're going to turn off the freeway or the early versions that they built up to like establish the platform

281
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Users

282
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
It's kind of WhatsApp setting

283
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:17,023
That's upsetting as well as I do and I don't know the answer this question but I'm wondering how much

284
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,583
Advance notice that they gave to certain people

285
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,887
You know cuz April 4th is right around the corner

286
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,423
That's true

287
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
It was on Twitter when it received the letter he started to

288
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
In which case that's not enough time

289
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
No

290
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,919
Okay so he received a letter this week and they're shutting it down basically

291
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
Yeah that's that's

292
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Okay so

293
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:45,695
Don't have a lot of conclusions there it looks like if they spend that is doing

294
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
Services

295
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:53,119
In a with a developer Community to make themselves exciting for end-users and then they kind of switch the terms because I've got to make

296
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,471
You put the plumbing in place let people use it and then you turn off the spicket

297
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
So

298
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,799
Not good not good so we'll stay tuned

299
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
We'll come back to this

300
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,431
Issue again especially with the user terms because I really would like to know

301
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
WhatsApp

302
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
My data

303
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
Undecim

304
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
Better stuff

305
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
August doorbell

306
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,903
Camera

307
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
And

308
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
What you think

309
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,215
I like it like this doorbell since I saw it way back in December and thought I was going to

310
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Get it back in

311
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:38,175
But it's good some of the reviewer say it's too big for the door frame and it is it's a big Square

312
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,479
I know you got a skinny space so you may not go for it

313
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
Yeah I do

314
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,063
But I can tell you it will not fit in

315
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,879
I'm sure we'll fit many people store so

316
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:52,255
It'll fit for me and it came with a mounting block because my doorbell is not on the same wall as

317
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
The door is ajar

318
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
Catty corner

319
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
It's none of the above

320
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,239
In which case is probably a good solution you going to see the side of the person

321
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
Facing the door I presume

322
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
What they do is they make these little mounts that

323
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,663
Can't it out at like a 45 degree angle

324
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,479
Is August is the only one of all the doorbells that actually

325
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
It comes with one

326
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Which

327
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,831
It's very easy to install

328
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,879
A lot of people and I'll just say this

329
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
Don't be afraid to take your doorbell off

330
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,023
And install one of these doorbells it's about a 15-minute operation

331
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,839
And I have a stucco house so

332
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
You know I'm talking about drilling into the Mesa

333
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,799
You know she may not need new holes you are if you're doing Bricker

334
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
Stucco candidate the little anchor bolts

335
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
It's so easy you guys

336
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,759
And and yes there's some wiring to connect but it's so negligible

337
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:51,135
Give me the wiring essentially I got some beaches for power it's it's actually capturing video and such

338
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
Over life I assume

339
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,767
Yes yeah so you're not you're not wiring a video feed

340
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Innocence you just wiring another

341
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
Essential another doorbell

342
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:08,031
So if people are cuz I know some people are like one install a little bit higher someone for like a hundred bucks in them

343
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,895
And it's not just because I am handicapped

344
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
You just take off your doorbell nuc

345
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
You have another doorbell

346
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
You're going to want to

347
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,439
$199

348
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,535
It has a wonderful HD camera

349
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,911
Unlike the others this has more of a square view as opposed to the long way

350
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
Landscape View

351
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
You can see

352
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
So clearly during the day at night

353
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:46,175
Maybe not as good of quality is the skybell at night but I found that it's a little bit more

354
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
Reliable

355
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:52,575
On the notification side making sure that when something happens

356
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,159
It let you know and then it's faster to load

357
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Wichita

358
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,023
It took about two seconds to resolve

359
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
The video feed when I'm in the house

360
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Not bad

361
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:11,519
There's no service or anything that you have to pay for them no monthly Fabian the only reason I ask is because it will actually eat fabric

362
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,311
Call record every single

363
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
Interaction and you can reply those

364
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,431
Is the cloud service isn't setup

365
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,759
He's coming back right now

366
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,063
It it does not have anything like that

367
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
There's no fee associated

368
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
Tulelake

369
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
See a certain like

370
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
Up to a certain time

371
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Birthdays

372
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
History

373
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:37,631
Catch up yet I bet they will have that okay I see it now coming soon and then August app update

374
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,935
Animal Crossing

375
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Beautiful

376
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
Well

377
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
The service

378
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
30 days worth

379
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
Is that make sense

380
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,551
Got you okay I'll have to go look and let you guys know but

381
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,575
I know that

382
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,391
The ring doorbell you can actually download videos

383
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
From the doorbell and store them yourself

384
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
So that is pretty handy

385
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,583
If you have a ring you may already know

386
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,935
August doorbell cam

387
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,751
I'm excited I think it's the most beautiful of all the doorbell

388
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
Just for my

389
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Pretty person

390
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
Yeah no design it's beautiful

391
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
So that is that other things

392
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,223
That we talked about in the oven

393
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
Oh you love the June oven

394
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,087
I did I think it's such a fun idea to have like a I-4

395
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
Expertise

396
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
Internet of things makes you an expert

397
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
Without actually having to be

398
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
So

399
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,535
Kevin you want to say what's going on there

400
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,935
So the company has raised an additional 22 and 1/2 million dollars in 5

401
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Financing

402
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,007
And for those who are not familiar with the junit

403
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:52,383
I I like this description on on TechCrunch cuz I know I've said it before deposits like an easy bake oven for grown-ups

404
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Some

405
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,455
It's going to cost you $1,500

406
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,015
So why they raised more money

407
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,927
Did Ashley delay this the launch of this is well yeah it was actually in June

408
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,975
Now it's going to come out

409
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
In the court

410
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Holiday time

411
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,583
That's a big change

412
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
So here something's

413
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,495
What they're trying to do here is they replace like the typical oven light

414
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
Inside the oven

415
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:24,383
So that like incandescent kind of style light that you got with nmds

416
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
Put

417
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,711
Sensors in the feet of the oven

418
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,503
They've also put a GPU in a

419
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
Camera

420
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:37,439
Inside so I did a camera inside the oven so it can look at the food in the gpus to do kind of machine learning

421
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,999
So I can say like

422
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
I'm going to totally

423
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,095
You know cook it this long so you don't have to

424
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Know how to cook

425
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
A pork chop

426
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:51,007
In talking to people in the home appliance business sole kit Electrolux

427
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
Whirlpool

428
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,591
Whenever I ask him about that they were like

429
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,687
Yeah you know putting LEDs inside of an oven environment is super

430
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
Hard

431
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
And

432
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
Some of the stuff they were trying to do any

433
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,855
A camera inside the environment is also super hard

434
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,927
Just to do at production scale

435
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:13,023
So what I'm wondering is if they kind of realized that

436
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,839
What they're attempting maybe a little bit

437
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
They swallowed more than they can chew

438
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,239
That's possible in an animal so wondering I mean

439
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,335
The idea behind us as the oven will actually know what you put in it

440
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,175
So it's not like you to say I'm cooking a pork chop

441
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
What you just said

442
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,223
And I wonder

443
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,783
Algorithmically are they having challenges there as well

444
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,087
I'm in stitches. Vast array of

445
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,135
Foods

446
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,719
Yeah but that mean with machine learning and deep-learning

447
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
That doesn't feel as in

448
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Intimidating to me

449
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
The actual

450
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Stuff they're trying

451
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,727
And if you think about putting a semiconductor

452
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,591
Oven work

453
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
So I mean

454
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
I don't know

455
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
What they're doing is hard

456
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
It's worth

457
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:09,855
In their defense and along the lines of what you're saying the challenges maybe they did say they said in the statement

458
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,975
That they decided to work with new manufacturing partners for Plastics and cosmetics sheet metal

459
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
So

460
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,583
It could be supply chain issues could be proud of challenges

461
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
At least partially

462
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,679
The reason why this is being delayed

463
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
So there we go

464
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,287
Cuz I really want to try this

465
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,591
I hope you get a review Winnetka

466
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
$1,500 for this

467
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
Probably here

468
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,783
Let's talk about what we

469
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,087
$1,500

470
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Was it $90

471
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,463
89 99 plus tax

472
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
So

473
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,767
Before the show

474
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
Kevin and I both

475
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,863
Received our emails from Amazon

476
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,751
If an arriving Thursday on time

477
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
Right

478
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,103
Is the smaller version of the Amazon Echo

479
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,663
It doesn't have the full speaker in it but should

480
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
Presumably have all the other fan

481
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
You'll hear more about that

482
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Thursday

483
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,391
And we actually talked about the other Prophet came out with about the Amazon tap

484
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:20,000
And you got an email from a listener and it you know it

485
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,072
Shame on me for not making the very good point that he made

486
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:28,192
Yes so Joseph episode

487
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728
First portability

488
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
Like all for it

489
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,800
And then second

490
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,592
Never wanted it

491
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,640
Echo to creeping her opinion

492
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
Because it's always

493
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,992
Teacher is a great choice for our home

494
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,296
That's a really valid point I'm in

495
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,112
Some people don't like the always listening function

496
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,696
That's in the Amazon Echo today and the tap

497
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:56,096
Doesn't have that you press the button when you want to listen and I remember saying that that take some of the magic out of it for me

498
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,936
But some people are fine with that they rather give up that magic and

499
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,008
Be safe and secure knowing it's not always listening so

500
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
It's a really smart

501
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
Smart observation

502
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,128
So yashow he's keeping his wife happy

503
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
And he's one of the

504
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,456
Yes

505
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
Now we know who those people are

506
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Apparently

507
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,600
It was a no-show so they can't be all bad

508
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,720
Also from

509
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
Amazon

510
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,328
Is this week actually marks the anniversary of the Amazon Dash

511
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
Which

512
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,424
We we don't talk about the much but those are the buttons

513
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
Physical button

514
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
Fix the things

515
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Like

516
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,592
Your washing machine washing machine

517
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
And you just press it

518
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
Order

519
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:46,528
A new product there specific for one product so a tide Dash

520
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
Only order you knew

521
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
Tides

522
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
From Amazon

523
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
So to me it feels like

524
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,464
Like a lesser cousin of the dash

525
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
Assume that service which I think is suica Google

526
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,328
It has like censored

527
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
In orders at 1

528
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
Texture Olmos

529
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
Stout that's awesome

530
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,448
That I like that I like

531
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,264
Like this this is nothing more to me than just moving the one

532
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,848
Click buy button off your phone or tablet and put it on your physical device

533
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:15,200
People like it because Amazon is announcing over a hundred new button

534
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
So

535
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,552
Imagine how cluttered your home could be

536
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,952
I'll check the new buns maybe I mean if there's some product

537
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
Maybe

538
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
But

539
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
I don't know

540
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
We'll see

541
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,096
And usually the way Amazon has done it and

542
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
Previous year

543
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
Has been

544
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
By the button

545
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,984
For like for 99 and then you get a credit off of your

546
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,776
First order us whatever it is

547
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
So

548
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,872
They cost money but

549
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
Do you get it back

550
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
Do you want to talk about

551
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,272
Well yeah I mean that's something I would reward

552
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:55,392
It's something I wish I had a button for redelivery

553
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,184
Yeah you you actually

554
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,000
Tune me into this something smart

555
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
Wine bottle

556
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
It's called a Cuvee

557
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:06,656
And I've never heard of this before but it is a wifi-connected bottle

558
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:11,776
The bottle is not cheap I think it's $180 if you pre-order

559
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,080
Hundred dollars

560
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,128
And you can use it to actually

561
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
Order

562
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,760
Refills of wine that will retail between 15 and $50

563
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:26,112
So it's it's wifi-connected I didn't see how you do the reorder thing

564
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,648
Doesn't sense it

565
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
Do you have sensors in the bottle

566
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:34,304
And I know you're supposed to go to the website and pick out the bottles that you

567
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,632
So they're going to do a recommendation

568
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,936
Service kind of Amazon

569
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,752
Well Amazon Netflix those kind of companies

570
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,776
So it'll

571
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
Take your taste into account

572
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
So

573
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,152
If you find a way to order

574
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,688
You can actually order it directly

575
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,528
The bottle 100% sure how that would work

576
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
Matching you have to decide like

577
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,368
Like I really like this one particular

578
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
1

579
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,952
Fresco

580
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Right

581
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
I think

582
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,096
It's an interesting delivery model is like the razor

583
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
The razor blade model for

584
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
The Internet of Things

585
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,264
In this case the razor is like

586
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,592
Too expensive

587
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,016
It's interesting how we're seeing a shift towards the ordering process in the purchase of things with with iot

588
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,320
Not buying it what she thinks of buying everyday things

589
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Biote

590
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:35,488
And we just talked about the dash buttons this is kind of similar to literally order the wine right from the wine bottle the reusable

591
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,560
Wine bottle which actually keep your wine fresh for up to a month as well so

592
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:45,472
I think we're seeing is I mean this is a totally legitimate business model but I think was going to end up happening is we'll see

593
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
Subsidizing

594
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
In device

595
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,848
After a certain point so what we're going to do

596
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
Get is

597
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
Companies that

598
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:57,248
Maybe cheaper version

599
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,808
It's got sensors it's got the

600
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Pre-ordering

601
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
And it's also

602
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,648
Has to be like vacuum sealable

603
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,184
Gear whine

604
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
So

605
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,768
That could be incredibly expensive and not

606
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
We're subsidizing

607
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
I really think

608
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Example

609
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
Coffee maker

610
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,728
Like a Keurig or something

611
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,008
Is connected

612
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,848
Mr. coffee connected

613
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,896
Peacemaker and then they do deals with

614
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
Ghetto folders in

615
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,416
I agree and it and it takes away a lot of activity from

616
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,976
What smartphones and tablets and computers and

617
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
Put it where you

618
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,328
Never you want and use those products

619
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
You know

620
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,680
And the challenge will just be getting the hardware cheap enough

621
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,240
And getting people comfortable enough

622
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,568
With the business model that the manufacturers of these products will be

623
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Comfortable subsidizing

624
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:59,200
I'll be curious to see how that works cuz even like right now with the Amazon Dash

625
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,016
I haven't ordered any because when I look at Amazon I'm like

626
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,832
And their pricing for toilet paper is way too expensive

627
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
Like

628
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
Take away my ability

629
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
To choose

630
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
For me

631
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
Prices kind

632
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,560
Trump's convenience there

633
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:19,168
Confirm much of America that's probably still

634
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
McKay's

635
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960
I could be wrong

636
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,776
I would say so but I think over time

637
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,592
Millennials growing up in Saint convenience lb

638
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,408
More about purchasing decision

639
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
Yeah and you know

640
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:37,344
Procter & Gamble is doing the experiment connected Febreze

641
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
Plugins

642
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,184
And they're actually

643
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,280
Experimenting with this model intent of selling Febreze has

644
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,352
I don't think they're selling it directly to the app yet but that is their plan

645
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,288
Pay anything to sell more products

646
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
More stuff

647
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,872
So while you're drinking your wine

648
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,152
Connected

649
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,480
I would love for you guys to do us both a favor

650
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,272
And our survey

651
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,320
So it's very short survey

652
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
2 minutes maybe if you had most

653
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
At most

654
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,768
Go to ww.w. Iot podcast. Com

655
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048

662
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:37,248
With the Atlantic Council and recommendations

663
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
The smartphone

664
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,296
Yay

665
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:45,696

I'm doing so well so thank you for coming on the podcast this week

676
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:36,384
You guys have some really exciting news and by exciting I mean

677
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
Slightly terrifying

678
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:41,248
So let's talk about what you're doing

679
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
New release today

680
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
Port on

681
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,368
Security and the Smart Home

682
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
Smart Home Security

683
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
Security in the

684
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,464
Home-based Internet of Things

685
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,792
I'm so we looked at a handful of different segments

686
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,072
Of the

687
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,352
Smart home environment

688
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,168
Those three being home utilities

689
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,240
Things like power on electric gas

690
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,776
Metering systems

691
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,080
Things where you could potentially save money

692
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
Is by using Spark

693
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
Home devices

694
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,712
We also looked at a home appliances things like fridges

695
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
Laundry machine

696
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,576
Your internet-connected toaster or sous-vide maker

697
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:20,416
And then Internet connected or Internet of Things

698
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,464
Security and safety devices

699
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
Baby monitors

700
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
Surveillance video cameras

701
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,608
And other things that you buy to make your home

702
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,912
Safer and more secure for yourself in your family

703
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:35,264
The exciting thing about this and why you're on the show this week is because

704
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,336
You're part of a group called I Am the cavalry

705
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:44,992
Which is kind of this security researchers working with government and working with industry establishing these framework

706
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,296
Parts for connected devices for securing connect

707
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
Two devices

708
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,624
And you guys did one on the automobile

709
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,184
Is now done with the FDA on

710
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,000
Medical devices connected medical devices

711
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,584
And this report is the precursor to one on the smartphone

712
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,912
Yeah it's

713
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
Distinct

714
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,960
But not unrelated

715
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
It's so

716
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,568
I am the Cavalry free stock round is like

717
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,128
Set a group of security researchers

718
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,968
Animal eyes that are dependents on connected technology

719
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,016
Is going faster than are billions

720
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,040
Sure that technology

721
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,112
I so particularly where that comes to

722
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,160
Human life and Public Safety

723
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,184
Type devices

724
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,232
Such as automobiles

725
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,536
Medical devices Smart Homes

726
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,840
Public infrastructure

727
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
Planes

728
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
Trains

729
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,656
Public Utilities

730
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,728
And now this report fits into that fairly well

731
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,288
Although it's not directly a

732
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
I am the cavalry

733
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,360
Framework document

734
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,896
It certainly has a lot of this

735
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,176
Hallmark San Marcos

736
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,736
I particularly need some of the recommendations

737
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,040
I see a lot of familiar faces in there

738
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,856
Edit can be used it as we

739
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,184
In the future work on a iot framework

740
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,720
For cyber safety

741
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,536
Let's go into that because your recommendations

742
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:06,656
Your first recommendation which is security by Design is something people talked about for never

743
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,704
And it's also like

744
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,104
I feel like it's the bare minimum but it's also like basically the standard that a lot of the connected device makers are actually kind of trying to

745
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,152
To get to today as opposed to like

746
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,200
4 years ago when they started building these things

747
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,248
So

748
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,624
That talks about I mean the basic assumption and I will include in the show notes a link to this document every

749
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,928
The basic assumption is that you

750
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,256
Assume that there going to be people trying to attack your device

751
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
So you heard me

752
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,584
You continually test it

753
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,216
He's crazy tremendous like lines of code so you can avoid

754
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,544
You making overly complicated devices with lots of Entry

755
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
It's basically

756
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:51,712
From there you go on and you talk about third-party collaboration which I read is bug bounties or at least not suing people who brings

757
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,504
Security issues to you right

758
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
You guys are appropriate funny

759
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,856
Well work with Pro don't see people who are trying to help you

760
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,672
I think is a better way to think of it

761
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,768
And then you've got seven more and we'll probably talk about most of them

762
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,888
But how are some of these different for the smart home then for automotive and medical devices

763
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,960
One of the major ways in which

764
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,520
Smart Homes environment is different than

765
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,800
Vices and Automobiles

766
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,104
Is that their candy

767
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,384
Allure consequence

768
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
Also

769
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,712
You look at some of the economic

770
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,272
I'm smart homes versus medical devices

771
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
Albertsons

772
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
Auto deals

773
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:32,160
You've got a lot of really small Kickstarter size projects

774
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:35,488
That are maybe 10:50 hundred dollars

775
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
Smart home space

776
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,072
There's not a lot of room

777
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,608
To add on different

778
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,656
Siri features are security measures

779
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:46,752
I told you a lot of other things so particularly with the two that you identify

780
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
Security by Design

781
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,592
Third-party collaboration

782
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,128
Those are things that

783
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,200
Reduce the need for external dependencies

784
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,760
To ensure security of the device itself

785
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,064
At the same time that there are

786
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,648
Septic tank on the kickstarter side projects for Internet of Things

787
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,208
They're also Kickstarter size projects

788
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,256
Security platform

789
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
That would be Edition

790
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
2

791
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,376
Internet of Things Smart Homes devices

792
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,168
Not where you started

793
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,728
You kind of the model as we have in corporate it

794
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,544
Let's buy a system

795
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,568
And then

796
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,128
Layer security defenses around it

797
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,920
In and out of this cost model

798
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,992
None of those things that really doesn't look for a number of reasons

799
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,064
Main ones doing that the others know how am I

800
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,624
Also if

801
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,928
Consumers are going to have to buy additional things

802
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,488
You're probably not going to buy the additional

803
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,072
So you'll just have insecure devices that

804
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
Ashley click

805
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
I am third

806
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,984
Consumers believe that these devices are not inherently secure

807
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,032
Dental inducer prices

808
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Confidence

809
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,824
The Titans

810
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,152
Or people are very very hesitant to accept

811
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,968
And other things connected devices in their homes

812
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,528
Okay let's go back to your number two point

813
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,808
Because it's worth teasing a

814
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:09,184
But I think you're about as the pain of the system's nature of the Internet of Things in the Smart Home

815
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,072
Which is I might buy a hub from one vendor and then connected to other products is that kind of what you were talking about

816
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,096
Yeah you buy

817
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:19,424
Some type of a hug from one day vendor connect to the other products

818
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
You might also have

819
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,800
Something more like a mesh Network or different things connected

820
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,848
Lost my talk

821
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,176
Q but it might not talk to Alexa for instance

822
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:35,296
Got it so that's just not as effective but unfortunately that's how we're setting up a lot of Arkansas

823
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
Times right now

824
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
That's right

825
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,392
It's less effective the tire cost

826
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
Tire maintenance

827
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,696
That's it requires a

828
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
High degree of expert

829
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,256
What to use on the purchaser

830
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,328
And ultimately I think you're seeing some of the effects of bad and

831
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,376
Alexander reluctance to buy some

832
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,936
Set the devices are to use expected futures

833
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:56,544
Because people don't quite understand it and they don't feel like they are masters of that demand

834
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,616
Nor should they have to be in order to use a

835
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
In order refrigerator

836
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,432
Baidu security for a living

837
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
And yet

838
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
I would be hard-pressed

839
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,784
To adequately secure my fridge

840
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,368
Norwood I really want to spend the time securing it

841
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,024
And I'm with you I've got 40 semi connected devices in my house and I am like 100% sure that if someone wanted to

842
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,120
They can totally take them over I'm living totally in this Blissful security by obscurity

843
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
I probably shouldn't admit

844
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
But

845
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,360
That makes sense and we'll get to kind of demand for these but I did want to continue going through some of your recommendations first kiss

846
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,896
You got some really good ones

847
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,064
So the to that kind of really strong like struck a chord with me with the date of protective measures in the informed consent

848
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,880
For data usage because most people can see that

849
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,672
The Internet of Things is about

850
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
Getting data

851
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
And then

852
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,792
Glean insights from that data whether it's

853
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,608
For the company itself weathers for the user

854
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,704
We currently have an issue where a lot of people

855
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:02,592
Aren't just worried about their security other devices they're worried about the privacy of their data and these kind of points

856
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,152
Bring that up so I'm curiously

857
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,688
Why these are in here

858
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,712
How do you really

859
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,272
Sorry I mean

860
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,064
Like you said it's

861
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
Data privacy

862
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:18,464
Is one of the biggest issues with a Chinese consumer devices from the consumer

863
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,744
Perspective

864
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,280
ISO

865
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,840
A commitment to preserving

866
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,632
The agreed-upon trust

867
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,216
That consumers have with the companies that they buy these things from

868
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:34,080
I think it's really important it's a signaling mechanism to the company or to Consumers

869
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
That we value

870
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,920
Your privacy as much as you do

871
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,712
For whatever varying level

872
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,760
I'd agree that you don't value it

873
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,088
And what's one of the things that we call I get to hear is

874
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
It's not necessarily a binary

875
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,672
Privacy or no privacy

876
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,000
That is not necessarily A trade-off that everyone will agree on

877
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
I'm certainly

878
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,352
Facebook doesn't have the same views as

879
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,888
Odyssey

880
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,168
Diverse Power

881
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,960
They just never will agree

882
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
But

883
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
If you can set up the

884
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,056
Some situation in which

885
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,360
The company in the individual

886
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,920
Can together jointly negotiate

887
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,456
That data privacy

888
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,784
I think that's a really good point to be able to get to

889
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,320
And if we can

890
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,136
Cuz decouple some of the business model

891
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
Consumer value

892
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
Then we can start

893
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,512
See you there

894
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,536
Will having a

895
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,328
Your privacy conversation

896
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,864
Call Nat individual

897
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:29,888
Level

898
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
Kimberly payoff

899
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,776
If you have the ability when you're going into user device

900
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,824
To say I just

901
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,640
I want to be able to have this level of day to you sir

902
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,968
Or I want to be able to agree any time

903
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,016
You want to hand over

904
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,808
This data to third party

905
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,368
Or I want to have some kind of a saying that

906
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:54,208
That's a level of granularity that we don't necessarily have today

907
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,256
But it might be worth having a discussion around

908
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,864
M4 manufacturers to have a way to reassure consumer confidence

909
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,400
Not without

910
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,960
Especially imposing a one-size-fits-all

911
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
Our judgments

912
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,776
Must suffice for everyone

913
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
Tesla Model

914
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:13,920
How scalable is something like that for me implementation standpoint

915
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:19,296
And most manufacturers feel like if they do an opt-in kind of model the lose

916
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:24,160
Like 80 to 90% of people who would otherwise be part of their kind of

917
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
Data samples

918
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,000
Is that in your experience

919
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:33,120
True and is it possible to actually implement this without destroying kind of some of the business models

920
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,424
You know I have a feeling

921
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
Until we try it

922
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,240
We won't really have great data

923
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,872
Until we have some this granularity and transparency we won't be able to figure out whether at the mall with it works well

924
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
Scalefast

925
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,968
I think that it's a design choice

926
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,784
That kind of gets built into your business model

927
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,320
In some ways

928
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,600
Hyannis

929
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
It's one that might be

930
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,464
Stereo risky to summon facturas but

931
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
You can look at it

932
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
Delaware

933
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,864
You are the only one in the marketplace offering

934
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,400
That type of granularity

935
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,448
You might draw on a bigger group

936
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,496
Do I have the feeling this

937
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,312
Once one or two offer it several others

938
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,336
In the marketplace

939
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,128
Will start to come about an offer

940
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
And you can

941
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,736
These are the effects of those different files into different experimentation

942
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,552
Dozens and hundreds

943
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,320
Thousand

944
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:29,952
Maybe this can be a competitive differentiator for some of those devices and some of his companies

945
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:30,976
So that

946
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,280
Somebody by pick their device

947
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,864
I think that's like I said there's just not enough

948
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,888
Yet

949
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,448
About some of those choices that people would make

950
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,472
If they had them

951
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,264
Which I don't think there are any device

952
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,664
There are a couple devices that allow you not to put your information on the cloud

953
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,968
But you're right there very few

954
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,296
I think I've mentioned them I know I've mentioned them before but

955
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,112
The welcome cam 400 is a

956
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,904
Video camera that allows you to

957
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,184
To keep all of your data

958
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,768
Inside an SD card in the device or

959
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,304
On your own server at home

960
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,608
Then there's also an up-and-coming project

961
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,424
From silk Labs called the sense

962
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,704
Video camera that does this

963
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
Same thing

964
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
So what we'll see

965
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,288
What about this

966
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,312
Because you got

967
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,360
A couple recommendations about

968
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,176
We'll call it what happens when the device isn't connected

969
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:29,600
Maybe you go out of business which I think is a really good one to talk about especially because in the beginning of the

970
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,648
What you bring up the fact that consumers

971
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,928
Aren't exactly

972
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,488
Adopting the stuff in droves like

973
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
We thought

974
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:41,376
Right yeah that's a great question one of the things that we that we found, really on our research shows that

975
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,680
Is there another thing sucks company they go

976
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,960
Bankrupt all the time

977
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,264
Alarm or just stop making the device

978
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
Or

979
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,336
Maybe they forget to renew the domain name

980
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:55,199
And you can have all these instances where those loss of digital assets

981
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,271
Really make the device on functional or

982
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,063
If I'm thinking like a criminal

983
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
I noticed that

984
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,671
Possibly forget to renew their domain name or they go out of business

985
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,719
Michael and snatch that domain name

986
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,535
And then just push out an update that will do something

987
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,583
The customer has not agreed

988
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,375
So

989
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,447
Having some kind of a capability to operate

990
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,727
When the company is

991
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
Got underland

992
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,543
Domain is not reachable

993
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,615
When you send out an update that

994
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
Somebody might die

995
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,943
Necessarily want to apply

996
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,735
Thinking about those types of things

997
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,575
It's really important and it's an important again at commitment to your customer

998
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,623
On how you will treat them

999
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
I think one of those

1000
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,695
Interesting Dimensions that use

1001
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,231
Got at the Forum past shows

1002
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
Is

1003
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,279
Changing

1004
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,071
An arbitration clause

1005
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,143
And bundling that along with some type of an update

1006
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
System

1007
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,983
Especially the case when you have something like a

1008
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:53,055
A change in a binding arbitration clause or

1009
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,847
Functionality update

1010
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
That

1011
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:59,199
Might be bundled with something much more essential much more important

1012
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,015
Where you want a high degree of adoption update

1013
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,063
And you want to separate out those two

1014
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,367
Different pieces of the two different

1015
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,159
Goals are choices

1016
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
For the consumer

1017
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,511
If they don't agree to a new arbitration

1018
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Claws

1019
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,815
They can still agree to

1020
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:18,911
The change in terms of service for the future set that they updated

1021
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,495
Don't lie I totally agree and so

1022
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,543
I have a couple quick questions for you

1023
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,359
One being as someone who's got a deal with

1024
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
Updates

1025
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:31,967
I find it one of the most agonizing thing is firmware updates

1026
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,271
Like around the connected devices so like

1027
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,575
I go to like open the app

1028
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
Control my lights

1029
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,135
Cassette like dinner pretty lady

1030
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,671
Firmware update required

1031
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,327
Do you have any advice for people about when they should

1032
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,119
Try to update something that

1033
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:53,471
I don't say it's always on cuz it's not but it's not the sort of thing for your leg

1034
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,775
Oh I really want to do this right now

1035
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,591
In Isaac in a perfect world

1036
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,359
Updates

1037
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
ABCmouse

1038
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:05,247
Are there wouldn't have to be some decision-making process on the part of the the customer

1039
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,831
It would just happen and nothing would change except for beneficial

1040
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,879
You get extra features to play with with

1041
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,671
You could then read it out later

1042
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,999
Just right now they're enough

1043
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,279
Problems of Racine

1044
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
Some of these

1045
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
App updates

1046
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
Firmware updates

1047
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,911
That it really should be

1048
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
Something that

1049
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,519
The customer decides whether or not they want

1050
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,799
I think imagine

1051
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,847
Coming back from a long trip

1052
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,151
You come in and none of your lights work

1053
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,175
Because

1054
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,831
Okay and final question for you before I let you go

1055
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,159
Do you have connected devices in your house

1056
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,695
I do not

1057
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,231
I've spent the last

1058
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,535
4 years without a permanent home

1059
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,071
Moving about everyone

1060
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,375
Six months in different parts of the world sale

1061
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
I unfortunately

1062
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:57,215
Don't have much of a home to connect

1063
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,519
Okay that was the saddest answer ever

1064
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,127
Have any connected devices

1065
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
Absolutely

1066
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:12,063
I'm not sure what they would because I haven't been shopping for them but I would absolutely take out the sometimes of the connected device if I saw

1067
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,111
A really good reason to really get benefits

1068
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:17,951
Do it I don't know what's out there today that would

1069
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,487
Substantially add value

1070
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
To my wife

1071
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:24,351
I think some of the value that's going to come from these things is integrating

1072
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,375
6 a.m.

1073
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,167
Different things

1074
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,983
With some Pelican online profile with

1075
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,519
Daily calendar

1076
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,799
And then

1077
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,615
Getting some of the benefits in that way so the Sun

1078
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,895
Degree

1079
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,711
What are you thinking just have one it's like the old lady

1080
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,503
Are you can't eat just one

1081
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,807
You can't have just one smart home device

1082
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,343
I realize a lot of benefits.

1083
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,879
But you have to get multiple

1084
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,951
I bring them together for the the network effect

1085
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:55,071
Which brings us back to one of the original problems that we talked about so we'll have to

1086
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,143
Hope that people read this document and change their ways

1087
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,703
Thank you so much for coming on the show today

1088
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,983
Thank you Stacey

1089
