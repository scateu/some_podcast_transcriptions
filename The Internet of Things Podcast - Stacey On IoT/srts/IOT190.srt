Tea

83
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,520
Awesome you guys

84
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:56,384
Man I feel like the last couple episodes we spent a lot of time talking about privacy

85
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
And

86
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
It looks like

87
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
Now we're actually getting

88
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,248
Somewhere in the legislative

89
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
World

90
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
Yay

91
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
Yay

92
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,440
So the ntia which is the national telecommunications infrastructure Asia

93
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
See it's part of the department

94
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,048
They also handle like rural Broadband in

95
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
Stuff that you like what

96
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
I don't know about the NCAA

97
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
You may have to

98
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
Because

99
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,936
They have been responsible for

100
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Are coming up with some

101
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
Updated privacy

102
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
They were published

103
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
Actually in

104
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
September

105
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
In the Federal Register

106
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
Which is very good reading

107
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,688
Curl up with that every night

108
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
I'm glad we have lawyers

109
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,760
What is a journalist

110
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,880
Come over this stuff but recently what happened as everybody had to submit comment

111
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:43,488
And so we're seeing a lot of comments now for various agencies and organizations talking about

112
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
So it's time to dig

113
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,888
Basically the ntia is trying to figure out the

114
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,936
The administration's approach to Consumer privacy

115
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,776
They settled on the FTC the Federal Trade Commission

116
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,592
For taking care of enforcement

117
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:04,736
For this so it's not going to be an auntie a thing cuz they're already handles things like deceptive advertising

118
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
Consumer privacy and other areas

119
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
To the FTC

120
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
Bfcc by the way

121
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
Is it a common saying

122
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
Let's dig into what

123
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
Ntia thinks we should be

124
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
First step

125
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,727
So I like the approach that they've taken here because they got two sections where they

126
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,847
Highlighted about 7 privacy outcome so we know what to expect or what these

127
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
Ideas wealth APUSH

128
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:38,783
For Consumer privacy and then 8 high-level goals for federal action so we've got the outcome based

129
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,391
Situation here that they're outlining so what do you want to go through the Privacy outcomes first

130
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
Sure but first I want to say

131
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
Outcome-based

132
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Best approach is really important

133
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
Because

134
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,095
We're dealing with an area that is so cool

135
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Quickly changing

136
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,703
But we can't have something to prescriptive because it's going to become outdated weight

137
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
So I think that's a really important

138
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,615
Starting now to the why these will be very off a high-level generic

139
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
So they can be modified

140
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,735
Under certain sections in the future if things change I would think

141
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
Yeah and that you have discretion

142
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,415
So the agency responsible for enforcement and this is both a good thing and a bad thing it depends on who's in charge of

143
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,207
Discretion does

144
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Ideally

145
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
It will

146
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
B2

147
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Better

148
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,839
Boss basically that are little bit more Flex

149
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Example of something that

150
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
Ongoing anime

151
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
So how come

152
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
Let's talk about him first step

153
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
Transparency

154
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,567
You should be able to understand how people collect and share your

155
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,895
Your data what's really noteworthy here is baseball

156
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
Specifically call out

157
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,991
The idea of Leslie notices

158
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,295
Describing a company's privacy program

159
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,599
Consumers initial point of interaction

160
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
The product does not lead

161
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Adequate

162
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
That is basically a

163
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Stabbot

164
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
Euless it is it is an we talked about this before I would like to know that before I even buy the product now.

165
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
Get into how track sleep

166
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
Make it happen

167
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
Weather going

168
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
And last week when we were taught.

169
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
I think it was last

170
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,943
When we had the person talk about the digital standard on the show she actually suggested that when you put something in your

171
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
Your Amazon

172
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,247
UC

173
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
Basic

174
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
Privacy

175
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
And kind of data sharing

176
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
Framework

177
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
Notice which I actually thought was

178
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
I like that I like that

179
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,487
So hey Amazon if you're listening

180
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
About that

181
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Okay

182
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
Next up

183
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
Control

184
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:27,839
You should be able to

185
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,167
Exercise reasonable control over the collection use storage and desk

186
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
Disclosure of your personal info

187
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
Information that you

188
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Provide

189
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
This is

190
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:40,383
Interesting it reminds me of when you install an app on your phone where permissions are asked

191
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,479
You know what you want to Grant this app permission to see your contacts

192
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,295
I like this type of data use your GPS Etc

193
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
I don't think

194
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,159
Sometimes we just say yes blindly to all those permission requests

195
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:57,023
If you're not going to use a particular function if you're not going to use location-based functions of a device

196
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,423
The whole device should still work except for that function that a lot of times you can't even use a device or nap unless you agree to all of them

197
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,823
What's up when they say control I kind of read into it that way and maybe I'm reading into it too much but that's what I like to see

198
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
Will have talked about it doesn't really get

199
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
Into

200
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:19,039
Now it does say that you should be able to rescind your permissions as well

201
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Which is nice

202
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,879
So moving on a reasonable minimization

203
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
Data collection should

204
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
Deminimize

205
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
It needs to be

206
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
Weighed against the risk of privacy

207
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
Harp

208
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
So it also talks in this is tied into the next

209
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Security

210
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,959
The company collecting this data needs to have

211
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Security

212
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
In place

213
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:44,127
So if you're going to collect the state of you as a user should expect that the company is keeping it

214
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Secure

215
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
And that the companies Gathering it should

216
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,783
To take measures appropriate to the level of risk associated if you lose it

217
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
Which means if you're like an experience

218
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
Saying that

219
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
Oh well

220
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
We had a password

221
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
Are servers that has

222
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,279
All of your sensitive credit card Medical

223
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
Financial info

224
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
That's not good enough

225
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
Especially the password

226
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,887
Password

227
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
They want to see a lot more

228
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:12,799
Also in the security section may discuss securing personal data at all stages

229
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:18,431
It's not just that collection computation storage but even the transfer of raw and processed data which

230
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
Is a must in my opinion

231
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,343
Cuz that actually makes it a bear

232
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
Access

233
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Correction

234
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:32,255
Is user should have access to the data that you collected on them and

235
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,815
They should be able to have a process to change it

236
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,911
Which is really important as we start talking about things like oh I don't know

237
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,983
Your health insurance information being collected from your Fitbit

238
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
Maybe you lost it for a day

239
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
And it's not accurate

240
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,615
You should be able to have a process by which

241
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
To say that

242
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,527
I agree I just end this is an edge case I worry about

243
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
People who made

244
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,623
Do nefarious things and then go back in

245
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
Scrub

246
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:03,999
Make the sound captured by a smart device when they take that nefarious thing later you know

247
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
I'm okay with

248
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,143
Cuz even scrubbing the data

249
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,959
So in the Kate like if I murdered someone and then went back in

250
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Erase those

251
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
Sound files from my echo

252
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,311
They're still circumstantial evidence

253
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
Oh hey what were they doing

254
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,063
Yeah I wasn't going there

255
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Management

256
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
This is

257
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,695
Kind of Tide with the security stuff but basically

258
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Hey

259
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
Try not to expose people's personal data

260
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
And

261
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,607
Basically I don't say this because this is how they're

262
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
Pitching this

263
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,703
Risk management is the core of this Administration

264
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,799
Approach as it provides the flexibility to encourage innovation in business models and

265
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,407
Privacy tools while focusing on potential consumer harm and maximizing private

266
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,479
It's also a really hard thing to legislate

267
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Yeah

268
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,831
Accountability

269
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,415
Organization should be accountable both internally and externally

270
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,975
For collecting and using personal information

271
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
A-Team

272
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
Also if you

273
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,607
Collect data you need to make sure that your third party

274
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Companies that have access

275
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
Better service provider

276
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
They are also accountable for the use

277
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:25,151
That one's yeah because then we just had this many times in the show Once the data is

278
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,503
Casino

279
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,111
Original company doesn't really have any control until after the fact

280
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,439
Third party company uses that private data

281
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
Wrongly

282
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,863
Sure you can shut them down and shut down access but they still have all that old data at this is a really tricky situation

283
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:51,263
It is although I think it does encourage people to be a little bit more circumspect about who their share data with in the first place

284
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
It's right Yep this is basically a scribe

285
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,383
Hopefully penalties to the improper use of

286
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
Which right now there aren't really

287
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
It's unclear exactly what these penalties would be the F2

288
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,111
DC that's the power to fine people that has the power to censure them doesn't

289
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Have

290
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Lck

291
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,999
Those were the Privacy outcomes

292
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
Let's talk about

293
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
High-level goals

294
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
So these are again

295
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
Big picture they want

296
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
They want to harmonize the regulatory lives

297
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Skip that makes sense

298
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311
Not a lot of lies they want legal Clarity while maintaining the

299
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Flexibility

300
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
What about that

301
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,895
Comprehensive application

302
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Eniac

303
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Addressing

304
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
Super privacy should apply to

305
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
Do all private

306
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
That is nice

307
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
Because right now the only legislation that

308
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,903
We have it a federal level it was an attempt is legislation that

309
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
Applied only to government contractors

310
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
It was more about

311
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
And that was kind of like

312
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Everyone must play

313
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,351
Play Risk and outcome based approach

314
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,935
That could come back and bite us olbia

315
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,751
As consumers it may not be the most consumer-friendly

316
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
That'll be an Aries

317
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
I don't want to watch

318
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
Interoperability

319
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
Time is very excited about it

320
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,735
So when I first read this I kind of thought interoperability in terms of like

321
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:10,367
Platform is talking to each other and so on but it's not so much that it's just a step back saying we realize that

322
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Two events

323
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,439
No smart devices and all these new

324
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,839
Services are coming out based on personal data you know they are based on personal data so we don't want to cut down and make it difficult for

325
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Play services

326
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,703
We still have to make sure the personal data is

327
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
Protected so it's

328
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
And they're saying we should

329
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,919
Sika reduce friction placed on data flows better developing a landscape landscape

330
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Trademarks

331
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:40,063
Around the world that the United States participates in and so on so I think this is kind of like just a high-level thing saying no

332
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
We got to be carefully balanced

333
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
Privacy risks

334
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,183
It's versus stifling Innovation we don't want to do that

335
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
And

336
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
It would stifle innovation

337
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
If there was like

338
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
Our rules were really different from like

339
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,351
Gdpr

340
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Yes

341
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,959
They also call for incentivizing privacy research

342
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
Yay money

343
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
For privacy reason

344
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,055
FTC enforcement we talked about that

345
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
And scalability

346
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,407
Administration should ensure that the proverbial

347
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,199
Sticks used to incentivize drunk

348
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,247
Consumer privacy outcomes are deployed in

349
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,831
Portion to the scale and scope of the information an organization is

350
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Mishandling

351
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,415
So small businesses that don't have a lot of information

352
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
They probably shouldn't be the big targets

353
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
So basically

354
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Facebook Google

355
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Experian

356
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
OU big toes

357
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
Target on your back

358
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
If you don't behave

359
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
So

360
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,727
So far feedback has been

361
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,031
Mostly like hey the ftc's good for this

362
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,823
Privacy watchdog

363
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
Good with a lot of things

364
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
In aggregate

365
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
Question the small print

366
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:44,063
Flexibility so those are where you're going to see the vice and then the

367
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
Yunnan libertarian

368
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
Anti-privacy people are like

369
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
This goes too far

370
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,487
So we'll keep an eye on that

371
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,839
She is in December and February holding their own hearings on privacy

372
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
So we're going to be hearing a lot more

373
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
It was a lot about private

374
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
At least you guys didn't have to read through it

375
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
Yeah they should

376
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Federal Register

377
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
Oh yeah

378
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
All right that's why we are

379
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
Okay

380
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
Let's talk about body

381
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
That's because this is why

382
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,599
Cheapest kind of popped up out of nowhere but it's

383
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,903
I don't say it's an old story but it's an old

384
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
Yeah I don't know

385
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:28,607
So back in January 2013 there was an advisory so back in 2013 it was an advisory released

386
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:35,007
Explaining a critical flaw in affected routers from Big names fraud, Sue Cisco tp-link

387
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,335
D-Link Netcare u.s. robotics or there's an opening for you

388
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,663
And it turns out that last week

389
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
That

390
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:48,575
Issue was looked into again at netlab 360 that researchers that look into these exploits and such

391
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
It's still around

392
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:56,767
And apparently is taking control of about 100000 different home and small office routers from that range of menu

393
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,839
Bashers I don't know why I was never fixed I guess

394
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
Didn't seem an issue at the time I don't know

395
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
It all

396
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,471
Revolves around universal plug and play

397
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
Here's the thing most people

398
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:15,199
In-the-know don't use UPnP or Universal plug-and-play they disable it whenever possible

399
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:20,831
Problem is there are still some Modern services and devices that require UPnP

400
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,671
I think I'm almost positive but the Chromecast still does

401
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
Chromecast

402
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Requires up

403
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:33,119
Exactly the problem is with UPnP you're pretty much opening up your network to always be scan

404
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,191
Scanning for other UPnP type devices so just

405
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,031
So we just work so that's great from a user experience standpoint but it's

406
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,335
Terrible from a security standpoint

407
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Yes

408
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
In fact

409
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,407
If you search for Chromecast and

410
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
UPnP you get all these things

411
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,991
Please help me use my Chromecast

412
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
UPnP

413
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,855
And fortunately Google says

414
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
Yeah I know

415
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:01,023
If you do have UPnP enabled and you have one of these Spartan 16 models of routers

416
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,423
Leaving Atlanta 360 has a list of them you should check to see if there's a router update or it

417
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Patch available

418
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:16,383
I would agree with you on that I know routers can get expensive and all that but yeah I would agree

419
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
All right

420
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,431
Those are big

421
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
Let's talk about neural networks

422
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,551
Intel has a new one it's based on the movie Diaz

423
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
Chip Caray

424
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
Several years ago now

425
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,975
They launched one of these a year ago and it was

426
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Huge

427
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,303
Hit people loved it it basically gives you

428
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
AI Computing capabilities

429
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
Edge device

430
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Some people

431
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,703
Optimind drones and other things just to start like

432
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
Creating these new models

433
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
This version is

434
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
A hundred bucks

435
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
It's a bit more powerful and

436
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
You know same functionality

437
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,943
I expect this to sell very well

438
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Community info

439
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
Developers who are trying

440
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,807
Figure out how to bring AI to the edge

441
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
So check that out

442
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,879
Yeah just a little USB stick

443
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,207
Plug into your computer

444
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
Apparently

445
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:09,631
Which that makes sense to me but I don't think you know everyday consumers going to rush out and say I want to make my drone smart let me go get this is going to be for

446
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,703
People who are kind of tinkering and making devices which many which

447
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,007
Are built on you know some piece of Linux

448
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
This is definitely

449
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
I would say

450
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,335
Professional Developers

451
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Paper streamers

452
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
Nerds of the world

453
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
All right

454
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Amazon

455
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
So much Amazon stock

456
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Basilisk

457
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,087
They have their voice controlled microwave now available 6

458
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Starbucks

459
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,207
Call Amazon's digital assistant

460
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
Cook baked potato in poof

461
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
It happens

462
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
This is not

463
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
To make your life easier

464
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
Because you think everyone talks about this microwave in there like

465
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
Okay I still have to get up

466
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
And put the thing in the microwave

467
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
And like that is not

468
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
Help that this is providing

469
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,615
Voice Control in this is providing all the thinking behind the scenes

470
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,639
Thanks for setting the time

471
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,919
Time to roast a baked potato

472
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
In the microwave

473
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,711
Or to make pop

474
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,527
It's almost late and I know we talked about this

475
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,111
Prayer because we both have one it's almost like the smarts of a June oven

476
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,671
Shrunken down into a microwave and with a voice

477
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:11,071
Control to access those smart as opposed to with the June we have a keypad in some other weekend use matinee to preheat

478
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,399
And also available as the Fire TV recast

479
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Which is the

480
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,495
Antenna it's kind of like a personal Arrow

481
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
Remember that

482
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,871
It allows you to get digital TV signals and record it

483
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
Which over-the-air

484
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,223
DTV over-the-air over-the-air

485
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,807
I'm excited about that actually because I can't get over there television on

486
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,599
So I have to either buy it from

487
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,903
Play Swerve maybe this device will finally work

488
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,695
Who knows finally help me

489
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
I've had so many antennas

490
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
Just nothing

491
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
And also

492
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,583
You can add devices to

493
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
A room

494
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
Using your voice and

495
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,215
Microwave the recast in this voice

496
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:53,567
Adding devices via voice capability all of this was announced in September

497
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
With the Amazons gigantic

498
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
Very difficult cover

499
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
Very cool

500
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
So

501
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
Devices which

502
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
Use

503
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
React

504
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
Madame a Connect

505
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Kit

506
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
They will

507
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Actually

508
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
You can

509
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,975
Plug those devices in or

510
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,767
Just basically give those devices

511
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
The power they're going to

512
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Fire up

513
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,351
And they're going to be able to

514
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,399
Locate themselves on your Wi-Fi

515
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,703
Work if Amazon has your Wi-Fi credentials

516
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,775
They will connect and then your Madame a device

517
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
She's going to say

518
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
Hey I see a smart plug

519
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
What would you like to call it

520
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,919
To be like I'd like to call the kitchen

521
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
And it'll be like

522
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,479
Would you like to put it in a room

523
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
How do you say yes please put in the kitchen

524
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
And all of that is done via

525
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Awesome

526
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:43,231
That's all I'm making a setup experience easier the plug-and-play in a sense having itself discover

527
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,839
And then adding the room by voice and it does not get any easier than that no app needed

528
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
And that's why

529
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
When all this

530
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
Just came out in September and I

531
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,799
Talked about this being like apple like in its Simplicity and I think this is a big

532
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
Huge

533
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Step four

534
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Amazon

535
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
In

536
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,663
Identifying the problems with a smart home

537
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Solving it

538
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,783
And I can't describe the big trend for next year which is the normalization in mainstream

539
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Smart Home

540
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
So

541
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
Moving on

542
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,927
Amazon also announced

543
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,719
This is actually a new announcement

544
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,767
An actual happening

545
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,839
Routines will not work with the echo buttons

546
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,399
So if you have one of those Echo buttons that

547
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,703
Timeout I think last year in basically

548
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
Sounds like you could use some to play games and

549
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
Nobody

550
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,079
But now you basically have a button

551
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,175
And you can actually do this using after other things

552
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,247
Now you can have it a little bit part usually with Amazon

553
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
And you

554
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,295
Take one of these buttons

555
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
When you press it it

556
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Movie time

557
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,879
Or whatever

558
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:49,279
I did not buy one of the buttons but now I swear to wish I did because there are times when I want to fire up a routine and don't want to go into an

559
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:55,167
And or don't want to speak aloud because maybe every sleeping or something so just having fun

560
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,727
My next to me

561
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,031
How awesome would it be to have a party time button

562
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,591
That you just have in your house and you're just like

563
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Guys

564
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
I just got a promotion

565
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,711
What what

566
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,247
I think that would be like

567
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,575
Awesome if you have small kids and they come home with a Great Raid on their paper

568
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
I mean

569
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
Play seriously mention

570
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
And that this would be

571
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,952
Kind of meat for the disabled

572
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
Or people who have

573
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Service dogs

574
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
Because dogs

575
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
Press the button

576
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
Which I was like

577
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
Wow

578
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,912
Okay but now we have to have a little bit of real talk about Amazon routine

579
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
Here Comes

580
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
It is not good

581
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,032
I can't control anything with Amazon return

582
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
There are no devices

583
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,920
Right just before the show

584
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,224
Stacy had me double check

585
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,248
Alipay app

586
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
And going to routines

587
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
And there's not a band there for devices

588
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:49,952
My couldn't find any devices that would work with a routine and then you only found one

589
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
So

590
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,840
This aspect would be semi automation but

591
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:00,192
There's nothing there and I have a lot like I wanted to cuz we had had it

592
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,728
Question last week about

593
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
Cameras

594
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
And

595
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
Bringing in

596
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
Emotion detection

597
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,640
Or something like that

598
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,944
Right

599
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
So I did

600
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
And I

601
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,040
It feels like I have

602
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:20,672
3 different cameras on there I have the wise cam I have the August doorbell Cam and I have

603
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
Oh gosh Arlo's

604
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,000
All tied in there and none of them

605
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Internet scams won't be

606
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,120
Nest camera API so I'm like

607
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:33,472
I guess ring maybe is supportive and I just don't happen to have a ring cam right now so

608
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,288
Yeah I'm not understanding it either

609
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
Dispensary

610
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:42,688
Very odd to have that devices tab under routines and then nothing showing up when things that you work with

611
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
Padme

612
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,272
Just keeping that up there

613
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
You know we'll keep back on

614
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
What's on my Google

615
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
Google Glass

616
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
Enterprise Beach

617
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,440
Me to Kevin what has happened there

618
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,512
Will last year there were some

619
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,328
Lakes rivers Etc of Google

620
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,144
Creating a new Google Glass for the Enterprise

621
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,192
We never really heard much of anything since

622
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
However this week

623
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
The

624
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,800
Second gen Google Glass Enterprise Edition

625
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,104
Got through the FCC certifications

626
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,664
So it's a real product cuz they tested it

627
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
And

628
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:19,808
Can't really say what the specs are I mean we have some leak specs from last year that still include a camera

629
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,880
Intel atom chip and apparently 32

630
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,160
K-Cup storage wood

631
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,744
I'm not sure why you would want that so but specs aside

632
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,328
There is I think I market for Google Glass in the answer

633
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
Surprise

634
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,424
Target I see it all the time heads-up displays are

635
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,472
Huge when I go to these Industrial

636
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
So yes

637
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:45,152
Yeah I mean I wonder if you could kind of do some of the same things from a contextual notification standpoint like maybe

638
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
You need to get an alert that

639
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,480
Production line for is down or there is

640
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,808
An issue something is heating up maybe a smartwatch would do it but

641
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
I kind of like

642
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
The fact that you could just

643
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,160
Panda Pop up in front of your eye

644
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
Left about

645
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,488
That and it's more about fixing or repairing

646
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
Pairing

647
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,816
So these people aren't wearing them all the time

648
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:07,936
On the factory line it's more like you put them on or an engineer puts them on to go diagnose

649
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,472
Deal with a piece of equipment

650
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
So

651
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,312
That and that makes sense

652
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,872
Sure sure I suspect that

653
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,688
AR goggles and glasses will take the place of that beat

654
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,480
Pause the Google Glass

655
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
Screen

656
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
Low-res and small

657
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,600
Looking up product information and

658
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
Justin

659
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
Justin okay alright

660
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,256
Google Glass heads up to

661
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
Sure

662
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,888
Yes alright let's move on to the Google home

663
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
2.7

664
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:44,544
No I have not received the version of Google home to 7 on my

665
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:51,200
But the folks at 9 to 5 Google took the Android version and kind of pecans I do this often

666
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,784
And they say among all the different improvements are coming

667
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,368
They see a lot of Google Wi-Fi settings

668
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,672
Being listed in your not used yet

669
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
But basically a bunch of

670
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,256
Strings that are suggesting that you'll be

671
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,816
Configuring your changing your Google Wi-Fi stop

672
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
In the Google home app

673
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,680
And I have mixed emotions about that I wrote a post

674
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:15,776
The earlier this week about it saying is it time for a Google home and Google Wi-Fi to merge

675
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,104
Super Muscle perspective it almost sounds like that's happening

676
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,152
I'm not a fan of it because

677
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:25,504
Google just make the Google home at much more simple with the last release

678
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,040
Yes

679
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
And it was so white

680
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:33,184
It is nice and fat guy finally after 2 weeks 2 weeks after you I got it on my Lenovo smart

681
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,024
You can see all of your Google home devices and all its wonderful

682
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,816
But I don't want my Wi-Fi

683
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,608
Crap cluttering up all the hats

684
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,168
The flipside is from a hardware perspective

685
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
I think it makes a lot of sense

686
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
And I'm not saying

687
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,776
But that's what Google is doing

688
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:52,384
I'm thinking about it I'd like to see a color higher-end Google home

689
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
Product that includes

690
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
MiFi

691
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,968
Mesh capabilities

692
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:02,368
I want less boxes and things in my house always have been already there but it just makes sense to

693
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,160
Combine the two in my opinion

694
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:09,024
I would like to see Google simplify I would have liked

695
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,328
To see Wi-Fi and home all be one

696
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,120
One place but you know that may never happen

697
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,144
But

698
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
Let's move on to

699
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
Quick

700
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
Ready here we go

701
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
If

702
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
New service

703
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,544
SpongeBob

704
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
One of them I care deeply about

705
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
Salty

706
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
The rest

707
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
I'm kind of like a lot of them are actually International

708
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
So we got

709
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,528
Link smart home we've got Mitsubishi electric remote cloud

710
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
But you do

711
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
Home environment

712
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
Airtouch

713
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
Other thermostat stuff

714
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,952
There's the roost leak detector

715
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,768
Which I don't know if you guys remember Roost they do

716
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,328
Smart smoke detector batteries they all have to leave

717
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,656
Are the Logitech Circle cam is now in there

718
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,936
We have a dutch

719
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,240
Grocer that I'm not even a try

720
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,800
Jews and we also have a German grocer

721
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,128
In South Asia Asia and Oceania

722
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152
They have

723
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,944
Japan's number-one business chat

724
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
That work

725
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
And

726
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,272
There's the Sun

727
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Take control

728
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
Connect to

729
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
So I don't

730
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
Summer and then

731
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,208
In India they've added base with

732
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
Which is a

733
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
Fun way to manage your money

734
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,560
I don't know if it's like a venmo for India but

735
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
By the way

736
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,400
So all of these Services now on if

737
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,192
Looking good for them

738
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,520
Also in the exciting bits

739
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
Call them that helped

740
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Fitness

741
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,664
Wellness Health and Wellness smart devices

742
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,736
They have a new

743
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,784
Tracker the pulse HR which

744
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,832
Looks remarkably a lot like a Fitbit

745
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,880
This $130

746
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:43,232
I actually I'm kind of a little tempted by it I'll be honest I had to pull sway back in

747
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
20

748
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,304
14 or something and

749
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,632
I thought I did a really good job at track heart rate steps

750
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
Other stuff

751
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,984
It integrates with a Majors like apples Health you can

752
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,544
Pull it into MyFitnessPal and some other

753
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
Services out there

754
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,896
I kind of hate to get up all my Fitbit data but I might

755
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:07,296
Sleep monitoring and up to 20 days on a single charge which is amazing

756
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,368
Thank you Kevin for pointing that out

757
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
All right

758
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:16,512
Last week we talked about view which was a smart Windows company that raised 1.1 billion dollars

759
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,072
Now this week we know why they raised so much

760
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
I talked to them

761
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
And they are

762
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
Basically going to

763
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,168
To try to

764
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,984
Because all of their Windows have a microcontroller

765
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,008
And a network

766
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,312
They decided that they will be the

767
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
Platform

768
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,640
From which to smartify your office

769
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,712
You may recall that they're letting companies out there that way

770
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,760
Parking sensor company

771
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
Deplatformed

772
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
Your office building

773
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
So it's

774
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
Sure

775
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
Go4it

776
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
Smart windows

777
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,208
Sure

778
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:49,536
Their argument is they come in very early in the bill process

779
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
So you can

780
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
Can tie into their system

781
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,120
Very quickly and easily

782
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,680
During the design phase before all these other

783
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
Chanced

784
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:57,984
The bid for the biz

785
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,800
So the first product is part of this

786
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,080
This is going to be a

787
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
Security thing that detects

788
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
Window breaks

789
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,432
So instead of using glass break detection

790
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,968
Which is an auditory sensor

791
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
Kind of thing

792
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,832
They're actually if you break one of their Windows it interrupts their electric current

793
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,648
Changes the ions in the glass to make it darker or lighter

794
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,928
And they know automatically

795
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,696
Because

796
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:18,976
EBay slippers

797
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
So that's the first service

798
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,072
Hopefully I heard flying into the window does not

799
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
Yeah

800
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
Although I feel bad for the birds

801
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Okay

802
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,776
That's got a grim note there

803
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
Let's talk about Enterprise

804
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Coyotes

805
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
Security

806
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:38,432
There's data out there from a company called digicert that hired a

807
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,712
Group out of Dallas

808
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
S2

809
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,784
Survey 700 organizations

810
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,624
Five countries those companies had to have done some iot

811
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,952
Option one of the big challenges in any idea.

812
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,976
Is people are worried about

813
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Security

814
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
And

815
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,048
The survey found

816
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,352
That there's definitely an upper tier

817
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,424
They are focused on

818
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,752
Iot security and making sure devices they bring in R6

819
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,800
Secure that they follow best practice

820
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,152
In those companies only a third of them had any sort of

821
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:09,920
Security breach

822
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,480
During the time frame of the survey

823
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,760
In the bottom half

824
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,064
The companies that aren't doing anything

825
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
They

826
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,160
Some sort of security data breach

827
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
So you know

828
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,232
That makes sense

829
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,024
They also said that

830
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
Those in the bottom

831
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
They all had an incident

832
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:33,472
They were more than six times as likely to experience 10 iot based denial-of-service attack

833
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,776
More than six times as likely to experience

834
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,336
Unauthorized access to iot devices

835
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:43,456
And 4.5 times as likely to experience iot based malware or ransomware

836
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
Those

837
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
That had those

838
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Issues

839
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,344
They found those issues

840
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,672
Cost at least 34 million in the last

841
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
S2

842
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
Years

843
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,512
And that's just of the surveyed companies

844
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,072
That is ridiculous

845
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
Don't be a bottom to your

846
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,656
Company B a top-tier company

847
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:07,776
And most of that is in monetary damages but some of that is like reputational.

848
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
And stock price

849
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,336
So some of that is

850
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Tangible

851
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
I can I just say I was

852
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,992
Extremely scared when I read the very first line of this survey

853
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,016
It's four words

854
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,808
Machines are taking over

855
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
Start out very

856
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
Yeah

857
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
Just a bit

858
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,696
And they're going to cost you money and be insecure

859
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,768
So we'll link to that survey so you can Panic on your

860
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
And now

861
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
We will move

862
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,352
2

863
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,168
What I'm going to say is like one of my favorite things so far

864
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:39,008
I've ever had in the iot podcast hotline which is somebody telling us

865
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
What we should do

866
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
Which

867
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,592
I'm sure all of you guys are now.

868
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,200
This is a good win from less

869
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
So

870
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,040
This is for everyone out there who is looking for

871
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,064
Outdoor

872
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,112
Camera and try to figure out how to turn

873
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,184
Actually if it has a USB cord

874
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,232
This might apply to a lot of people looking for out

875
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
Stuff so

876
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,280
Take it away less

877
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,352
Hi this is less I've got a reverse

878
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
Question you have

879
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,656
People calling app

880
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Kabob House

881
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,472
Security cameras outside

882
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
And the Dilemma is having

883
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
Power them

884
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,568
Some have built-in batteries

885
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
Some charge

886
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,360
USB device

887
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,896
I've actually put

888
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,688
A webcam outside

889
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,224
Used a

890
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
Battery pack that you use

891
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,528
Charge your phone

892
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,064
To be able to remotely

893
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
Charge my device

894
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,392
When the battery runs low

895
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
I just bring the

896
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,208
Battery pack in and recharge that

897
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,256
Save me having to take down

898
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Security camera

899
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
Just hope that it helps

900
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
Thanks so much

901
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
Spy

902
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
Okay

903
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,400
That was awesome

904
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,192
Les and you and

905
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
Kevin and I are looking at this

906
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,032
We went and looked for ruggedized battery packs

907
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:44,800
Kevin hasson

908
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:49,664
Look for an IP 66-65 rating on those and Kevin has some tips on

909
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
How big that battery should

910
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:57,600
Yeah I mean granted these are typically used for phones and they'll charge a phone you know $10,000 I have one my Charter phone

911
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
Six seven times

912
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,952
I think that's the minimum you want to go with for something like this

913
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
Granted

914
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,256
The most juice

915
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:08,096
From that battery pack is going to use when the wireless camera is streaming

916
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,144
So if you don't have continuous streaming

917
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,544
It will be using power much power all the time for Ruth's Chris motion detection such it won't be so bad but you probably are

918
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,824
I don't know

919
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,920
I'm thinking a couple days you might be stretched out to a week

920
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:26,272
With only battery packs if you go for something with maybe 20-25 thousand milliamps

921
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
That might be a stretch but

922
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,088
You'll have to swap them out pretty quick

923
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,672
But it's an option is and it's one I hadn't thought of so I was

924
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,232
Plated and when you get the bigger bricks

925
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,792
You're going to pay a much larger price so

926
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
10000 milliamps

927
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,864
Sprout highly ruggedized battery

928
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,144
Looks like you could get it for like

929
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
Below twenty bucks

930
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,960
If you move up to

931
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,032
Like 20,000 milliamps then you're looking at like 6.

932
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,824
So just keep that in mind

933
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,640

965
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,168
IMessage for this week sponsor

00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:52,032
Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for MS

967
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
Message from our sponsor

00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:57,408
This week sponsor is bitdefender and I have Alex Milan who is achieved

969
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,944
Security researcher at the

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
Defender here to talk to us

971
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
All right we talked about

972
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,576
Cyberbullying we talk about securing your router

973
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,600
And now

974
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,160
Let's talk about smart devices and security regulation

975
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
Smart devices are

976
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,488
Fun small new

977
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,048
And no one really wants to think about all the dangers associated

978
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,840
Manufacturers

979
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,120
Sapphires North

980
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,216
There a lot of third-party entities that have started to regulate the internet

981
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,008
Do we really need this

982
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
What year

983
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,360
Basic standards need to be imposed

984
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,640
To make sure that

985
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,016
Because

986
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,296
Device

987
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
Having very bad

988
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
In August

989
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
2016

990
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,512
450000

991
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,048
Devices were hot

992
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,328
Bicycle

993
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,376
Passwords

994
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,496
Are some basic

995
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,568
80 practices that can be applied

996
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,360
We strongly believe that

997
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,456
That's going to make

998
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
Manufacturers

999
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,016
Have some babies

1000
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
Mosto

1001
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,672
Are iot manufacturers doing enough

1002
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
How to make their products

1003
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
We

1004
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,432
Unfortunately

1005
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,736
Then five or 6%.

1006
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,784
What is synonyms of manufacturers

1007
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,832
Why do smart devices need secure

1008
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,624
Fall because they

1009
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,464
Most of them don't have any

1010
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,864
Indication

1011
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,544
I love this point in time

1012
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
Packers

1013
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
Will hack

1014
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,176
That's you

1015
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,016
Much more on a plane

1016
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,576
These undefended

1017
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,904
And can a security device or a service

1018
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,696
Protect all the smart devices in my

1019
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,488
If it's a good

1020
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,328
I hate to say that we launched

1021
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,984
Sometime ago

1022
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,032
What currently providing

1023
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,592
Fiction book

1024
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:42,016
So we have to get back to the station

1025
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:42,784
Nanjing

1026
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,088
That doesn't have many many many

1027
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,904
And where can I buy listeners go to find out more

1028
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
About bitdefender

This is your host

And today's guest

1034
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
What is Emily Silverman

1035
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,664
Who is the Denver Smart City

1036
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
Program

1037
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
Manager

1038
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,248
Hello Emily how are you doing today

1039
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
I'm great how are you

1040
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
I am

1041
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
Super

1042
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
Excited to talk to you

1043
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,648
Let's just get started with

1044
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Talk to us

1045
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,208
About what you're doing

1046
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,488
Related to making Denver

1047
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,512
Into a smarter City

1048
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
To be like

1049
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,072
Think that

1050
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
In order for Denver to be a smart

1051
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,888
City we have

1052
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,192
To empower not only city workers

1053
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
But residents

1054
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,032
Businesses and even those who come to Denver

1055
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,824
To get the best information

1056
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,360
To make this a safe

1057
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
Healthy place

1058
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
For all

1059
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:44,480
How do you define I mean that sounded almost like a definition of the

1060
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,296
But how do you know when a city is released

1061
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
What is second

1062
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Take me through it

1063
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,416
So what we're doing is we are really

1064
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,952
Progressively embracing

1065
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,000
But I'm going to emphasize that aggressively because of

1066
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,304
We see this as a real paradigm shift

1067
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,120
And we want to do it in a thoughtful manner so we're testing

1068
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,656
New and better ways

1069
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,936
To deploy technology

1070
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:09,312
This idea of creating two way communication between smart devices and using data to improve services

1071
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
Search for residence

1072
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,616
Businesses in Austin visitors

1073
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,664
When I think of what it really boils down to

1074
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,504
It's the idea of using data to make our city better and what does that mean

1075
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,856
Cities already have really intelligent people who are doing great

1076
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,392
Things on a daily basis

1077
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,184
How do we add value

1078
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,464
To those efforts

1079
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,512
Such a specific surround air quality

1080
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,280
Congestion

1081
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,816
And then ask people are driving

1082
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
Extrude

1083
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,120
And what does that do

1084
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,912
That helps us get people to

1085
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:38,752
To where they need to be faster it helps us really understand the house

1086
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,776
Love our kids

1087
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,568
I'm making sure that we get them

1088
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
School and where they need to be

1089
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,152
To be on those ladders of opportunity

1090
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,456
Thrift they can really achieve everything that they want

1091
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,272
Those are big and

1092
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,296
Pretty awesome goals

1093
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
So

1094
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,880
It's very easy to say hey this is what we're after

1095
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,440
It's a lot harder to actually Implement something that

1096
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,232
Make even some of those things

1097
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,792
Breakdown how Denver is due

1098
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,072
You and your team

1099
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
How are you at

1100
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
This problem

1101
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,424
Yeah so we were really galvanized by

1102
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,472
Three main things and then I really wanted to

1103
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,032
Talk with you about what our strategy is

1104
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,568
From a higher level in that week

1105
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
Dive into details to

1106
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,640
The three items that

1107
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:21,248
Really got us energized around smart cities and the value that it

1108
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,016
Bring

1109
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:25,344
The people that we serve more among mayor Hancock

1110
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,368
Efforts around p

1111
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
Peak Academy

1112
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,440
Which is this really Innovative program

1113
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,744
Using lean Six Sigma process

1114
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,512
Improvement

1115
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
But saying

1116
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,584
Every person who worked at the city

1117
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
Is an expert in

1118
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,376
Something

1119
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,680
How did they get empowered

1120
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,752
To make the best decisions improve prophecies

1121
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,080
To deliver the services in a manner that really helps

1122
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
The resident

1123
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
Who need it most

1124
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:52,736
An example that mayor Hancock uses is really looking at efficiency for examples with

1125
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,320
Food stamps are the Department of Motor Vehicle to reduce wait time

1126
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:00,928
Any chance between when somebody comes in and needs a 30 service and that service

1127
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,976
Delivered the second catalyst

1128
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,512
Is that we were a finalist

1129
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,328
The US Department of Transportation smart cities

1130
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:11,936
Challenge only one of seven finalists we saw the value of working

1131
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,216
Together because it was

1132
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:17,056
Cross-functional teams among departments that really put together that apple

1133
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,384
Haitian anniversary thing we're great strategic partnership

1134
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
That we have

1135
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,712
Not only with our existing partners with an attack

1136
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,736
Technology space

1137
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,272
But also with Partners such a

1138
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
Panasonic

1139
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,368
Amazon North American headquarters to a transit-oriented

1140
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,416
Development within the City and County of Denver

1141
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,952
We also took a look

1142
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,232
At what smart city did

1143
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,768
Cuz as you mentioned it means

1144
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
So many things

1145
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,704
Some people for us we really wanted to understand that this is an emerging industry one thing I think about is it

1146
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,520
We want to work with people who know how to work on complex

1147
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,288
Projects

1148
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,080
I don't necessarily call themselves

1149
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,872
Experts in a smart City space

1150
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,151
Because we're all learning it

1151
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,455
Together and she will eat it if we did a very

1152
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
Tactical strategy

1153
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,551
Existing funding that worked on from Africa

1154
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,343
Three major departments

1155
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,671
Including the mayor's office and then technology services

1156
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,975
Does the Department of Public Health and environment

1157
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,999
And Public Works

1158
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,535
And then we try to work

1159
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,815
Together to develop

1160
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:14,655
Some additional funding mechanisms and we wanted to really test

1161
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
Some of the

1162
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
Technology

1163
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,727
And look at what it was

1164
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,007
Shazam be able to think so

1165
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,847
So how do we do this what we started looking at a living life

1166
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,919
Contact so what we did is we wanted to focus in on

1167
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,455
Specific Geographic areas

1168
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,735
I didn't really start

1169
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,015
Use cases

1170
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,551
Integra Technologies

1171
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:36,159
In the field and a safe and secure manner in order to really understand what works

1172
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,463
And the last thing that we did over all of this

1173
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,511
Build a really strong internal governance

1174
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,631
So that people at every level both were empowered to do work following after mayor Hancock

1175
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:51,263
Lead with Peak Academy was still getting direction to make sure that we're all part of what really makes the

1176
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,079
The City and County of Denver both work and

1177
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,615
Continue to improve

1178
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,175
Okay so what is your job and all

1179
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:05,855
So I think we are almost as if we're a startup within the City and County of Denver

1180
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,671
We really have is entrepreneurial lens

1181
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
And so I think I wear lots of

1182
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,511
Making sure that everybody has

1183
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
What they need

1184
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,351
Able to remove barriers from specific projects

1185
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
And then

1186
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,167
Doing the organizational ties

1187
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,703
To make sure that we're all working

1188
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:25,311
Words with the same goals and utilizing our best assets

1189
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
In the ice

1190
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,639
Ctd information and communication technology

1191
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,431
Space so that we're really growing

1192
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
Together

1193
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
Okay so

1194
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,271
Since you guys have created this system

1195
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,087
I'm really curious how if I were in your

1196
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
Department of Public

1197
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Healthfirst

1198
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,671
How I might go

1199
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,487
Talk to you guys about creating an air quality monitor

1200
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:49,119
We actually went through this about a year ago so the partnership started about 18

1201
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,703
So how we organized our program was amongst Florida

1202
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
Portfolio

1203
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,847
And we purposely have names that really about delivering value rather than

1204
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,151
Kind of a typical program and Department

1205
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,455
One of the portfolios is

1206
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:08,063
Healthy people and places and that portfolio manager was in

1207
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,855
The Department of Public Health and environment

1208
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,903
But his Focus really was in electric

1209
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,951
Vacation he had a colleague

1210
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:20,351
Who was interested in is an air quality expert and had a great idea this happened to coincide with the blind

1211
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,167
That happened last year that was

1212
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
The first round

1213
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,471
And so he brought

1214
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:31,871
This gentleman who had a great idea to the implementation team and our implementation team is kind of that mid-level

1215
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,895
Group of Representatives

1216
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
From the

1217
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
Apartments

1218
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
So the gentleman

1219
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
6 Michael Court

1220
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:42,111
They started talking about this idea he had about real-time hyperlocal air quality data

1221
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:46,463
And getting that information into the hands of parents and teachers and nurses

1222
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,535
So the team really looked at the effort force of impact

1223
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:55,167
What are current projects were and could we add value to even his idea where he was

1224
00:44:55,423 --> 00:45:01,567
And so we were able to push that forward to our Executives and our executive steering committee and they were

1225
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
Really interested

1226
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,615
So we all worked at

1227
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,151
Together bonjour

1228
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,687
The umbrella of

1229
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
A challenge for the Bloomberg mayor

1230
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,271
And submitted application

1231
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,063
And we're one of 35

1232
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,111
Cities who were awarded that proposal

1233
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,135
And so

1234
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:19,487
To give you a little bit more specific what we did is we help support some of the work here

1235
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,279
He was doing as part of a team

1236
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,303
He really focused

1237
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:28,447
Doing user-centered design so working with the principles and the teachers and the students

1238
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,751
To say what type of information

1239
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,567
What help you understand what air quality

1240
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,591
Even is

1241
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,383
And understanding that as it released

1242
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,175
2 for example stop idling

1243
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,223
An example is I have a friend

1244
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,503
Who is child ghost

1245
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,575
School downtown where we do have some congestion

1246
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
And she would like

1247
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,135
Additional information.

1248
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:50,207
Understand what days are good or bad for her son's practice

1249
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:57,375
In addition we know the air quality isn't just a local problem it doesn't stop at a border so we need to really work

1250
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,423
How we do this region Elite

1251
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,727
Really move the needle in a positive direction

1252
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,775
Hey we're going to move on to Regional stuff

1253
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
Moment but first

1254
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
Can you

1255
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,615
Give me a sense of the

1256
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
Procurement process

1257
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,943
This is it just like he had an idea

1258
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,015
And then he started talking to you guys and then y'all supported in throughout

1259
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,039
Getting data did you

1260
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:18,111
Like how do you choose vendors and something like this what is that look

1261
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,671
I don't think that there's a one-size-fits-all

1262
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,719
We do have a vendor in

1263
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:26,303
Partner also process form I do really

1264
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,607
I think that there's a lot of value in creating good process

1265
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,959
That way it doesn't just rely on me or somebody else but we start creating a system

1266
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:36,799
And I really do think that we're creating in so many ways are these system of systems

1267
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,591
What's not people and spread

1268
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,615
Sheets were talking

1269
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,151
And communicating in

1270
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,455
Kind of their own forms of Silence but working

1271
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:49,343
Together so if someone is interested in partnering with us for example they go to our website they fill out a form

1272
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,135
And then we go through a very

1273
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,671
Internal process

1274
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,487
Do you understand do we have any active funding that we can use

1275
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:00,095
Can we look at Nick future funding and try to partner with them

1276
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,143
Palace Pacific example Don air quality

1277
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:06,495
Air quality expert did some initial analysis the things that we

1278
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,543
Really wanted to understand

1279
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,335
We're really focused around

1280
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,639
Are four main focuses

1281
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,943
Mention this before but we wanted to make

1282
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:20,063
Make sure and when Michael Ogletree was starting to talk with Thunders you know do we understand local

1283
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:20,831
Control of data

1284
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,647
Can we base everything or most things on Oppa

1285
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,415
Open source node

1286
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,231
Can we look at Federal and Industry

1287
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,999
Standards to be

1288
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
Standard space

1289
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,071
And also are we looking interoperability

1290
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,351
Will you look at that

1291
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,655
About a year ago

1292
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:38,239
We started realizing that we wanted to partner with a starter

1293
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,823
Partnered with a local startup called lunar Outpost

1294
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,359
Tuco develop ascent

1295
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,919
It would really have this open data and

1296
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,455
Follow what we wanted

1297
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,479
To do in order to

1298
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,759
Create the speakers

1299
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,295
That's awesome

1300
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,623
Do you get a lot of pushback from vendors on your

1301
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,159
Things like Open Standards

1302
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,695
Data-sharing policy

1303
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,231
You know I think so

1304
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:05,631
The terror has been some really interesting transformation even in the last year for example I know

1305
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,727
Somebody was looking at a firm even a couple of years ago related to air quality

1306
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,519
And it's more of an ash

1307
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,591
And originally they really wanted to hold onto

1308
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:19,967
But I think at the industry talking about how it's an emerging industry is changing so rapidly and then

1309
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:24,575
People are understanding that interoperability and data sharing maybe that there's other ways

1310
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
Commoditized

1311
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,159
Beacon sites that are game for the value that is

1312
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,951
Skate or being that experts

1313
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,815
To help analyze the data but holding onto the data I don't think we're the only ones and realizing

1314
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,839
That doesn't

1315
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,119
Create a good system

1316
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,143
That is my son

1317
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,935
From where the industry is ice

1318
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,983
I think that there may be all over the board but

1319
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:47,103
People are understanding the value of sharing data and then understanding that there still other ways to

1320
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,639
Create Revenue

1321
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,687
Because Justice is still need to operate

1322
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,223
I can't think that we're all

1323
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:56,575
Here just doing work together for the betterment of people that's very important

1324
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:00,671
But part of our own economic Vitality is having good businesses

1325
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,463
Here in Denver in Colorado

1326
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,535
Got it okay well that actually segues nicely into

1327
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,863
A pretty big conversation that's happening right now in the Smart City space

1328
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,911
How do you guys think about

1329
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,191
User-data in

1330
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,471
Privacy because

1331
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,287
Do we really want all of this information gathered up and

1332
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,311
Possibly used

1333
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,847
That it's really important

1334
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,151
Considerate and not a Xanax

1335
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,943
What is a very basic

1336
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
Foundation and Howard building

1337
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:29,343
So when we are looking at about how we're going to manage data privacy

1338
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
Can security issue

1339
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,135
We think

1340
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,159
Key components

1341
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,207
Is maintaining ownership of our data

1342
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:36,255
To be able to address of privacy answer

1343
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,791
Security issues upfront

1344
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
And directly with our city park

1345
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,607
Understand our vendors

1346
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,167
But we try to do is be identified the data

1347
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,215
So we ensure that we work with are

1348
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,495
Protocol from

1349
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,031
National Organization

1350
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,847
Make sure that we're compliant with cjis

1351
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
HIPAA

1352
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,919
And other standards are already out there

1353
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,455
We're very careful with data in

1354
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:59,551
Making sure that if you need for example if

1355
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,319
Q

1356
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,623
Are trying to understand traffic patterns

1357
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,415
There's unique identifier

1358
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,207
That are given to have nothing

1359
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:08,511
Dude with anything that could be traced back

1360
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,047
Two color of a car

1361
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:13,375
Type of car definitely no data related

1362
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,911
To the person in the car

1363
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
A notch

1364
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:20,287
Really important because from the very start there's no way to correlate

1365
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
That

1366
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
Specifically with

1367
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,615
And then the last thing I just wanted

1368
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,943
Is it what really interested in understanding and creating the business

1369
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,247
Just want to leave any type of

1370
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,271
Possible

1371
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,807
PPI data at the edge

1372
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,879
So that we're bringing in MIDI either something that has a huge

1373
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:39,743
Deviation from the standard but we do that with aggregated or insights that comes

1374
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,023
From the information

1375
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:44,095
Rather than any of that data that could have PPI infer

1376
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:44,863
Formation

1377
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,423
And there's a lot of debate happening about like

1378
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,727
Hey data that doesn't feel like it might be

1379
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,007
Personally identifiable

1380
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,799
Could become identifiable

1381
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,591
Can a monitor my car if

1382
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:58,175
Coke this car always comes from this direction

1383
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,223
And holy cow we can establish a route back to

1384
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:00,991
To someone's house

1385
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,063
That is kind of crazy and out there but it is still something

1386
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,879
And I'm glad to see that you

1387
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,951
You guys try to be identify the data and are thinking about

1388
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:10,975
Control of it

1389
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,743
For those kind

1390
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,767
Future cases

1391
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,791
So ye onyame

1392
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,607
Just to kind of follow through on the vehicle LED

1393
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,655
So let's say I am going

1394
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
3 blocks

1395
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:22,495
In the same direction every day on Monday

1396
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,543
But I'm just using this is an example right

1397
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,079
My vehicle is

1398
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,103
3 2 1 5

1399
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:31,199
Right and maybe it's going through again we're doing some experiments around can

1400
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,223
Connected vehicle technology

1401
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:38,879
But in that one day within a 5-minute time it's 32516 the next morning I'm going in the same direction

1402
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,927
Possibly that vehicle is

1403
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,975
7321 and then the next

1404
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,791
Kinda goes through an intersection with in a very short. Time

1405
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
732

1406
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,839
Want to imagine

1407
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:51,935
Day today we need to all be responsible for the fact that we can't create the

1408
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,263
Same information from the same users in the same way

1409
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,799
But creating a

1410
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
Pattern

1411
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:02,687
It really is aggregated a higher-level to understand patterns rather than individuals

1412
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,479
Oh that's actually really great exam

1413
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,807
And I promise we get back to regionalism

1414
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,343
And I'd love to do that with

1415
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,903
Asportation cuz that's a really good example

1416
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,719
How people actually live I may

1417
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,535
Having experience in Denver but I might also be driving

1418
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,815
The boulder Inn

1419
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,887
Denver's only part of that I'm driving from the airport to Boulder Inn

1420
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,655
Again

1421
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,679
Denver's only part of that

1422
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,215
So how do you think about

1423
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:28,543
Expanding your program or even working with other

1424
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,103
Groups around the state or local areas

1425
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,895
Smarter region

1426
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,711
Yes AC that is a really great question

1427
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:40,063
Because no matter how smart or wise or intelligent Denver

1428
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,879
Either is or will be it is

1429
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,415
Pendant and it is

1430
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,439
Key importance

1431
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,231
Let me think about this regionally

1432
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,303
Just as I was talking about how air quality doesn't know the

1433
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,071
Boundaries

1434
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,119
I don't care whether it during

1435
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:53,887
Denver

1436
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,655
Boulder

1437
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,959
Or all of the borders that we share with

1438
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,751
Many cities and so

1439
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,287
What we really are doing

1440
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:04,383
Is creating and being a part of other Partnerships as well

1441
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,711
So two examples are the Colorado smart cities Alliance

1442
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:11,039
Which was formed by Denver south economic

1443
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:11,807
Partnership

1444
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,599
I think currently there's oversee

1445
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,927
Team cities around the state that are involved in this Alliance

1446
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:20,255
And it's not just an alliance with cities but it's also with

1447
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,815
University and private partners

1448
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:26,911
There was a recent Announcement by Arrow Electronics and in partnership with AECOM

1449
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,935
They're working on

1450
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,959
What time does Regional

1451
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,751
So we can all work

1452
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:34,079
Together with they also are really helping with that information share

1453
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:37,151
And then another really important organization

1454
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,479
That I wanted to talk about with our Denver Regional Council of governments

1455
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:43,551
So that is our local Municipal planning organization

1456
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,111
They are involved in many efforts

1457
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,135
But I really looking at this

1458
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,159
Smart Regional

1459
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,463
And then we're working with them

1460
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,303
What ideas could we have where we're learning from other cities

1461
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,167
Even things that they're doing in the region and then maybe there's things that we're doing for example in the

1462
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:03,263
Connected vehicle or open architecture space that they can learn from us

1463
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,543
So we're not saying This Is Us

1464
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:07,103
The standard this is information that we can all work on

1465
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,175
And then hopefully with those two organization

1466
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,223
We can really build on some

1467
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,247
Regional in

1468
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,271
Statewide

1469
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,039
Who calls

1470
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,087
That we can use and really learn from each other

1471
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:19,647
Not to share that information but grow with each

1472
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,951
Ellie the sounds great so

1473
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,231
Can you give me

1474
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,791
One project that you guys are Maybe

1475
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:29,375
Most proud of or maybe it's just simply that is most complete

1476
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:34,751
So thanks for asking Stacy I am really excited about what we're doing

1477
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,823
Around our living lab that we have on Federal Boulevard

1478
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,103
The Federal Boulevard

1479
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,383
Is

1480
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,151
Really

1481
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:41,919
Important

1482
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:45,247
Way for people to get to their homes into businesses

1483
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,783
In an area is

1484
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,343
Well where we have some of our most

1485
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,623
Spirit a health outcome

1486
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,647
Even around are

1487
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:56,511
Air quality and what we really realizes is by focusing in on this area

1488
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,559
We can really help understand

1489
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:02,143
What are the various things that we can do either small steps are big stuff

1490
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:02,911
2 mm

1491
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,703
Prove the experience of living

1492
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,751
Working and being around Federal Boulevard

1493
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,567
So specific UK sweetheart is around emerging

1494
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,591
NC vehicle preemption

1495
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:14,431
And our vehicles and station 12 which is it

1496
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,479
26th and federal there are

1497
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,759
Two major fire trucks

1498
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,575
And then there a chief has an SUV

1499
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,879
And when there's an emergency

1500
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,159
Re-Use

1501
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:24,927
System

1502
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,719
That emits a series of Lights

1503
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,743
To do preamp

1504
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:28,767
So that means

1505
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,047
For many of us

1506
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,071
When a vehicle

1507
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,119
Pecans we don't actually

1508
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:38,751
Really know where it's coming from and we're using the sights and sound to try to figure out where they are and then the light often

1509
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,031
Quickly changes for them

1510
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,567
That's needed for tourism

1511
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:45,663
Just wanted to clear traffic out of the way and then it helps them get through to where they need

1512
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:49,759
What we are really using is this new connected vehicle technology

1513
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:53,343
Call dsrc which is dedicated shortwave communication

1514
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,391
Directly

1515
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,671
Communicate with the signals

1516
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,695
Signal the signal

1517
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,231
This is really important

1518
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:03,071
Because they often turn off whether it's based on traffic or other things

1519
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:06,399
In two other roads and so we want to make sure that they're able

1520
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,727
Keto signal by signal and get the right information that they need

1521
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,263
A really key component

1522
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
Is actually the

1523
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,359
Two-way communication that this new technology will alpha

1524
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:20,223
So what they'll be able to do if they'll actually be able to see the signal information

1525
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:23,039
How many more seconds until it turns green

1526
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,319
And other information

1527
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,903
Directly back into their vehicles which will help them make better decisions

1528
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:34,047
In addition by the signal the signal changes what that'll do is it it will hopefully disrupt the network left

1529
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,071
So that means

1530
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:39,167
Sometimes when an emergency vehicle comes through like a fire truck it can take hours

1531
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:39,935
Florida

1532
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,471
People to get back

1533
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,519
To the normal pattern of the road

1534
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,591
Until we think that there's going to be a faster turnaround time

1535
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,919
Between when an emergency happens and when people can continue

1536
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,199
To go where they need to go

1537
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,991
In a manner that deficient

1538
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:53,759
And also safe

1539
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:54,783
Awesome

1540
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,063
Anything to get me out of trash

1541
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,647
All right we'll Emily thanks so much for coming on the show this

1542
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
