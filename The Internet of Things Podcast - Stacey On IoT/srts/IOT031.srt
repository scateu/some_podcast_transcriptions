00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,984
Hey everyone welcome to

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,520
The Internet of Things podcast

3
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,288
Stye in your eye

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,824
Stacey Higginbotham

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,360
And here is my co-host

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,640
Kevin tofel

7
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,944
And today we are going to talk about

8
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:19,968
A lot of things

9
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,760
Including our SmartThings

10
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,552
Review part 1

11
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,088
We're going to talk about

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,928
Creating a checklist for your smart home when you move

13
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,768
Verizon and its new booze for

14
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,536
I don't know

15
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,584
Building a business on the Internet of Things

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
Yeah that sounds great

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,168
Good luck with that

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,008
They've already made almost half a billion dollars so far at this

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,056
Year that's pretty impressive

20
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,848
I'm excited because they really haven't

21
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,176
Big leaps into the space yet so that's good

22
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,224
Yes but they decided it was not good enough

23
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
So

24
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,272
I'll tell you more about what their

25
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
But first

26
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,392
I know you guys are eager to hear about my experience with SmartThings

27
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,464
Which I am sad to say so far

28
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,000
Has not been awesome

29
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
What wire

30
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,072
Yeah

31
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:13,216
This this is already considering to me I don't have the details yet because as I said on the show in the past

32
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,520
If wink kind of goes away

33
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:21,408
My number one hugged and system goes away and SmartThings is going to be my

34
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
Backup plan

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,992
Prepare to to Tinker

36
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,320
I believe is one of the reviewers said

37
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
So

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368
Here's the deal

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,744
SmartThings had sent me a review unit early on in October I was in Harry Potter

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
World

41
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,328
At Universal Studios hugging minions and having a

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
Jolly good time

43
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
Which by the way

44
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,448
They have these awesome ones

45
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
At Harry Potter World

46
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:50,336
Proprietary technology

47
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,152
But I think they would make so much Bank

48
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
If

49
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
You know you buy these ones

50
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,528
And they had something like NFC or zigbee or

51
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,320
Bluetooth or anything in them

52
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
And when you got home

53
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
You could like Point them

54
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
At a senior house

55
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,000
And you could say something like Wingardium Leviosa

56
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
Open your blinds

57
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,096
That's that's interesting

58
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,704
Proprietary no because it's Hogwarts magic so you know they're not going to do something standard

59
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,008
But that would be cool kind of

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,360
Pointing at the device you want to control and then leveraging what I called the

61
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,408
Invisible interface to voice

62
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,296
Or she we should wait a second we should we should build a business around this hang on a second

63
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
Seaweed have to

64
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
Play JK Rowling

65
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
But

66
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
I think

67
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
How magical would that be

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
This is my business plan that unfortunately

69
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
Involves paying license

70
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
To somebody

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,192
Get rid of all those silly Way chords We have forever always devices you know

72
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,240
Exactly you could do your whole home in like

73
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
Harry Potter or is she or you know

74
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Until 8

75
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
The Hobbit or something like that

76
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
You are precious

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,248
You could be like Gandalf I don't know what does he have like actual magic words or what I have to learn Elvish

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,832
Well he doesn't have his own they are there typically Elvish yes

79
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
How scary is it

80
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Okay

81
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,000
Now that we have totally out of our cells is

82
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
Crazy crazy

83
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,120
Hanging lights up my Middle Earth map of Psyduck

84
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,192
Active

85
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
SmartThings

86
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
All right

87
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
What I

88
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,128
So so having had this II started out

89
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,432
Trying to get devices online

90
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,760
And in this took me a long time because every time I encountered a snag

91
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,040
Being

92
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
Someone add I would just say

93
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,696
Well while I wait for this to connect all go play with this other two

94
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,512
What devices today include by the way

95
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
SmartThings sent me

96
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
Diversion to Hub

97
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
And

98
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,704
What they called their monitoring kit the monitoring kit contain

99
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,264
To open close sensors

100
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
To the new smaller open close sensors

101
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
A

102
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
Motion detector

103
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
And an outlet

104
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
They also sent me a siren

105
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
A water sensor

106
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
And Samsung

107
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
IP camera

108
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
Those are not cheap and

109
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,256
They also sent me a roll of really sticky double-sided 3M tape

110
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
Which is very

111
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,375
That was the entire package that I got

112
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
I don't know the

113
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,959
Retail value of all of the stuff the

114
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
Home monitoring kit which contained

115
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,079
Before sensors and the connected home

116
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,639
Was I believe

117
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
249

118
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
Right right

119
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,319
And in all of these products that they sent you for who you are available to purchase and are shipping to Consumers now

120
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
They are all available in China

121
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
One more quick question

122
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,231
Homekit or no homekit support

123
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
Just clarified okay

124
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,583
SmartThings The Hub support zigbee

125
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
Z-Wave

126
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Bluetooth

127
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Wi-Fi

128
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
Those are those are your radio

129
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
Okay

130
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,311
A wonderful wonderful option and I've had version 1 of this in my home

131
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
For like

132
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
Two and a half years and I love it

133
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
It's

134
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Lighthouse version 2

135
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
Version 2

136
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
So when I

137
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,903
Connect so the connection also did a completely fresh

138
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,743
Refresh like a fresh connection I did not try to upgrade

139
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
From version 1

140
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Conversion to

141
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,607
Upon their advice they said

142
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
Don't do that

143
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
It's pretty

144
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,215
And that's actually Fair because I don't think

145
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
Most people buying this

146
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,079
Have already SmartThings Hub in all the other fun stuff

147
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
Okay so

148
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,431
That's enough if you have it and you want to do

149
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
A

150
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,271
Versionone to to refresh let me know how that goes for you

151
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
Good luck with that

152
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
No I am very curious

153
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
So my

154
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
So I made a brand new account

155
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
And

156
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
The setup itself

157
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
Very easy of the Hub

158
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
I had my account

159
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
All is well

160
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
And then

161
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
I started adding sensors

162
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,031
And it was very quick it was like hey do you want us to find sensors

163
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
You clicked yes

164
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
I think you click next

165
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,919
And then it started looking for sensors

166
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
At that point it found

167
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,319
Two of the four sensors for me and found the motion sensor and wanted the open closed sign

168
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
Atlantic capital

169
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,183
In about 5 minutes into that process I kind of got bored

170
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,023
What did it not find

171
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,583
It did not find one of the open closed sign

172
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
Sensors

173
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
And it did not find the outlet

174
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
So

175
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,519
That's kind of where things stood for a while I also added the camera

176
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
Dad the camera

177
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
You actually set up the camera on its own

178
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
And then you added that

179
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
Like you would any

180
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:50,879
Normal secondary device so smart things the benefit of smart things is that it's a very open and it's app

181
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
Import hundreds of

182
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
Outside devices

183
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,487
So Dad the camera

184
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
You would just

185
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
Find it as a supported device

186
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,375
And you went into like their security section

187
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,935
There's a section for cameras and it's

188
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
Centos supported there like Samsung

189
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,567
And that again makes sense to me as well because

190
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,455
The setup process would require getting the camera and IP address on your network and you know getting that connectivity going on

191
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,783
That it would be able to actually use the camera so that that's fine

192
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
Yes and this is the first version to is the first

193
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
SmartThings Hub support

194
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Cameras

195
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
Why it's different

196
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
Special

197
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:34,143
I have trouble with the camera and I don't know if it's smart things or if it's Samsung or what the

198
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
WhatsApp

199
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,983
Hold up is now Samsung does own SmartThings

200
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
So I kind of find a surprising

201
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103
You have to enter like many things

202
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,663
Do you want any Kate when you're trying to connect to

203
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
Separate devices

204
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
With a password

205
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
Some reason

206
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
My password just wasn't accepted

207
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,439
So I did a hard reset of camera twice to try to

208
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Make sure that I was

209
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
Skating at the right path

210
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
But I was

211
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
That was frustrate

212
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,447
That was one of the frustration

213
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,263
I'm so I still haven't yet

214
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Scene

215
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
The camera

216
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,895
Inside smart things I seen the camera outside SmartThings and it's a lovely camera

217
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,223
I guess it what you just go to a IP address of the

218
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,783
Cameron web browser

219
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
I didn't I didn't get so fancy

220
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Passcode on iPad

221
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,975
CNN typically only cuz I have a couple IP webcam

222
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
Get there fast games are old

223
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,631
When I look through the browser if the same thing you still have to sign into thumbtack

224
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Which Wich

225
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
Make sense from security standpoint

226
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Yes you

227
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
Secure home camera

228
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
Forever

229
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,407
Sometimes I do sometimes the cats and dogs really

230
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,711
Sometimes put on quite a show but you're right most people don't

231
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
Online faces my back

232
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
So this is it this is my use case that I was trying to monitor

233
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,135
The goal of setting this up with

234
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
Again my dog is escaping

235
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
She's very very good at that

236
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,303
So I set up my motion detector by the dog door

237
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,911
So when she walks out the dog door it would trigger the camera to start recording

238
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,519
And since it's facing the backyard I'm trying to figure out which hole in the fence she's getting through this time

239
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
And then

240
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,615
So that's that's my goal

241
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
I haven't achieved it yet

242
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
There's Hope

243
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,759
What's the savers on we're going to get there

244
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,855
So I can let the dogs figured it out and change the password on you but that's just

245
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
I know

246
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
That that was first issue

247
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,535
So when I came back to it a couple of light

248
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,559
I thought I took a

249
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,119
Wii cost basically for messing with this in

250
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
But when I came back to it

251
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
I was like

252
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
Let's try it again Daddy sensors

253
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:52,383
So this time instead of doing be kind of generic just find whatever is available I went to add them individually

254
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
That also did not work

255
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
So

256
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
The outlet

257
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,831
They came with it is a zigbee outlet so I moved it closer to the hub

258
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
Hoping that would help

259
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
How close

260
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
5 feet of the Hub

261
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,487
Observation connection

262
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
And I press the little button so

263
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
Light is blinking everything is good

264
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
It didn't connect

265
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
So

266
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
Not sure what's going on there

267
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:23,871
And just to clarify this is not a third-party generic zigbee switch this is an actual Samsung SmartThings

268
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Sprint

269
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,711
Yashow SmartThings this came within the Hub

270
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
Open close sensor that did not connect

271
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,695
I don't know how to force it to connect I took out the battery to try to

272
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Force

273
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
A new connection

274
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
It's so far has not

275
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
So we're going to

276
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
I don't that may just be a

277
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
A dead sensor

278
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
I don't come

279
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
I also tried to

280
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,239
Connect a couple of my devices

281
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
And that

282
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
Didn't work

283
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,919
I tried to connect those to the wink Hub to make sure that those devices were not

284
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,223
Fault is it connected to the wink hub

285
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
And then I

286
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
Disconnected them for the wink Hub 2

287
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,111
Because you can't have things connecting on multiple Networks

288
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,415
And then tried again to connect

289
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
Candismart things and they still weren't ready

290
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
Those received wave device

291
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,607
What about the open close sensor that is

292
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
Seen by The Hub

293
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,191
And the open close sensor that is seen by The Hub

294
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Is always open

295
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
Even though right now it is

296
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
Technically supposed to

297
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
So

298
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
So what's working

299
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,479
So I have a working motion sensor

300
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,295
Yeah I have also added my Hue Lights

301
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
And they work

302
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,623
They are controllable and they're very lovely

303
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,719
My Sonos has also we're seen that's a

304
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,303
SmartThings has a Labs feature which means it's kind of

305
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
We have to stay together and

306
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
That sort of

307
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
So that works

308
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
I added my ecobee but it's not showing up

309
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,359
But it technically is supported so I'm not sure what's going on there

310
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
And so

311
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
Right now

312
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
Yes I feel that

313
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
This is not

314
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
A great

315
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Experience

316
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
SmartThings is not so smart right now

317
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
But

318
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Have a hopes

319
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,695
I have hopes that I either have a really bad hub

320
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
And that I will replace the Hub and

321
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Work

322
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Or I got like a

323
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,167
Sensor that went through like an EMP on the way to my house

324
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
I don't know

325
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
But we'll figure it out

326
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
Because

327
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
In the past SmartThings has been amazing

328
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
The software update

329
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:37,503
I've used it actually with my older SmartThings gear because the software update came out

330
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,319
Prior to me getting the Hub and I upgraded it

331
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
With my new stuff

332
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
With my old stuff

333
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
And it was

334
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
It was great

335
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
Let me ask you a question that

336
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,279
The old house that you have that everything's been working well

337
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,559
You Got It upgraded

338
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
Do these new devices

339
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
What should these new devices work with the old hub

340
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
I don't know because I didn't

341
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
Want to mess with

342
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
Theoretically I'm thinking they should

343
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
Theoretically they should because

344
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
The old

345
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,479
Hope still supports those radios

346
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
Yasso

347
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,319
Temperature is and I know it's time-consuming for you

348
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:17,951
Pictures if these sensors that are not connect to the new Hub acts like you connect to the old Hub that's been software upgraded

349
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
I will

350
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
Try that after I

351
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,863
Yeah they come and give Stacey homework

352
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,423
After I get through this

353
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,519
I've been trying to avoid the SmartThings support Beyond

354
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,359
Basic stuff because I don't want to get special Lake

355
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,455
Right yeah but we weren't us all the time as reviewers you know once

356
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,271
The company finds out your own problems they attach a special

357
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
Team 10

358
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,135
Fixed up as quickly as possible but consumers don't have that

359
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,231
So I try and do that what you're doing go through the standard support process and

360
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
And so on

361
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,583
Maybe on their help forums we're kind of a little more anonymous

362
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
UE

363
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,655
Their health forms are good

364
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
And I have online chat

365
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,263
Inspire things actually has great

366
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Like

367
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,823
Normal people

368
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,871
SmartThings will get people

369
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
But people will call you

370
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
As a norm

371
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,479
A person if you're having a lot of trouble

372
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,783
They actually will get some

373
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Someone to call you in

374
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
Think so it's not

375
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
It's not like wynk that has a

376
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
Support line that you can call

377
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,231
Read after you've gone through like a support forum

378
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
Iran chat

379
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
Everyone scratching their heads they're like

380
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
We're calling

381
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,239
So it's it's not too crazy but I'm kind of to the point where they

382
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
I really have done it

383
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Thanks

384
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,127
Well and you have more patience than most because this is

385
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
You know that's what we do

386
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,735
9 and 4 standard everyday mainstream consumers

387
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:49,343
If they had gone through what you've gone through right now I think they probably would return the device at this point

388
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,671
I think a normal consumer probably would have returned the device after

389
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
The sensors were not found

390
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
Like in the beginning

391
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,815
Which is when I stopped and started adding

392
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Other devices of mine

393
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
And it started like

394
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,167
Sure actually broken

395
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,799
Cuz you said it could be just a bad Hub it could be

396
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
Something that's a one-off

397
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
Hardware issue

398
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,455
But to me is somebody was considering the purchase of this cuz I am

399
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,527
Just like I said I mean if one goes away this is my

400
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
My next best choice for me

401
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
I'm not

402
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
Turn up the lights yet

403
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
Well you don't have to

404
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,695
Because I have a spare hub

405
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,999
That's even better good news

406
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,839
So yes if it is if it does turn out I haven't pulled out the spare hub yet

407
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
I really thought the

408
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,983
Well I also think there are some sensory issues here so hot

409
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
Couldn't even spot that Hub out

410
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
If you do nothing else

411
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
Cuz it could be that

412
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
That is the neck

413
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
Good

414
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
Next week

415
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
Maybe I'll be like

416
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,807
It was the EMP at the post office

417
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,903
So now I will figure this out and

418
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,511
Maybe next week I'll be singing the Praises and you guys should all rush out and buy one but not the one that I bought

419
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,583
One of those thought or question hero I have not I was

420
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
Traveling yesterday and

421
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:12,287
Busy on Monday I have not read other reviews of this new product I'm assuming there are some out there and I'm curious if other people have

422
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,103
Praise this or have had similar problems

423
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
So the reviews are really mixed in

424
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
The professional reviews

425
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,551
Haven't really said that the hardware is good the software

426
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Is iffy

427
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Which

428
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
It's kind of

429
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
That's been my

430
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:32,255
Previous experience with this so I was like that's what I kind of expected

431
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,583
The Amazon customer reviews who said that

432
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,143
Getting this online has actually been tough

433
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,471
And then there's the typical five stars that are like gray product

434
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
So

435
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,311
The reviews are little

436
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
The place quite honestly

437
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,967
Happened to review the challenge of getting it online and working

438
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,295
And some of them have been kind of like prepare to Tinker

439
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,367
So I don't I don't really know what to say about that

440
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
Other than

441
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,463
This my experience may not be that unusual

442
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
And that

443
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
Seems to be kind of ominous

444
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
So that's

445
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
That's why I try not to read reviews too much

446
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Before I go into

447
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
Same here

448
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Because

449
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,335
But once I once I start experiencing trouble then I'm like okay

450
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
It's just me

451
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
What's happening

452
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
So that's that

453
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Stay tuned

454
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,759
Next week hopefully

455
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
Will have a new Hub Maybe

456
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,599
Or maybe I'll have fixed all of this

457
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,671
Maybe it's maybe it's the foil I wrap my hubby

458
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,767
I would say anybody who is thinking about buying this you may want to wait till next week show

459
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
Or just a

460
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
Definitely wait till they

461
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
Okay so

462
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,447
Enough time I'm at let's talk about

463
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
CIO magazine

464
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,823
Cover this and I'm glad they did because we covered this before but

465
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
I know I do this existed but

466
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,943
The OT aide online trust Alliance put out a check list

467
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,783
Things you should do if you have Smart devices in your home and you're about to

468
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
To move

469
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,367
And I'll put a link to it in the show notes

470
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
But it's

471
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
It's pretty cool right

472
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:10,815
This this is a pretty comprehensive list and honestly when I have my house for sale last year I kept

473
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,887
On my to-do list make a list of all the things you need to

474
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,423
Pull out of the house or

475
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,239
Reset passwords for its own because

476
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,079
With all these gadgets and things hooked up into the home that somebody is buying

477
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,663
You can't leave them high and dry where they have all these smart switches and the

478
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
You're not working cuz I don't have access

479
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,759
You certainly don't want your old data available to the

480
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
To the new buyer

481
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,391
If there's a ton of stuff and I didn't really realize until I saw this OTA checklist

482
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
Yasso

483
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,463
Some things on here like

484
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,511
Again will give you the complete list but

485
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
Things like

486
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,839
Modems gateways hubs

487
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,911
Like in some of this you got to think like are you going to pull out

488
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
Your Nest right

489
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,495
Leaving to pull out your connector garage door

490
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,335
So you got to think about book passwords but then also resetting that make

491
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Making sure they can't get to the day

492
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
Those are probably the big things

493
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
Connected switches

494
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,295
Which I have site mean they're hardwired in

495
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,111
Yeah so it's same here like all my Lutron switches

496
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
I like do I

497
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,695
Do you give him like the Lutron

498
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
Bridge do you tell him hey

499
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
If you want to control these from the internet

500
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,887
The nice thing about my switches and probably yours are they still work as switches even if you don't

501
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Correct

502
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,495
So big they work like normal switches

503
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
And

504
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,055
I guess technically anything that's

505
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:29,151
Part of the home when you're actually selling the home should go to the buyer unless you

506
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:34,015
Work out something so I guess what we will do cuz we will still be moving just

507
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
After waiting for the kids to finish up High School

508
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,415
You know I think what we'll do is we'll just negotiating said do you want these

509
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,487
If so we'll leave the man that will make sure that you have passwords and all that

510
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,791
As a buyer I guess I'd be concerned out

511
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:50,911
G are these people going to still have access to the things after they're gone I mean

512
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,239
You know it's probably a conversation that actually need to be had

513
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,823
In a way it's kind of like I don't know about you but like I have a

514
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,895
I have a list like in case I die with all of my

515
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,991
Not as social media but email credit cards all those passwords that are there for

516
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
My husband

517
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,087
You kind of have to create something like that for your house

518
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
But happy thought

519
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,719
I know you're right I mean

520
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
Morbidity

521
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,791
You're absolutely right I mean

522
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
Otherwise you know it's like

523
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,703
You're gone and then the family is like I don't know how to turn these lights on anymore I mean

524
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
Seriously that's that's kind of crazy

525
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
And you have to remember like

526
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
What are these light bulbs

527
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
Bright

528
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:38,527
Laika the last item in here is like disable connectivity for devices no longer supported by the manufacturer or replace them

529
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
Holy crap

530
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:46,463
Cuz in 10 years am I going to still remember who made my LEDs that are now like halfway through their life cycle

531
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,047
So this will leave in here

532
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
It's a great topic

533
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Conversation

534
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
For you

535
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,959
Great kind of thing where you're like in the middle of moving now I'm going to have to think about like

536
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:03,615
Having a conversation and remembering all the passwords associated with all of my connected devices some of which I may not even remember

537
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
All right

538
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
And now

539
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,967
We should get to

540
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
Verizon

541
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
What are they doing

542
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
2

543
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,111
Verizon on Wednesday

544
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
Is set to announce because today is Wednesday

545
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
Is set to announce a

546
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
Kind of effort

547
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
2

548
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,840
No that is not a word that is not over

549
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,376
What's a boost

550
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,168
It's internet of things kind of

551
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,472
Revenue Generation by creating

552
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,752
What it cost tools

553
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
So what it's doing is kind of

554
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,224
It is launching a cloud platform called thingspace it'll compete with Amazon's Internet of Things

555
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,344
Cloud IBM's internet-of-things cloud and all these other Internet of Things clouds that are out there

556
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
How many clouds

557
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
Houdini cloud

558
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,232
It is going to have like

559
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,024
It's basically a place where developers can

560
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,632
Point there are things at and send data and then build apps against

561
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
That's pretty like normal

562
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Right everyone

563
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:05,568
But the cool thing that's pretty specific to Verizon is that is partnered with sequins

564
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
Sequence the Moto Maker

565
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,456
And it's going to offer modems LTE modems for

566
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,760
Basically half the price of an LTE modem

567
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,808
So about 15 bucks

568
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,648
Really high but it's not as high as it could be

569
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,696
And that's that's important

570
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
Because

571
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:27,584
Cellular modems are expensive much more expensive than Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modems

572
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
And that

573
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:33,728
Really adds to the cost of any sort of device that you really want to build that

574
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,288
Go anywhere and be always on

575
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,592
And it's one of the reasons why

576
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
We don't get a lot of trackers that

577
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
Doesn't depend on

578
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
You know your phone

579
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
And

580
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
Petition

581
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
They're also going to be

582
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
Doing

583
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:52,160
Different profiles and data plans for quote-unquote things

584
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,720
Verizon did not get specific

585
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
About the type

586
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,816
Data plans that it can offer unfortunately

587
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:04,448
But it is willing to negotiate which is kind of an unusual stance for it because prior to this it wasn't

588
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
So

589
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,592
If you're planning on making a connected Pet Tracker

590
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,152
Please please because again my dog

591
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,200
She's got an escape at some point in time

592
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,760
And I would love to be able to follow her beyond the

593
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Wi-Fi network

594
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,808
Because right now

595
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
I cannot

596
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
In a cellular modem on her collar would be

597
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
Great for that

598
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
Alipay

599
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,488
Maybe a slightly different subscription fee

600
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
Alright what wait hold the phone for a second

601
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,888
Because I was joking about this two weeks ago on Twitter but it actually exists

602
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,960
There is a cellular caller

603
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,800
For Pet's they actually showed a video of it with cats but

604
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,640
It's literally a phone its GPS and a speaker in microphone

605
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,944
And it's on the collar of the animal

606
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
And you can track where they go and then you can

607
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
Speak it up and you can hear what they hear

608
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
I was at the meow meow thing

609
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,696
I don't recall what I was laughing so hard when I saw the Cat video of a cat being told

610
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,256
Is it like that French video and it's the woman's eye

611
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Where are you

612
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,072
Yes that's exactly what it is

613
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,888
I did see that I wish that does exist

614
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,424
And that might

615
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
I don't know if your dog listens when you

616
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,776
You know tell her to stay or come inside but

617
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
I will cuz I can help you

618
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,408
No but you know at least I could see her she said she'll come back eventually

619
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
It is it's more just like

620
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
She's not being

621
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
My coyote

622
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,648
Yeah that's not something you want to hear on a cell phone

623
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Ocado

624
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
Oh my God

625
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,096
Total Downer of a show

626
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:42,496
Oster digital will you pass away if your family don't forget to listen to your dog being eaten over the phone

627
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,312
Yasso

628
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,128
Let's just go straight to the guest

629
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
Because of happy guests

630
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,992
It is we're talking about saving energy and

631
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,272
Commercials buildings

632
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,880
I'm a guest is the CEO of enlighted his name is Joe Costello

633
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
He has

634
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
Actually two cool things

635
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
That he's going to talk about 1

636
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
Is

637
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,560
Saving energy in commercial spaces

638
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
Hbac

639
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
And then he's talking about actually

640
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,704
Doing a b testing in the real world

641
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
Space

642
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,800
And like the number of people in an office space

643
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,592
And I actually enjoyed it

644
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
A big nerd

645
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
Discovered from the beginning of the show

646
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,016
So I wish I could say goodbye to you in Elvish can you say goodbye in Elvish Kevin

647
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
I could but I want to

648
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
There we go

649
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,488
We will not say goodbye in Elvish or Klingon or any of the other languages that

650
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,024
But you know

651
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
You can you can say in your head if you

652
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:43,936
So instead we'll go with and stay tuned for

653
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:50,336
Joe Costello the CEO of enlighted

654
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:54,688
Today's guests I have Joe Costello

655
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,992
Who is president CEO of enlighted

656
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
Hi Joe how are you doing today

657
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,600
Fantastic Stacy thanks for inviting us

658
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,160
I am super excited to have you we have talked

659
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,952
Bunch of times about enlighted

660
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,024
And this is a company you guys that makes

661
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,608
It makes LEDs for corporate space so

662
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,704
I was going to say Enterprise space but that is not really a thing so

663
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,496
You make it for commercial buildings

664
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
And

665
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:25,152
You don't just jammed lights up there you also Jam all kinds of sensors up there so Joe you want to tell us a little bit

666
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,968
More about enlighted and what you can do with that

667
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
Yes

668
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:34,624
It's actually everything perfect for your show or Internet of things for commercial real estate

669
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
Is the best way to die

670
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Describe it

671
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:41,024
And we put a sensor Network into the ceiling of the building

672
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,352
That's what brings that building into the Internet of Things

673
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,144
And in fact we attached

674
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,984
1 sensor module to every light fixture almost every life

675
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,384
And the light fixture gives the little sensor module power and it's also great for position because if you have one of them

676
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,504
Light fixture it almost guarantees you see every square inch of the buildings ejaculate every square inch of the building

677
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:06,112
And so we got the power in the place from the light and we give the light back a brain

678
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
To send every life we give a little

679
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,976
Piece of a processor that's inside the sensor to the lights

680
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
To control the lights

681
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,792
And optimize

682
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,352
The lightning function as well as energy

683
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
And we typically say

684
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,472
About two-thirds 67% of the energy

685
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:27,872
It is used before we install the network we reduce 67% of the light energy used in buildings

686
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:34,272
Typically it is that because you transfer in addition to doing the sensors and all the benefits that provides you also do an

687
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
LED instead of

688
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,832
Incandescent light

689
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:41,696
Looking really interesting you get a kind of a double whammy typically in a typical installation

690
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
Is

691
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,864
You'll get about two-thirds of the reduction of whatever the energy whatever lighting that you put in once you install

692
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Are censored

693
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,680
But most most of the time

694
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,008
We actually put in LEDs at the same time you get even

695
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
Morning savings

696
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:00,128
Because of this is a savings you get from the LED so there's kind of the two factors

697
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,920
There's going for fluorescence

698
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:08,064
Two LEDs that gives you savings and then there is the savings you get by putting in our senses which takes it even father

699
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,160
Okay and Those sensors were going to tell you a little bit I'm sure

700
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,720
About some of the things that Those sensors and Evil

701
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
So

702
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,304
Couple things were going to talk about today which is

703
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,096
You guys have a brand new deal

704
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,888
We're not going to go too much into that

705
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,192
But it'll be a good kind of example of

706
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,032
What you guys can do and then I want to talk about financing

707
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,336
Because you have a really cool model so

708
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
As a use case

709
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:38,272
Let's talk about jll facilities management company in your two new apps because this will give people a really clear understanding

710
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:41,856
Standing of how you guys kind of get the savings and what you do

711
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,136
For a customer

712
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,768
Yeah exactly I think it's it kind of tells the whole story so the sensor Network that we put in

713
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,584
Is really about Gathering data

714
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,144
On the entire building

715
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:58,240
Obviously the lighting in it but also the temperature

716
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:02,592
And then everything going on inside the building all the human activity

717
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
People

718
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
Assets equipment so

719
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,200
The sensors are being put in

720
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
Not

721
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,248
Just to control lighting

722
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,856
Lightning is just a very small subset of what the data that you get from the Sun

723
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
Duke

724
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,976
This isn't this information your gathering on the building the building environment can be used

725
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,256
For all kinds of things

726
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,072
Yes lighting this is a great first application

727
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:28,960
And it's wonderful because we save so much energy that is essentially cost justifies the installation of the net

728
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:35,104
But once you get that sensor Network any build other applicants. That's exactly what we are announcing today

729
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,384
Is the first

730
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,408
Public Announcement

731
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
Other half

732
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:45,856
Which is our application which allows you to control your HVAC system using this data

733
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:51,488
In space which is a tool that enables people typically real estate real estate management people

734
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,560
To manage their space and figure out how well or

735
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,352
Hopefully it is utilized

736
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,656
Okay so are is

737
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,216
Dive out there other companies who

738
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,544
Do Air Management there's like building robotics is kind of

739
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,848
Lets people control their own air

740
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,200
Kind of temperature controls now this is measuring temperature up at the lighting level

741
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
And

742
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,016
It's basically saying hey

743
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,808
Your cooling an area right now

744
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,624
The people aren't in and that's where the savings come in

745
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,720
Connor different ways you can save energy in HVAC

746
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,744
Systems just like

747
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,048
Lady one of them is what you said

748
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
Around

749
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,400
Drunk me I'm cool and beat the heck out of the states

750
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,192
Because it scares that worthwhile attempt

751
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,728
And let's talk about

752
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
Space

753
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,288
So you have

754
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,336
In addition to are you have space What is

755
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:46,272
So this is really interesting to get a whole different now

756
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Energy-savings

757
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,600
Kitchen lighting in HVAC

758
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:53,696
Is giving real estate people in space planners as they're described

759
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232
The ability to

760
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,512
Real time

761
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
All the time

762
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,096
Exactly how their facilities being used

763
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,192
How many people are in every single space every single minute of the day

764
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,104
But no such data exist today

765
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,664
When you talk to those people about the day-to-day use

766
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,248
They actually use about two things they never one batch data

767
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
Did the person come to work

768
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,576
If you have no idea where they are

769
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,928
Then the second thing they do is they do study for people walk around

770
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,768
Literally either with no tags or the beginning of a nation is with an iPad

771
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,376
And then you go into each room and area and count the number of people at a certain time of day

772
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
I keep walking

773
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:41,824
That's the day that they use a one-time event of someone walking around the county people

774
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
What you say

775
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,128
Breezy inaccurate sister

776
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,296
Have the actual real time Dairy all the time every single day

777
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:55,904
There's a gigantic leap in the information they can use for planning their space are there real estate

778
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:59,488
Buescher in once you have this and you start looking at this

779
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,536
You can take it a step further and

780
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,144
Well you can kind of put the space planners possibly out of a job bye-bye

781
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,472
I starting to recommend things to

782
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
Space planners or

783
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
People like

784
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
Oh

785
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
For a

786
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,384
White-collar consulting firm

787
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,688
In this type of Sophos setup

788
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,992
This is the amount of space you need

789
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:27,136
Yes but you know what the interesting thing is all the space planners absolutely love

790
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
This capability

791
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:33,024
And I get on their passionate about it when they see this week we've been in beta for

792
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,560
Almost a year with a lot of

793
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Customers

794
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,168
It when they see the Olympics

795
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,192
And playing with it

796
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
Mitsubishi

797
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,688
If you been in space By Any professional your whole life

798
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,224
You get an instinct

799
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,832
Thanks you have a feeling about what you smell use not well used what the needs are

800
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,392
And he said it so we have no idea who that by the way

801
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
Your product

802
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,208
It's great that you weigh more

803
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,048
A whole nother level

804
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,352
We actually have a decent idea about

805
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,424
States that are grossly underutilized

806
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:18,848
Comedians and we talked to

807
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:24,224
Put these two different floors and buildings together and save a whole bunch of a real estate rental or whatever

808
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,248
And up

809
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,064
It happens is he getting a meeting

810
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
And it's all politics

811
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:35,488
Is that some corporate vice president with the Henderson group or general manager that's a bunch of baloney

812
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:41,888
You know my guys know we have just barely in a space we can't cut down you don't want to ruin people's productivity and janz connect

813
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,776
The problem in this business is it's never been data-driven

814
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,312
To have the data

815
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,640
Show people and make a data-driven in fact

816
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,712
Is a true Revolution it's what we've been waiting for our whole life

817
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,040
Okay and that makes sense that a lot of things

818
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
I think

819
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,392
Being data-driven is going to change a lot of them

820
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,184
Discussions and

821
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,792
Want to see how it really affects the people who are working there maybe it won't

822
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,168
You find about this is that

823
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,960
Misconception

824
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,496
You're one of the things you find

825
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,312
If you're coming out next year with a product run conference

826
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
Conference

827
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,360
Dirty test

828
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Real estate

829
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,904
The truth is when you look at the actual data

830
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,952
That's usually not true

831
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,280
The conference rooms actually aren't that well utilized

832
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:45,632
What is really going on

833
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
And

834
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,680
The problem is

835
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,008
Didn't order to manage conference rooms people set of bookends

836
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:57,408
And then what people do in order to make sure they have a room is they overbook and of course that creates more of a book

837
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,760
Conference rooms look like

838
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,552
Brookings or that they might be

839
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,344
No we don't have enough conference rooms

840
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,648
But when you actually look at how they're used

841
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,976
They may have to use 25 or 30% of the time

842
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,536
So you have to have a tool to give the feedback

843
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,352
It says he opens up let someone else use

844
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:23,264
Example of what you can do when you're actually have the day off but I'll tell you over all looking at

845
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,336
Hundreds of thousands of square feet of

846
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
Space now that we look at

847
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:33,760
I've never seen a floor or a space that didn't have at least

848
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:38,112
20% opportunity for improvement in efficiency in those areas

849
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:42,464
Or you just have a ton of wasted space and even places where people

850
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,744
Stop the company said

851
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,816
I thought this was a pretty good shape but when I see the data

852
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
I realize that

853
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,704
We'll have to see I'm I'm curious Lake

854
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:58,080
You don't have in common areas or even just having kind of a vacant area where you can like

855
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,408
Momentarily go to rest in the value there

856
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,712
I have no idea what we'll have to see

857
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,064
Cuz your point is

858
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,624
Really interesting cuz there's another group

859
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,672
Maybe a different approach

860
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,512
People who tried to reinvent the workspace

861
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
Just as you described

862
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,328
Where you have

863
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:23,936
It's been having your cure your office in the strict area that you're supposed to be working in

864
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:29,312
Mix it up a bit more common areas for working anywhere open areas in public areas for

865
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:34,176
I'll make a little bit more relaxed environment you can collaborate

866
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
Etcetera

867
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:40,320
The interesting thing is that the people that are trying to build those kinds of work space

868
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,112
Love to stay tattoo

869
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,672
Because it tells of the kids some feedback

870
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,208
Is it really work

871
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,536
What is the culture change were trying to effect actually

872
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:50,816
Doing anything

873
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:56,704
Exactly and I won't need the name of the company but we had a recent experience where

874
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,496
One of the people here just

875
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,776
Implemented

876
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,080
What are these new workspaces in the building

877
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,920
Running into the building

878
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,712
Can I see it though

879
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,736
Show them the data

880
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,552
And he looks at it and literally in 6

881
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
60 seconds he went

882
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
It's not working

883
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:20,512
You said it's not working I can tell looking at the flow in the traffic patterns and what's happening here this is not what we intended

884
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:24,096
And the question is is it because we didn't educate people

885
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:30,240
We didn't tell them you know how it was to be utilizing what the opportunities were or is it just designed Willie and so

886
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:35,104
She got real time data for the first time that we instead of anecdotal or subjective

887
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,944
She could look at it and instantly see it wasn't what they could plan

888
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,272
Wow bummer for him and

889
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,320
What a cool opportunity to be like

890
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,112
Hey now we can try

891
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,184
And this is this is kind of the cool thing about the Internet of Things

892
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:54,560
And if it works for everything is when you have real-time data you can Implement changes

893
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,120
And see if they're working like

894
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,680
Instantly and you don't have to wait

895
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
You know

896
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:06,592
4 weeks or months you can actually make small changes and iterate very quickly

897
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,920
And things is largest you know changing your company's culture

898
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,968
Which I think is really

899
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,992
Really powerful

900
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,832
It strikes

901
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:21,184
People I think intuitively think the Internet of Things is a big deal and it is

902
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,792
We just have to find those applications and places where it is at the theaters

903
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,352
Just what you described as what people found

904
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,168
When people went to internet via level of marketing

905
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,960
Websites you could change

906
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,496
How you approach to the cast

907
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,152
Tons of experiments

908
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,712
The same things possible with the internet

909
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,248
More Realty

910
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,528
Experimentation

911
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,064
Truly database with quick

912
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,624
Turn around bright eyes a b testing in the real world

913
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
And be like okay guy

914
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:58,560
Change something this weekend he do make a great catch a case study for you later on

915
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
Okay

916
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,864
So let's talk

917
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
About

918
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
You guys and

919
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,496
You did something very cool probably

920
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:10,080
I'm guessing about two years ago now when you came into the company

921
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,360
Because

922
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,152
Your product is not cheap

923
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,736
And you had a really tough time

924
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
Selling it

925
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,856
Two companies not because they didn't see the value in what you were doing but because it

926
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,672
It's expensive to retrofit your buildings and

927
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,696
As you put it

928
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,232
Facilities management

929
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,048
That is not a budget line item that gets a lot of love

930
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,912
I think you put it a little bit more

931
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,704
A little differently but we won't do that because

932
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,128
Facilities Management so you guys built a really cool product

933
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,968
I say it's really cool because I'm a finance keep but I'd love for you to talk about

934
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
What you guys do

935
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:54,112
No you hit it on the head I got when I got to the company you see this

936
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
You put in the SEC

937
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,488
Energy transfer itself

938
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,512
And so then

939
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,888
Turn off the shelves was the first clue

940
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
Is an ass

941
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:12,800
Buildings done....

942
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,408
And it's right there the problem

943
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:20,992
It was a hundred companies which for a young company with a lot of company

944
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,528
One building

945
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:27,392
There's one company with a hundred buildings and 19 between 2 and 8

946
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:33,280
And so clearly we weren't moving from one to two to three buildings quickly

947
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,864
Problem do people not like it is their nose or some tissue

948
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
Not at all the issue

949
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,936
If it was just what you said

950
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
It was the capital Lobster

951
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,032
Every single building

952
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,824
Costas decided as you said

953
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,784
A couple of dollars a square foot to do this kind of

954
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,600
And the Capital Equipment

955
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,416
Approval or priority inside companies

956
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:05,792
Facilities as pretty much at the bottom of the barrel they don't get a lot of love I think it's a great description

957
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,352
How do you solve that problem

958
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,680
Will they want someone company which was AT&T

959
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,288
And that's where the problems have been solved

960
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,360
At least the seeds of the problem had been solved

961
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:25,504
They are we did something that we now call the go model for financing or it's really a business model

962
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
AT&T

963
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,832
What's exactly is Experian

964
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,392
Solder technology thought it was wonderful

965
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
Went to go get it done

966
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:39,072
And realize in the process o my God I will be retired by the time I get 20 buildings. It's just going to be

967
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
Arduous

968
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,168
Crazy process to get approval building by building

969
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
And the issue is

970
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:50,080
We got to get over that hurdle and so that person at AT&T

971
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,128
In a couple of people at

972
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,175
Ablation invented this year model

973
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,479
Adagio model in its ultimate

974
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,783
The simplest way maybe to describe it

975
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,343
It's like SolarCity for company

976
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:05,439
Yeoman SolarCity going to come to your house or any of its brethren

977
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,487
SolarCity comes to your house

978
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,535
You don't have to cough up a single penny

979
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,863
It'll take out gather alone without any money

980
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:17,983
They come there they designed they install the solar panel system

981
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,519
And all you have to do is

982
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,431
And that's what I go model is for corporations

983
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,479
Around the energy Savings in lighting

984
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,271
So we come into the company

985
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:36,415
We say hey look we're going to all of that

986
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,975
Impinge your balance sheet 1iota

987
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:45,375
And you start getting the Energy savings right away and share at the beginning to get party Energy savings of course

988
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,191
Your tire price of God

989
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,007
Of the design installation and maintenance of this

990
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,287
Yeah censor net worth

991
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:57,919
At the end of the term of the contract issues anywhere between three and the longest we've ever done is 10 years

992
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,271
The customer gets all the savings and so this is a capital freeway

993
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:08,159
How people get all they sensor networks installed and have their entire portfolio real estate

994
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
Become

995
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
Smart building

996
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,231
3D sensor Network

997
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,279
Paid for by the Energy savings

998
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
Finance

999
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:18,399
To our vehicle legal range for the financing just like SolarCity

1000
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:23,007
And how many other customers have you added since been doing

1001
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:27,615
So we have a starting at the end of the last year

1002
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,919
So at the end of 2014

1003
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
Change the focus of the company

1004
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,783
Hayirli to focus a direct sales on Justice

1005
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
Geocel

1006
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:39,903
Portfolio selling

1007
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,951
Not interested

1008
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,255
Still it's not the right match with what we're doing

1009
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:48,351
AT&T at the end of last year we batted so far this year six

1010
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,887
New jio customer

1011
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,935
Gone for the portfolio wide

1012
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
Approach

1013
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:57,055
An interesting discussion today about errands

1014
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
Space

1015
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,639
Is that when you go in and you talk

1016
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,711
First of all those decisions have to be made at a sea level

1017
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
It's released

1018
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,319
The CFO the CEO of the clo

1019
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,111
Administrative officer

1020
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,183
Potentially sometimes the general manager is someone at that level

1021
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,463
Who's looking at coffee

1022
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Tire Company

1023
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,535
Tire real estate portfolio

1024
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,327
And that person typically

1025
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,887
Excited is one of the application

1026
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:26,751
You're so most recently I was with the CFO of Fortune 20 company

1027
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,799
What are the largest companies in America

1028
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,335
In the Sea of Love lyrics

1029
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,895
Instantly got the whole Space

1030
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
Application

1031
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:39,551
They have 35 million square feet of space and their real estate portfolio

1032
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,831
Lisa Frank

1033
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,671
Untended Garden we just don't have a handle on it

1034
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,951
It's been very much

1035
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,279
Partition done building by Building Group by Group by area

1036
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,327
And we've got to get our arms around that

1037
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:57,727
And we need the data I want that data on every single building so I have an ability to manage everything I want all night

1038
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
Feliz marte's

1039
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,031
And the beauty is

1040
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,311
There's no way

1041
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:05,151
I would work out in his case until 7

1042
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:09,503
In order to do the SMART building upgrades you know to make that happen but he goes with your GF

1043
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:17,439
The energy saving space for it and I get my smart buildings that I get that space application so I can actually manage my realist

1044
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,231
Facebook data for the first time

1046
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:21,791
Miralax

1047
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,815
Food for thought

1048
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,583
About

1049
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607

1051
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,215
Occupation data-driven real estate

00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,519
And of course energy-savings

1053
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
