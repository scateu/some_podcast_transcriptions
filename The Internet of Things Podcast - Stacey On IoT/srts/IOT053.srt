00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,032
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,568
Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,592
Cohoes

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,944
And today we have amazingly huge news

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,248
We've got reviews of the Amazon.

7
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:25,088
And some Integrations that

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,928
We start a review of the osram lightify switch

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,256
The big news of the week which is

10
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,328
Nest shutting down the revolv smart

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
Hub

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
Later

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,656
Actually it's Nick

14
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,936
What's my next turn

15
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,704
Next month

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,240
Because Kevin

17
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,520
Works for Google

18
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:49,152
Annies nest

19
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:54,016
We're just going to call

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,088
Google back in 2014 when they bought

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,112
Revolve

22
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,136
And so

23
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,184
What's happening there is

24
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,488
Let me just clarify actually

25
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:08,096
Alphabet bought Nest but Nest itself but revolve correct

26
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,424
And I only said it because it's kind of like a separate

27
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,472
I think there was told her to be

28
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,520
Beaver Run autonomously

29
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,152
Yes although what we found a couple weeks ago in the story from the information is that

30
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,456
When next fight dropped

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,600
That was actually a bill that was brought to them by the Google

32
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,624
Corporate development team

33
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,160
Which

34
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
You're like

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
Beaver Falls steel happened

36
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,280
In October

37
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,072
Which is several months late

38
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,864
9 months after the deal closed

39
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
And that's almost

40
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
2014 A7

41
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,240
Yes. Ness pot revolve

42
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,776
Gotcha

43
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
So

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,616
And actually at that time I thought they said

45
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,920
That they were no longer going to sell the hardware

46
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:58,528
So what they said at the time I went back and looked at my stories cuz

47
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
Remember you cover it

48
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
Yeah well okay

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
We said what

50
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
No I guess not

51
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:11,840
People have evolved devices the service will no longer be available as of May 5th

52
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,424
Revolve app won't open in the hub won't work that's

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,728
I'm reading that verbatim from the revolve block right now

54
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,800
So that's what happened there is a tizzy

55
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592
And a very

56
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
Legitimate sense

57
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,456
Totally understandable sense of frustration from users

58
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,992
To purchase the revolve

59
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,088
Which I thought had lifetime service guarantee number one

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,464
And it did have a one year warranty but since has been sold in a year I guess that's all at the window

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
Well

62
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
Yes so what happened was

63
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:48,192
It was $299 for this Hub and at the time it was going up against things like SmartThings which cost about

64
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
Important notice

65
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
When it was sold

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
They said

67
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,104
Rapala / nest

68
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,152
They said they wouldn't update the product

69
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:02,016
They also said they wouldn't Provide support after a year and they also said

70
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,576
Because of a 1-year warranty at the time

71
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,368
You and I on our podcast

72
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,488
Prior to this one said that you know that probably meant you shouldn't buy a revolve anytime soon because

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,304
It was not going to be updated or kept up

74
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
No time

75
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
Did they say

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,448
Hey

77
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,288
Yeah that's essentially what's happening is the back-end services

78
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,592
Are shutting down leaving these

79
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
Hardware

80
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,408
Deaths that people paid to 99 Ford

81
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
Arundel

82
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
Useless because

83
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,760
It's tied to that service

84
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
And

85
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
Again I'm going to read from

86
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
The site

87
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,976
We're pouring all her energy into works with nest and Incredibly excited by what we're making

88
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:48,608
Unfortunately that means we can't allocate resources to revolve anymore and we have to shut down the service

89
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,704
People basically a hardware that's just no longer going to work there's no

90
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,520
There's no alternative service don't get into

91
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
Nothing has been said about

92
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,360
Do you think Services being open source or anything like that

93
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
So

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,968
If you have one of these it literally will not work after May 15th

95
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,528
So consumers

96
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,600
Correct that means

97
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,416
When you bought the platform back in 2014

98
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,232
Or late 2013

99
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
Because it did exist then

100
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
You were probably like

101
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
Crap I just spent

102
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,911
You know $300 on something and it lasted me for you know

103
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Not even

104
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,591
And I can understand me so I can understand people's frustration with the news in the development here but I can also understand why people

105
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,407
Chose revolve back that even though it was more expensive

106
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
Is if I remember correctly

107
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,271
Wasn't that the how the heck pretty much every single radio

108
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:43,391
It had every single radio and when I did I did a comprehensive review of smart home hubs

109
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
Christmas of 2013

110
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,487
Was actually one of my favorites

111
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,559
It had good software it had great pairing

112
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
It it was a really

113
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Good product

114
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
Don't know how well it sold

115
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
It was only on the market for a limited time

116
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,751
Was expensive

117
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
And so when Nest bought them

118
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
It was kind of like

119
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
That's a bunch of good Engineers from Boulder Colorado

120
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
Bricks for the base ship

121
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
So I don't know how many people are upset

122
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,319
My hunch is that it's

123
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
Probably not as many but

124
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
It does bring up

125
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,927
Really important issues for the in

126
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:23,071
We talked about a lot so it's so funny I mean I hate to have bad news

127
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,167
Reflect back on the themes that we've been harping on for the past month or two but

128
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,983
We haven't talked about this we talked many times about

129
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,567
Cloud vs local when it comes to Smart Homes and IRT

130
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,871
We talked about holding devices hostage

131
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Instalok

132
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,431
It's a shame that something

133
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,295
Tangible had to happen to resurface these discussions but they have to be resurfaced because

134
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,343
There are still challenges that have to be

135
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Resolved

136
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,207
It was a big economic challenge actually we don't talk about

137
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
And I

138
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
We probably should

139
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
On the side of the nest folks

140
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
Supporting

141
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,167
Project with limited users

142
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,263
That is not making additional Revenue when you still have to

143
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,407
Buy server infrastructure in dilute and engineer or possibly to I don't know how messy it is on the back end

144
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
To it

145
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,735
Is expensive and

146
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,039
It doesn't really justify the cost over

147
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,879
The potential life cycle of the device in that gets into that disconnect between

148
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:24,767
Installing something in your house and expecting it to last for 10 years and being a business whose like

149
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
Oh crap I'm not going to want to search

150
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
Forever oh my God what did I do

151
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,703
Yeah because it becomes a numbers game what's the bottom line

152
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,775
That's that's frustrating for

153
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,591
Consumers for you know any of these products because

154
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:44,479
It now reaches the questions of you know what other services may go away to render things

155
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,807
Useless you know I mean this could apply to cars this

156
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
Reply to

157
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,623
Tea party Lee everything is connected

158
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,511
So there was a wonderful recode story talk about Nest only pulling in 340 million of Revenue

159
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,327
And not meeting its like 500 million dollar a year

160
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
Targets

161
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,399
I really don't think the

162
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
You don't nest

163
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
Google would let Nest become little

164
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
Warts on your wall right

165
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
You know it's true

166
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,919
If you Woulda thought that's what happened to revolve either right now

167
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
This is exactly why

168
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,855
And I do I have a lot of doubts about companies

169
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:26,463
And they're their thought process around this very few companies I talked to have things like

170
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,535
Oh we got an escrow account for our software

171
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,583
In case we got a business or

172
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
AR

173
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
Some sort of money to

174
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
To keep operating our cloud

175
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
If something happens

176
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
I love that I wish I wish

177
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
Everybody in this industry

178
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
Took that approach but

179
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,103
Obviously not everybody does

180
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,967
I'll be quite honest I've said many times how much I love the wink hub

181
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
When you were reporting that Flex

182
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
Butt wink and wink with Sinnoh

183
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,623
Digesting of working everything else I was concerned

184
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,695
Don't my whole platform for my house is that going away will it

185
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Will it shut down

186
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,791
Is it gets frustrating peppermint industry perspective

187
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,119
Right in this is one of the reasons why consumers are like

188
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,167
They're going to look at this and they're going to like

189
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,215
Oh shoot dance that bullet

190
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
Screw this Marco

191
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
That hurts consumer sentiment as a whole

192
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
Which will hold up the industry

193
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
So my hope is we get

194
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,687
Some form of

195
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
Industry-standard and maybe it's

196
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,551
Maybe it's like security like as a member of the media

197
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,463
And we should be talking to our guests like Hey how do you plan to support your stuff if you got a business just like we started we started asking about

198
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
About security for the

199
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
Yeah

200
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
It maybe should be a you know what

201
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
Another must ask question on the list now

202
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
And then

203
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,447
The flip side is too mean I'm actually like

204
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:45,567
To the point where I'm well gee maybe I need to go back to a completely local Bass Run on server kind of thing

205
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
You know I mean it

206
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
Assassin

207
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,223
What to talk about building your own smart home hub

208
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Raspberry Pi

209
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
When you can be done

210
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
Raspberry Pi openhab

211
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
Openhab

212
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
So that's the nest

213
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
Revolve

214
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Drama

215
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
In a nutshell

216
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
I really like that

217
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:11,167
And our take on it is things like escrow accounts open source software or rather just put in your software in there if you

218
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
I want to make it open source

219
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
In case something bad happens

220
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,079
Negotiations you know when you're negotiating a deal like an m&a deal

221
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Baby you make some sort of

222
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
Users

223
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
So

224
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
I would love to see that

225
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,807
Cuz I mean the value of these companies

226
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
It's not actually clear yet what it is

227
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,927
Is it the data is at the user base and

228
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
That

229
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,047
It all starts with a user's because you don't get dead without users number one and

230
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
If you don't have a product

231
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
2

232
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
Offer to people that they want him in

233
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
You're not going to have users to me it's all about users

234
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,311
Well in that spot revolves though they said it was more about the engineering

235
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Date fruit

236
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
So that was kind of an apple higher

237
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,455
So I guess truth the writing was on the wall

238
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
Possibly.

239
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,063
Actually kind of us cuz they did say they were going to

240
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,391
Add new features and supported after a year so

241
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
Yes they didn't say they were going to turn it off

242
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:15,679
Let's move onto a week ago will actually last Thursday so a week from when you guys are hearing this

243
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
Kevin and I both

244
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,543
Received

245
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
It's actually

246
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
Did you got it on Wednesday

247
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
I did

248
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
I'm not that that matters to anybody who's listening

249
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
Yes I got mine before you did

250
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,367
I'm going to talk about

251
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
Amazon

252
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Okay

253
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Smaller version

254
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
Of the two new products that

255
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Amazon

256
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
Put it out and it's

257
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:47,679
The echo lineup what's actually figure out what the heck we're going to call the Amazon Echo.

258
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,263
In tap what are those see that's the thing that there's the Amazon Echo

259
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
Then there's the

260
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
Amazon.

261
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
And then there's the

262
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Echo tap I believe

263
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
I thought so

264
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
I'm checking as we speak

265
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,903
Summit I remember the standing out like all of these there's no consistency in

266
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
What is were

267
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,279
Amazon Echo

268
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
The Amazon Echo obviously

269
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,631
The Amazon tap and the Amazon.

270
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,447
So only the echo is the echo

271
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Right

272
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,543
Question in our challenge here is

273
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,359
What the heck are we going to call these products because

274
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:32,735
There's a word for the more than the Amazon Echo we have to save the Amazon

275
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
Something's

276
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
The connected speaker line that's not really it

277
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Bear

278
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,695
Voice assistant voice assistant

279
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
Listeners

280
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
Let us know if you have a great idea or if you've heard the actual term

281
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
Cuz

282
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Kevin and I cannot read it

283
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
Alright so

284
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
Back-to-the.

285
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
We both elected for.

286
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
What we talked about why we had a reader talk to us about their privacy

287
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
That's why they got the tap

288
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
That's because you are

289
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
Tap it on to listen and then tap it back off

290
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,503
Where isthe. Is always listening and has a

291
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Smaller speaker

292
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
So Kevin

293
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
19 hours

294
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
What did you think

295
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
I think

296
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
I love it I mean I'll I'll be blunt I love it

297
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,303
It's it's everything the echo is minus the big

298
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Speaker so it literally few

299
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:24,447
Cut the speaker out of an echo and put the two remaining puts together in middle of a hockey puck that's the.

300
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
The speaker that's inside it

301
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,079
I really thought would be like maybe just like a phone speaker

302
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:36,223
It is better than that but marginally better than that and you're still not going to fill a room with

303
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,015
Bass and Rich sound but

304
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,087
Her background music which I often listen to while I'm working all day long

305
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,879
It's actually fine for that

306
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
A little louder than I expected

307
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
And

308
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,815
Payment setup was a breeze if you already have and I could come through the setup process pretty simple using the same

309
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,911
Amazon Alexa app hate to say her name but I had to

310
00:12:55,423 --> 00:13:01,567
I don't know if you noticed this but your skills and my smart home Integrations all came over

311
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,895
I did not to do anything

312
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
McLoud Cafe

313
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
Are there well that's the benefit

314
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
I never said that

315
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,111
Cloud cloud is bad I'm just saying

316
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,463
You know you got a hold of cloud is available and and up and running for you

317
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
Seamless if you already have

318
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,607
Amazon Echo your right everything is transfers over the beautiful thing

319
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
She was literally plug-and-play at that

320
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
Let's figure out

321
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,287
Let's figure out where did you put your

322
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
Dot it where is your Echo

323
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,615
Spell to

324
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
The echo used to be in

325
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,527
My home office where I am now on the second floor and that meant only I would be able to use it because

326
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
I don't have the door shut when I'm working and someone

327
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:50,463
I have moved the echo down to the family room so it sits between the family room in the kitchen so that everybody can use it

328
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,023
There was also no way to control Smart Home Stuff

329
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
I'm downstairs now there is for everybody

330
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,935
So now that God is taking the place in my home office sitting behind me and I had to connected

331
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
Temporarily to a

332
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
Jawbone

333
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,359
Big Jambox because my Marshall stanmore speaker is broken which I didn't know until I

334
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
Connected

335
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
Okay

336
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,039
Did you name them both I have to say it you guys

337
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
Did you name them both

338
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,927
Yes I did you don't get any new choices to get the same 3 choices

339
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,999
I kind of thought maybe you could call it. But I thought so too

340
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
Yeah no no.

341
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:30,143
No. And if I'm in the middle of the two of them like I'm on the stairs

342
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,447
Between the first and second floor and I shout out her name

343
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,239
She responds on both of them and

344
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,055
Hopefully one or both ears me and they both respond

345
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,615
They work independently I want to be clear

346
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
You can't multitask

347
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
Music through the

348
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,967
Yet

349
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:49,599
It's a cheap way to add the echo this is what I love about it's an inexpensive way to add it

350
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
To all

351
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,671
That's what that mean if you've got it so

352
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
We didn't actually specify this but

353
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
It comes with a line in

354
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Jack in

355
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,351
7.5 mm cord in jackass

356
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Puppet in

357
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
I called line in cuz that's the

358
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,495
Commander my sodas

359
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,823
Stand alone till you don't need to connect to a speaker

360
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
You do not

361
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,151
I can buy what it is

362
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
What is great

363
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:19,807
I also connected it to my receiver which is in my AV system which is where I thought I was going to end up putting it

364
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
Oh my God it sounded

365
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Like

366
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
Just fabulous

367
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
I was like what

368
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,999
But we realize that

369
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Because that's

370
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
Sarhul

371
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
Home entertainment system

372
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:36,703
That it's hard when it cuz then it's right by the TV and then if we're watching TV we can't shout it

373
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:41,055
You don't go to church or the. To turn off the television so we ended up

374
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Keeping

375
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,919
Original Echo downstairs to the kitchen where it was

376
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:50,527
After a couple days and then we move the. Upstairs

377
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
Bedroom and it's actually

378
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
My husband

379
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,135
Throughout his alarm clock and made it his alarm

380
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,951
Sports crate for that absolutely

381
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,791
Now it's funny you mention the TV because as soon as I got this

382
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,375
All we can figure and put the echo downstairs by the TV

383
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,447
I have an Amazon Fire TV connect is that TV

384
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:14,591
And I'm like okay I can use the voice remote for that and I can control the TV you know the playback of Amazon stuff

385
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
Wouldn't it be nice if I could just

386
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
Use the echo to do that

387
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,247
Unfortunate you can't spend mix there's no way that I know of yet

388
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,319
So that is unfortunate now I will say

389
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
Here's where we get to some

390
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Integration

391
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
You guys are gonna

392
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Or not

393
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
So

394
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
3 things to know

395
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
It integration

396
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
1

397
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,655
Amazon is integrating with

398
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Lutron

399
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
My favorite light switches

400
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
Time interest

401
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
Because I forgot to tell you the show

402
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,895
Michael pecina the CEO of Lutron is actually Our Guest so stay tuned for him

403
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
And

404
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
2

405
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:56,319
Comedy clubs you know me that we talked about before also did it integration with nest

406
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,135
Like you said and then three

407
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
Amazon on Tuesday this week

408
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Announced

409
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,255
That they're smart home skill API

410
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
Is now available

411
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,119
Everyone they launched it originally as the Alexa lighting API

412
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Sorry I said

413
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,703
In August 2015

414
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,263
So all the companies that offer

415
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,847
Like lighting support like SmartThings Philips Hue Etc

416
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,127
They were all working

417
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Through

418
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
That API but now it's

419
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
Available to everyone

420
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:29,599
Yay yay so now if you got to connect to thermostat connected lights of any sort you can actually make it

421
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
Tourettes with

422
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,207
The echo so then you can say I'm going to say it again you guys I'm sorry

423
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
Alexa turn on lights as opposed to

424
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
Ask lifx

425
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
To turn on light

426
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
Yeah it's much better with it

427
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,959
Native Integrations because it's a more natural language as opposed to the skill

428
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
Which is a pattern of words

429
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,103
Hope it all make sense

430
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
I have some lights that are

431
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
Controlled

432
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
If this then that trigger

433
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
Russo

434
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,111
And then the rest of my lights are normal so I'm constantly struggling with like

435
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,439
Turn on bedroom

436
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Lights

437
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,767
Yeah

438
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:15,679
Set it for the integration is the various choices we have with if they're saying that different apis sdks and all that

439
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,287
So nice but ultimately made it as ideal because you don't ever think about how to ask it anymore

440
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
You still have to pay

441
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
Think I'm actually running out of

442
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
Words to control

443
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,943
It's more consistent.

444
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:31,039
You don't have to think about cuz I control history if this and that's why I need to ask it this way

445
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
In-N-Out

446
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Yes they're slightly less

447
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
But sometimes I'm just like

448
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
Right

449
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
Whatever works

450
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
We're not there yet

451
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Okay

452
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
But

453
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,959
Okay getting back to the TV

454
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
Because science

455
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
The integration with yonomi

456
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,359
Which is free software that anyone can download on iOS or Android

457
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
And it's much better than

458
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,711
We reviewed it like a year maybe longer ago

459
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,759
And it was a little buggy but cool

460
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
It recognizes

461
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,343
Products like Sonos the Amazon

462
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Nest

463
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Hue Lights

464
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
WeMo

465
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
The Logitech

466
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Harmony

467
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
System hub

468
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,887
A couple other things so there's a lot of connected products on it it's free

469
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,215
They come with like these setups already programmed

470
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
So like

471
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,519
Every time my phone rings

472
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,311
My Sonos is if they're on there

473
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Pause

474
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
Which is

475
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
I think it's awesome

476
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,687
With the Amazon

477
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,527
Devices with the Amazon integration

478
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
Now

479
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,903
You can actually turn on your TV if you have a Logitech Harmony Hub

480
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,719
Because an all you have to do is say

481
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
Hey lady a

482
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
Turn on

483
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
Movie night

484
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,607
Or whatever your

485
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,655
Your routine is

486
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
And you know me

487
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:56,799
So basically now I can control to a limited extent my Sonos has

488
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,591
The echo

489
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,199
I can now set up my TV to turn on

490
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
With

491
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,527
If I have a Logitech Harmony

492
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,087
Do you like so much worse.

493
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
It's okay

494
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
That is cool

495
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,719
That is cool to do this

496
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:19,071
You need to do a couple things or else it will not work and you will be as frustrated as I was

497
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,887
You have to add a device

498
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,679
To you know me you need to

499
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,775
Manually for the next like until they update the app you have to manually like

500
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
Find devices

501
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,383
And once you've done that you have to go back into

502
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Echo

503
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,503
Discover new devices

504
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
Keep your order of operations

505
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
Write the checking for new devices

506
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,415
In the Amazon App should always be the last

507
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,951
I believe the last step

508
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,535
And if you have the Philips Hue Lights you're going to have to go punch a button

509
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
Finally

510
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,119
After that

511
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Immigration

512
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,935
There's also the Lutron integration

513
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,983
Which I was really excited about

514
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
I realize

515
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,919
Cuz I have Lutron lights are connected to the echo through the wing

516
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,455
Link up and I was like

517
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,247
Now I can talk directly to

518
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
You can actually talk to right now.

519
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
So

520
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
Can I get rid of that hug just yet

521
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
Not that we

522
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,424
Link up but but you can still use your Echo to control your Lutron switches now

523
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
Because of the

524
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,752
True

525
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:36,128
If you don't have the wing but you have like the Lutron Bridge which people may have bought for homekit compatibility

526
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
Cuz it was one of the first ones

527
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
We'll talk directly

528
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
So

529
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,552
That's a plus that is a plus

530
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
More lights

531
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
More control

532
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
Speaking of light

533
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Yes

534
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,208
Please tell me if you can talk about this new Switch

535
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,000
I am Because You Loved Me

536
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,400
I love the osram tunable white bulbs that I have in the house I have a couple of them they're all connected and

537
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
Change from

538
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,984
Soft white to warm white tube

539
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Daylight I love my love my love

540
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,056
Banana have a switch

541
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,360
They do so this is the osram

542
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,432
Lightify Wireless dimming Smart Switch

543
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,016
That's a mouthful

544
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,624
Osram lightify switch I guarantee you're going to see this is like a

545
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
Fancier light switch

546
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
It's about $30

547
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
I bought it because

548
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
Someone actually told me about it

549
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584
I was very frustrated by the fact that

550
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
My

551
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,632
Light switch

552
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
Was always

553
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
If it wasn't on a Lutron

554
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,752
Or like a wifi-connected dimmer

555
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,544
People would turn it off

556
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,080
Whatever people turn it off

557
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,616
Get out then my

558
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
Connect to light bulbs didn't work

559
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
And that was always kind of

560
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Frustrating

561
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
So

562
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,832
I got this thinking I could put it anywhere and it would

563
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,368
The way it looks

564
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,672
It looks like it actually toggles

565
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:59,072
Your switch cuz it comes with different backing plates that you put on top of the existing switch so you don't have to mess around with electricity

566
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
Okay that's the other reason I got

567
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,912
That's cuz I know people are kind of worried about that

568
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,752
I was like Hey would it be awesome if I could tell them about this connect a light switch that

569
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
Still toggles there

570
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Switch physically

571
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,872
And keeps track of state which is what I thought it did but it does not do

572
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,992
I know it almost looks like so it fits over existing switch

573
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
It does

574
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,856
Basically just talks to your existing osram lightify lights

575
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
So you press it up and down

576
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:28,000
It doesn't control your physical switch so your physical switch will always stay on

577
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,816
He put it over the switch and then that switch

578
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,864
Now talk to your eyes room lights

579
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,912
And you don't turns off and on

580
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
It is

581
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Zigbee compatible

582
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,544
I hooked it up to the wink

583
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:46,944
And it didn't quite work the way I thought but I think I need to hook it up as a remote instead of as an actual switch

584
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,760
So I'm still getting this

585
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,832
I'm still trying to find the use case for it cuz I was

586
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
Again

587
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136
I thought it would like

588
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,928
Well do something different

589
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,744
So I mean it dims your bulbs

590
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,584
Yeah that you can you can already do that through an echo or hug or whatever

591
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,656
But this also gives you the physical option now of giving

592
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,472
Write so someone goes and hits that switch

593
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,056
They're used to just hit the switch on the wall they're still going to be able to hit the switch on the wall

594
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,336
End

595
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,408
The nice thing about it is if it pairs to your lights

596
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,016
Your underlying physical switch will always be on

597
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,320
When someone actually touches

598
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,136
The switch which is on top of the physical switch

599
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:35,072
And I would imagine that it didn't give the state of the light bulb

600
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,632
To any apps or any like that as well

601
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,168
Exactly

602
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:44,544
And you don't even have to put this over an existing switch like I see a picture of it on Amazon music. On a nightstand just

603
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,360
So it comes with three different bag

604
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,176
And one is for the

605
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,224
Traditional toggle switches with a little

606
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
Toggle sticking out of the switch

607
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
One is for the

608
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
Flatter switches

609
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
Rockers

610
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,184
Chips or rocker switch

611
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
And then the other

612
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:07,072
So many reason were here is a plain back

613
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,376
And I'ma put this on the wrong light

614
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,400
1st and

615
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,448
If it took me like 5 Seconds

616
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
Ghetto unscrew the

617
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,592
Screws holding my existing light switch plate in place and

618
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
Can I screw this guy in and

619
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
That was it

620
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,736
It's really easy it was easy to pair

621
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,296
So if you need something like this

622
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
It's 30 bucks

623
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,648
It does stick out from the wall my husband told me that I could not leave it up

624
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,512
Yeah it looks like it sticks out a good 1/2 inch or 3/4 of an inch from a

625
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Wall

626
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:43,680
Yeah it's pretty ish it does have it right on the switch

627
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,960
Yeah

628
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Sure

629
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
Sure but it does

630
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
It tells you this

631
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,592
The top is at the bottom

632
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,432
Well in the any other thing I like about this I mean

633
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,992
I don't think it's for me because I connect

634
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,576
You know your eyebrows are involves going through the way again the echo.and

635
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,112
Stuck at the apps I got the voice

636
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:07,232
Interactional s but my family still isn't into the whole shouting at something to turn lights on

637
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
So I could see

638
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,632
Them using this is proper some reason why use a phone app or

639
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:17,472
Or doesn't have a voice activation system for these things

640
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
Yeah cuz it needs a physical product

641
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
Or yes

642
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,896
Or it's good for if you have a light switch in An Inconvenient spot

643
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,968
And you can put an osram bulb in

644
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,552
Do you hook up a parrot to this guy

645
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
And then boom

646
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,880
You now have a light switch wherever you want it

647
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:35,904
Yeah

648
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,232
Wireless light switch kit

649
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
Okay so that's what this is

650
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,560
It does work is easy pair

651
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
And

652
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
30 bucks is 30 bucks

653
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
It's available on

654
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
Amazon in

655
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,312
Okay so we talked about quite a bit I think that's probably good for us

656
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,104
Before I leave

657
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128

Great stops so far

662
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,440
Yeah it's a little late if it takes you a minute it's

663
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,488
It's taking too long it's there's not that much there.

664
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
It's very fast

665
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,816

Secrets to Smart Lighting in your house

670
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,152
Did you know Kevin that we are all using

671
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
Way too much light

672
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,736
I'm not surprised by that he's an awful lot of like

673
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,088
It's it's not a scarce resource but you're not letting your home correctly

674
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
Stay tuned

675
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:45,536

Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast

681
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:23,168
This is your hope Stacey Higginbotham and today my guess is Michael piscina Who is the co-ceo

682
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,960
And president of Lutron

683
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,496
Hi Michael how are you doing

684
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,336
Hi Stacy I'm doing great how are you

685
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,176
I am really excited to have you on the show because I have

686
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,016
Probably five or six Lutron switches throughout my house and

687
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
I love them

688
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,600
And I'm kind of very curious to find out

689
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,904
The future of these things that I have

690
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
Put in my home so

691
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
Let's talk about

692
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,048
What she looks first tell the audience

693
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
What Lutron is

694
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,728
Thank you Stacey and again thank you for giving us the opportunity to tell her to tell her story on your show

695
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,288
Somatron we have been

696
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,336
55 years in the lighting

697
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,104
Pro-business

698
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,664
Back to Genesis of our company is our founder

699
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,736
Under The Lights dimmer in 1961

700
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,760
Products

701
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:16,416
Serve the both commercial and residential markets and Factor about 50% residential and 50% commercial

702
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,000
So since you got a pretty long perspective here is a company

703
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,680
What has changed in the last let's call it for 5 years with relation to kind of the Smart Home

704
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,008
The launch of all these hubs and kind of the snoo

705
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,288
Exciting

706
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,312
Is it just

707
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
Going down Market

708
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,408
For the smart home or is there something different happening

709
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,528
I think there's significant things and I thought maybe maybe Stacy would be

710
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,880
Alfred schedule is just a very very and I'll just take a few minutes if I could

711
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,672
Timeline about Lutron

712
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,000
But I mention 1961 or founder patented

713
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,864
And that was an obviously the input that was the start of the company

714
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
Important

715
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:01,984
You asked about 5 years ago what's different and really what happened in two

716
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,288
7 2008 with a smartphone

717
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,360
Smartphone and everybody's hands today

718
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,664
Now all the sudden gave you the ability

719
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,968
Two notches control items

720
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,992
In your home

721
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,088
Your home from outside of your home

722
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
And the development of apps

723
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:23,232
With our reliable lighting control technology was just a natural

724
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,024
Putting these things together

725
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
Such that

726
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,096
Again you have the control in your home

727
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:33,216
Or if you want to set scenes or have geofencing or any kind of capabilities of

728
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:39,360
When you're approaching your home have your lights turn on automatically to welcome same so you never enter a dark home

729
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:43,456
That was a natural I think that's been the big change I don't think it's as much

730
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:49,600
Downmarket although we've developed technology for the mass-market the wireless technology

731
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:54,720
It's really been that the smart all-sec smartphones and tablets have made I really made the

732
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
Connected home

733
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:56,768
Potential

734
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,328
Much more of the mass Market product

735
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,656
Okay and that dope because

736
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:06,240
Agree with you the smartphone is really opened up a lot of things

737
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,544
What I have seen

738
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
In the next

739
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,896
Will say in the next few years what seems to be coming

740
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:19,552
Technology that works directly with the smartphone

741
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,856
There's a Wi-Fi light bulbs out there

742
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,416
Lutron has this amazing

743
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,976
Proprietary radio technology

744
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,024
But I'm very curious

745
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,328
How you see the future

746
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,400
Of kinds of wireless tech and

747
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:40,288
It's supporting that across many platforms and making it kind of interoperable with some of the other Gadgets in the smart

748
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,920
I think space you're exactly right we we employ our Wireless Clear connect technology

749
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,712
And it's all about reliability

750
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:51,040
It's all about when the button presses occurred

751
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,088
That you want to turn a light on

752
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,392
Not only does it always turn on

753
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,208
But it turns on fast we called Liam

754
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,744
But I think

755
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
When you look at Bluetooth

756
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,376
Where you look at Wi-Fi are you look at other protocols out there and zigbee and Z-Wave

757
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,936
They have a part in this connected home

758
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,264
We'll look at Bluetooth technology and Wi-Fi technology

759
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
For the setup

760
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,360
And that you're very very simple setup of our Tech

761
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,920
Of our lighting control technology

762
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,224
What we have to do is Ensure

763
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
To the homeowner

764
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,272
It's not about

765
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,344
The technology what is Bluetooth Wi-Fi

766
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
Clerk connect

767
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,160
It's about we believe

768
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Precinct

769
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
1

770
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
Does it give the homeowner

771
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
The effect

772
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
That they wanted

773
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,864
Number two

774
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,264
How can we even with different Technologies in Bluetooth and BLS much different than Wi-Fi technology

775
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:47,104
Can you put that behind the curtain so the homeowners G

776
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,128
Just plug it in

777
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,408
And it just works

778
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,456
And the third part of that

779
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
Is the reliability

780
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,808
Will it be reliable over time

781
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,112
We always like to say you don't want to reboot your lighting

782
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,416
But it's true you don't want to

783
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:05,536
Expected

784
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,608
You don't say see one of the things we do is we look at

785
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,656
Okay how how

786
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,728
Close can we get to the reliability of a light switch

787
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,592
Let's take this a little bit further cuz you guys today are launching

788
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,408
An integration with the Amazon Echo

789
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,992
Let's talk about kind of the future

790
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,040
Lutron in this kind of

791
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,112
Interoperable Multi-Device connected home

792
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
Where do you see

793
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,208
That's a great question

794
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
I think one of the things

795
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:40,608
Currently that what we are talking about with Amazon Echo and what we're launching

796
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,912
As we looked at this and we thought

797
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
The Amazon Echo

798
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,544
Really is a very good software platform we've been very pleased with that week

799
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,616
Testing at 4. Of time I know it's getting good response

800
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,152
In the marketplace

801
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,456
And we make great software and Hardware

802
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,784
So we thought it was a natural of bringing Amazon Echo

803
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,856
And the Lutron caseta platform together

804
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,184
So I think one of the things we bring to this

805
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,720
Internet of Things

806
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Is

807
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,560
Making sure things always work

808
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,120
I'm at bringing this back up

809
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,144
Capability

810
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,424
Because again

811
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:21,056
If the internet goes down we want you to always be able to control your lights reliably

812
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
Okay

813
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,152
And let's go platforms because

814
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,456
I think Lutron is now on

815
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,016
Almost all of the big ones so you guys have

816
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,576
Your Bridges homekit certified

817
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,368
You've got the web platform

818
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,648
Look at the Amazon Echo

819
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,208
Do you have anything with the works with Nest program

820
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,768
Yes we are part of the works with Nest program

821
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,328
All right so that's a big for it seems like

822
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
I don't know if there's another big one for you guys

823
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,424
Well we we have worked as

824
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,032
We have work this part of there's been announcements with both AT&T Digital Life

825
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,568
And there's also been announced

826
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
Since with Comcast

827
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,408
Work work as a part of cell

828
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
You know we take

829
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:05,600
You know there are approaches is very simple we believe that we are working and are committed to the

830
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,392
Best lighting control in the world

831
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,536
And we want to make sure it's seamlessly integrate with all the popular platform Stacy

832
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Salt works

833
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,864
And have these protocols

834
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,680
That are outside behind the scenes

835
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,704
Just work

836
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,032
In a fashion that the homeowner doesn't need to worry about

837
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,360
When we say Lutron is going to work with a

838
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,664
In that part of the desk

839
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,968
Platformer work was part of homekit

840
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,504
You just connect it

841
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
And it works

842
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
Head

843
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:40,160
Will do all the hardware and software verification so that that occurs and happens

844
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
And

845
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,744
I think that has been our strategy

846
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:48,352
As well as having our own Bridge capability case somebody just wanted to do lights

847
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,144
Shades and temperature

848
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,704
They have that capability also

849
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,008
And among these platforms

850
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,056
Can you talk to me about

851
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,872
The ease of working with them because they're

852
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,920
There different levels there is

853
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:05,760
Works with Nest is very much developer Focus kind of application thing

854
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:11,648
The echo seems to be more in line with that and then there's home kit which requires Hardware

855
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,440
I'm just kind of curious

856
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,280
As a company that is deciding where to invest their time

857
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,704
How are you evaluating this and what would your advice be to other companies who are looking and trying to decide which platform

858
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
Sport

859
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,544
So that's an excellent question

860
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,640
First of all I think our relationship with all these companies have been very good

861
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
And

862
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:39,552
But there's different levels of integration what we did with link is we embedded are clear connect technology

863
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,648
And that takes a little more time to do that cuz we work out on

864
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
Not just

865
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
Software

866
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:50,816
For also embedding the radio on the antenna design so that has take that took a little more time

867
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,864
What we do with Amazon

868
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,704
And we're doing as part of the nest program doing part of homekit

869
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,008
It's really cloud to Cloud integration

870
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,848
So we were very reliable Cloud platform they have a good Cloud platform

871
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,664
And what we do is work on the software

872
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
So these

873
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,992
Basically cloud-to-cloud Stampley

874
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
We can integrate very

875
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:10,784
Seamlessly

876
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,600
That would be a little bit of an easier approach

877
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,928
Overall all of these companies have been good to work with

878
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,744
Which platform has the most users right now

879
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
Or most of your users

880
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,072
I don't know the answer to

881
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,608
To that question.

882
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,680
Who has the most users

883
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
I can tell you that are

884
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
Zeta platform

885
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,824
Selling our kissaten our Bridge has been very successful

886
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,104
And is continuing

887
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
How to grow

888
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,480
Only the caceda version so these are more the

889
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,784
What has a mass Market switches

890
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,320
A mass Market

891
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,088
PECO

892
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,392
I always want to say pico projectors

893
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,672
The mass Market

894
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,696
Pico remote

895
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:55,072
Those are the only ones that integrate with all these other connected home platform

896
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,656
No the radio raw and homeworks

897
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
We announced it

898
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,960
Acedia last year

899
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,240
Are part of nest

900
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:07,872
They're part of the Honeywell platforms security platforms as well as

901
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,152
Honeywell

902
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,176
Thermostat

903
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
Are those

904
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,016
Part of the Maestro line or is there a different line

905
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,600
So meisterwood brr stand-alone wall box

906
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
Control

907
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,416
But radio radio Rob

908
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,440
Is a wireless

909
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,232
Control system of the 200 points

910
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
Control

911
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,280
At home work switch

912
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
CVS

913
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,864
Level accounts

914
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:29,888
That is

915
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
You can have thousand

916
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,448
Thousands

917
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,264
Control on that and I'll say very customized

918
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,544
Stop program

919
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,616
Yuan Phillip circus Ada and Philips Hue

920
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
How about it 50

921
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
Okay good to know

922
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,480
Because I am

923
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,528
Huge nerd when it comes to lighting

924
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,320
I I tried pretty much everything

925
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:53,696
What are the big trends you guys see in lighting that your kind of follow along with Ben Hur really

926
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
Excited

927
00:38:55,488 --> 00:39:01,632
Well I think one of the things that it's occurred and and and lighting ceremony in the past 3 to 4 years is

928
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:05,216
LED technology-infused if you think of what's going on

929
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:10,592
An LED technology is used the benefit of having a microprocessor and every light bulb

930
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:14,944
It's also added a lot of new people in the marketplace you know in the

931
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,248
And add that what I mean by that

932
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,808
Is your company's today light Cree

933
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,368
And like

934
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,696
Song in and others in the LED Marketplace

935
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,976
Which weren't there

936
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
R56 years ago

937
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:35,424
But the other thing that that's occurring is obviously with a Micro Control in there you can put radios in light bulbs

938
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:38,496
Special put what radios in lightbulbs you'll have the ability to

939
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,520
Call them directly

940
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,312
Commensurately

941
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:44,128
Did the addition of voice technology

942
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,176
What's the Amazon Echo has

943
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,456
Capabilities

944
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,504
And Siri also

945
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,344
Send out we work with those for those platforms so that's something that's

946
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,440
Changes that are occurring we work very hard to stay on top of that

947
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,488
Let's talk about this for a little bit

948
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:04,352
Because I I kind of walked through my house every now and then play a little game with myself about

949
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,656
What's going to be in at 10 years from now

950
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,472
And I'm assuming I'm making a lot of assumptions

951
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,520
Bear with me

952
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:12,800
But

953
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:19,456
I'm trying out some lights right now that I have motion control the cat temperature controls built into kind of ambient light sensor

954
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,528
In some of my rooms

955
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,368
In the hallways and small rooms especially like closets and bath

956
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
X

957
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,440
It's perfect I never touch a light switch

958
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
Like

959
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,488
It's it's awesome

960
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,816
What happened to

961
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,120
I'll use Sonos again cuz it's a good anime

962
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
Creed eyes perhaps

963
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,680
Crate Tech

964
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,960
Work super well

965
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
But

966
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,800
Ask the internet of things kind of happens

967
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,384
It's a very real question about how that will disrupt like

968
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
Your business model so

969
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,968
I might not need my light switches

970
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,832
Well I think it's something you know I've been asked many times Stacy

971
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,856
Talk about disrupt

972
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,928
Disruption actually can be a good thing

973
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:05,792
Spinning around a little bit and don't think about the disruption but look at the opportunity

974
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,096
So what's the opportunity

975
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
And and

976
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,192
Connected light bulbs that have sensing capability

977
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,008
We believe there still a need

978
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
2 in the event

979
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,592
From sensing standpoint

980
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:23,200
You're still going to need the ability if you're standing still and things like that should be able to

981
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:31,136
And and we think they're still opportunities for us to be able to connect to these light bulbs and ways and

982
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,416
Offers Superior

983
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
User

984
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,952
Experience

985
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,048
In a closet application again we could see

986
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
Interfacing with those

987
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,864
Type of applications

988
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:46,240
So maybe you would want to be able to control the lights even before you enter the space

989
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,776
And

990
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,824
You could be able to control them

991
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,360
Maybe by sensors

992
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,640
You ever you approaching

993
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,663
Particular

994
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,991
I can tell you that happens in my hallway today

995
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,551
With our wireless sensor technology

996
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,343
When I get into the hallway

997
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,135
Before I get into the closet

998
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,671
My lights in my closet

999
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,207
Come on to

1000
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:10,303
40 to 50% and then when I get into the closet my lights come on

1001
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
To 90%

1002
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,911
And again there's anticipation

1003
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:21,311
And I think one of the things we remain to be is a very very good very reliable hardware and software

1004
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,847
Technology company

1005
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,711
Are you guys going to be adding it sounded like you were going to be adding some sort of

1006
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:34,367
When you talked about anticipation which I think would be

1007
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,183
Kind of cool because the less I have to program

1008
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
The better

1009
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,303
I'm really not at Liberty Stacy to talk about future developments but

1010
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
Okay

1011
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,399
I have to ask because I'm kind of curious if you get this.

1012
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,727
Everytime I actually was a crazy chain

1013
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,823
I use the Amazon Echo to turn off my dining room light switch

1014
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,895
Stuck on a Lutron switch

1015
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,687
It's the Amazon Echo

1016
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,455
To wink

1017
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
To Lutron

1018
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,295
Do you guys get to see that data

1019
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:08,159
It's going to it's going through so many places so I'm curious

1020
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,999
The day that we would see as we know the

1021
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:16,351
Product is being hooked up we don't know the specifics of that

1022
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,143
On how it is

1023
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,983
Working in and we don't know the specifics in terms of users

1024
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,311
And how the users are using the product that's

1025
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,103
Obviously information and

1026
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,151
That we would not interfere

1027
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,943
4 or 1/2

1028
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:36,319
The intruding in people's lives but I think one of the things we do is we'll hook up

1029
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:40,159
The Amazon Echo in our technology and we'll look how people are used

1030
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,719
Dance day in and day out

1031
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,023
And then final advice

1032
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,327
I would love to pick your brain since you are

1033
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,119
Become CEO of a lighting

1034
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,935
Give us some advice on

1035
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,959
Lighting settings

1036
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,495
Because as people are

1037
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,335
Transitioning to LEDs that have this level of customization

1038
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,639
Let's just run through some basic

1039
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
Scenarios

1040
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,991
Give them to you and then you tell me you kind of

1041
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,807
Where should my lighting be maybe it's a temperature may be a

1042
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,087
Adapt

1043
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,623
Are you ready for this do you think

1044
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,391
Do this

1045
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,207
I can try for my experience

1046
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
Okay

1047
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
Movie night

1048
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,863
Individual setting could be anywhere between

1049
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,911
Anywhere between camdude

1050
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,983
30% depending on how much light to give available in your room

1051
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,007
Dinner party lighting

1052
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,055
I think it's dinner party lighting

1053
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,591
Is candle lighting

1054
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
Cuz the best

1055
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:38,527
Adelaide in the best lighting is somewhere in the neighborhood again as I'll say any to 10 to 24

1056
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
Okay

1057
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
Good morning

1058
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,951
I think probably one of the greatest things about good morning is having a nice warm light

1059
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:50,559
Probably would let somewhere it's between 30 to 50% and the shades

1060
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,327
Smoking

1061
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
Nice

1062
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
Okay

1063
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,911
Reading before bed

1064
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,775
Reading before bed obviously has to have the the light next to your bed stand

1065
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
Come on to the right level having

1066
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,103
The shades closed

1067
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:07,967
And having the lights around you at a night light level so in the event you had to get up

1068
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,551
You would have the lights at a night light level either of their Wireless.

1069
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,855
Or just on a time clock

1070
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,927
Is there ever a time that we should have 100%

1071
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
Lighting

1072
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,231
Operating room

1073
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,071
I think commercially there are

1074
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
Applications

1075
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:27,679
It also may be a situation where your cleaning up your kitchen

1076
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:32,543
Or cleaning up your your bathroom or or something and you'd want the lights on full

1077
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:36,895
All right guys it sounds like if you don't have some sort of LED light on a dimmer

1078
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,175
You are doing it wrong

1079
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,223
Unless you're just cleaning all the time which

1080
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,783
I really hope for everyone say that is not the case

1081
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,623
You so much for coming on the show today

1082
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:50,975
Stacy thank you for the opportunity and and we look forward to continue

1083
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:57,375
