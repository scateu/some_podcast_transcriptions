00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:01,184
And play it's so much more important now that the iot is everywhere

00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,720
First

23
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,000

Dot-com Stacy check it out and help support our show

37
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,120
So let's get this party started with

38
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
Intel

39
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
Edwin

40
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:20,544
Alright earlier this week and tell said it would spin out Wind River systems

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
2

42
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
PE firm tpg

43
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
Undisclosed

44
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
Price

45
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,832
This is a big deal because Wind River systems in Wind River was in bed

46
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,392
Systems and software

47
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,304
So when I bought it I remember being very like

48
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,888
Wind River for a long time was very

49
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
Independent

50
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:51,520
Because no one seemed to know what it was doing with Intel

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
2016 so

52
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
Autolover 2 years ago

53
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,944
Intel really brought much closer

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,736
CEO of

55
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,552
Winter mobileiron and

56
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
The thought was

57
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,416
Now the Sea. Of time it started like

58
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,464
Shutting down some of its smaller

59
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Turn off low power

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
Energy efficient

61
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
They're not really

62
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
It's low power chips

63
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
It started

64
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
I don't know

65
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Coyote

66
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
And now

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Looks like

68
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
Winter Garden

69
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,592
Actually help Intel sell any iot

70
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
Teechips

71
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,456
And because they're so many embedded OS has

72
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,504
Are tosses for embedded systems

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
And they're free it's

74
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,368
Unclear what river really had to offer

75
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
And it's probably worse even though we don't know the sale price the acquisition price in 2009 was 884

76
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,840
4 million dollars that was a lot of money back then

77
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
So

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,704
Curious how much of that they got back and as far as what

79
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,312
I think I don't know I'm so I'm not going to say a lot or a little but I suspect it was

80
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,872
Not enough because obviously they sold it but

81
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
As you just said Stacey

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
There's so many different

83
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,504
Embedded software platforms out there

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
And there's so many more

85
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,600
Come about since 2009

86
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
When in tell me this acquisition so

87
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,488
I don't know whatever really came out of in a positive way

88
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,583
Introduced Intel to some of the Industrial

89
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
Customers I mean Twin Rivers been around for

90
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
Decades

91
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
It software is inside Manufacturing

92
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
Implants

93
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
All devices

94
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,823
Planes Railways all kinds of places

95
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
So it's not like it's

96
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
It's a nothing

97
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Company it's just true

98
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,247
True it feels very old school in

99
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
I feel like we're getting to this kind of

100
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Newark

101
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,879
Modern modern

102
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:50,047
Yeah so just to your point I mean I shouldn't say nothing came about it because I know that NASA

103
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
Sjpl

104
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
Curiosity Rover Mars

105
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,191
That was powered by wind River

106
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
I did not know that

107
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
Now you know

108
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Who's where

109
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,663
I guess the Rover Market isn't too hot AC

110
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
It's a shame

111
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
Moving from

112
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
I guess

113
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
Embedded systems

114
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Let's talk about

115
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
Spotify this week

116
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Republic

117
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,279
This particular

118
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
Sigmund is not

119
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
Related to it golang

120
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
This is just

121
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
Me complaining about Spotify

122
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
You have special Musical

123
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,287
She's complaining about Spotify

124
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
This is something

125
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,127
Encounter quite a bit in my home

126
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
From various different

127
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
What is this

128
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,247
Spotify has a premium account

129
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Where are you

130
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
There's a count for one person

131
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
And then there's a family premium

132
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
Which is what we have

133
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
And access

134
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,207
For up to 5.

135
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
People can play

136
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Spotify

137
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,583
Which sounds really awesome if you think about it as five people playing

138
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
Crystal Lake phone

139
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
2 something

140
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,447
It is terrible in the world

141
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
Smart speaker

142
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,031
Because all of my Amazon

143
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
And Google

144
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
Speakers are under my account

145
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
And

146
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,431
That means if my daughter is playing Spotify

147
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
In her room

148
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
Amazon

149
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
I can't play it anywhere else in

150
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:20,159
And part of that reason is because she doesn't have an Amazon account because she's not old enough yet to have one

151
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
Legally

152
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,767
She is she can't have it when she's 13 she can have

153
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,399
It's still a little irksome cuz even if I gave my husband

154
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
What room is he in

155
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
He's in the Saint heat cuz he has

156
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
Access his emails

157
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:41,407
I can put his email on certain echos but then they would pull from his calendar and that sort of thinking

158
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
That would be aggravating since

159
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,295
Amazon still doesn't recognize me as an individual in my home

160
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
And yet it recognizes him

161
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
So

162
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,439
The issue here is I would like

163
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
To allocate devices

164
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Not email

165
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
Dresses for my Spotify

166
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Playback

167
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,143
Actually used to do this on Sonos

168
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,727
If you hook your Spotify account up to your Sonos you can play up to

169
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
Two streams on the same Wi-Fi

170
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
Which was

171
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,919
A my house uses Sonos because they have to turn onto an app

172
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967
The Sonos one

173
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Not that fancy

174
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
It's really frustrating

175
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
Spotify

176
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Please make a device

177
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,487
Focused they cannot just use her Focus but make a Multi-Device

178
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
I wonder if

179
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,911
Company service companies are getting away from per device type things because

180
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:40,031
People are buying so many more devices now that are capable of using these services

181
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Maybe

182
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
But

183
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:47,199
I'm not giving them a pass I'm just trying to think this is not the way it used to be

184
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,599
If you have a echo in every room in your house most every room have 5 6 8

185
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
And

186
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
You know I know you

187
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,487
Limit 2 concurrent streams new se5

188
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,023
Concurrent streams are song

189
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
If you do it per device that kind of

190
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,119
Goofy when you have too many

191
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
I don't know

192
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
I knew her voicemail hotline

193
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,239
Question has to do with something

194
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
Disorder related

195
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,383
And this gets to the way things are design in the home now they're designed for

196
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
Individual users

197
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,831
Or there's design for individual users and not for everybody in the home and that's that's something we need to resolve

198
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:29,439
Yes there's definitely a question about identity who gets it who doesn't

199
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
How you allocate

200
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Services

201
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
Yes

202
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Good preview for shadow

203
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Question

204
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
Plea for help from Spotify

205
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,263
And yes I can put an email address for my home

206
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
And then put all my

207
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Home devices

208
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
And honestly if you were going

209
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
I'm trying to say

210
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
Should you set up like

211
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,527
Your home email address for all of your devices

212
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
And then just send it to your

213
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
I guess you could

214
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,415
Some things would not work

215
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
I think your Google calendar is

216
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
I'm going to work unless you also tie it to

217
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Tresor

218
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
Yes

219
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
See

220
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
You just tired

221
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
If you guys have advice

222
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,799
Kevin sent me this email

223
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
About

224
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
The links

225
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
And we started getting into it like

226
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,199
Conversation about what we want in a robot

227
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
This is

228
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,063
This is what we do over the weekend we talk about robots over email

229
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
Where exactly the people

230
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Exact

231
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
So

232
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,375
You know I keep up with what's going on in robotics world because I just want

233
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,423
A robot that does everything for me pretty much

234
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
Interested in the space

235
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,895
And I noticed that there's a new human looking robot

236
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
As $800 it's called The Links

237
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,759
What stood out was that it has

238
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,831
Smart's built into it

239
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,415
Got me thinking

240
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,071
These types of smarts and why are they all trying to recreate the wheel with

241
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,887
Their own personal assistants I saw another nice forever

242
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,447
$1,600 on wheels

243
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,751
House for 8 hours a day

244
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,055
It's got its own personal assistant even

245
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,615
What's could be a smart home hub that's great but

246
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
Why are you doing the whole

247
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
Personal assistant on your own when the rest of the world is kind of

248
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Adopting

249
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,575
Several other ones I take for roughly

250
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,903
Between Apples Google's Amazon's and

251
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,511
Samsung I started thinking about this I'm like you know what I'm just going to maybe

252
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,071
Kabul my own thing together just a small

253
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
Couple wheeled robot that has a

254
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
Camera on it so I can

255
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,703
Follow me around tomatoes are not very expensive

256
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,543
And then I'm going to just put a Google home on it with a battery

257
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,895
So that battery lasts as long as

258
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
When I said that Stacy was like

259
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,247
You have a very different idea

260
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
For what

261
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
You want a robot and then

262
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
What I want

263
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
What did you find

264
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
I don't want something that follows

265
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,255
Site I'd rather have these devices

266
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
In each room

267
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
Stationary

268
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
From your robot has to

269
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
Mastiff

270
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
I mean

271
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
I'd rather shout at something

272
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,311
Just another thing for me to trip over when I

273
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
Trying to get stuff done

274
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,687
Needs to be able to like unload the dishwasher

275
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Transfer laundry

276
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
Those are the things

277
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,575
Like my house is pretty automated

278
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
As it stands and I can shout and get

279
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Things done

280
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,975
The next level of tasks that I want to take out of my

281
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
Grind are those that

282
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Require

283
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,655
I know and I do get that in fact over the weekend I was looking at

284
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,959
Camera modules for robots

285
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
Things like that

286
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
They are not cheap

287
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
Unless that she

288
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:03,711
You can get cheaper ones but they only can lift anywhere from 8 to 11 ounces of weight

289
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Is next to nothing that's not good.

290
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
So

291
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
Yasso

292
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
Cost is not

293
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,975
Where do you need to be for that yet

294
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:19,583
Let me next Monday snow object I'm sure you could buy a robot that does everything you want to do but

295
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
I could probably just buy a house

296
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
Pikachu

297
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,383
And that's because it's kind of a robot

298
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
It does a lot of

299
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
The mass of cooking for me

300
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
And that's kind of what I'm looking for

301
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
Tasks that otherwise

302
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
And that's xmnx

303
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,255
That's fairly, that's what room has done since day one

304
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
Great Titans

305
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
There you go

306
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,679
Oh you know what

307
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
2Go unstick the room but when I go

308
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Gets stuck under

309
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,847
I need a robot to unstick my other robot

310
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:10,527
I don't know I mean yes I mean I know I don't need a robot to do what I wanted to I could have a speaker in every room

311
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
Sancerre for 3-g Speed

312
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,415
Nice especially as these things start getting anticipatory

313
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
And

314
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,303
I'm sitting there watching TV I wouldn't mind having it

315
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,863
Podcast

316
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
Yeah I know

317
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,287
New

318
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,127
Long story short I do wonder why a lot of

319
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,687
Robotic type companies are trying to do it all

320
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
Especially when it comes to the personal system space

321
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Dentistry

322
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
Jibo

323
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
All right

324
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Spa music

325
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
Let's talk about

326
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
Smart radar detector

327
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,095
Yeah I came across this over the weekend as well there's a company

328
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
How are things

329
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
That has a smart radon detector

330
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,263
Actor caught the wave it is $199

331
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
I don't know if right on the big deal

332
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,407
All the listeners are here in Southeastern Pennsylvania it's a very big deal

333
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
Discuss the rock formation is underneath Pennsylvania

334
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
Radon is bad so

335
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,319
Well we had a lot of issues here every home has to have a

336
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,135
Radon inspection before it's purchased and so on so

337
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,719
What this does though it's kind of like a carbon monoxide detector

338
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
Water detector for Radon

339
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
It works with

340
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,607
If this then that and the company

341
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:32,959
They sent me an email as well because

342
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,287
Hook it up that if they're in your house

343
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,615
You know you can have your lights turn red

344
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,943
Turn on a fan or AC

345
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,295
Stacy I would like my son

346
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,343
Play like a nuclear war

347
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
Sound

348
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,159
It would freak my family out

349
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,791
But obviously there's a lot you could do with this because it is a connected radon detector so that was kind of dressing

350
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
I like it I do not have radon issues

351
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
However

352
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
I'm all for you not getting

353
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
How much is it

354
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
At 199

355
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,407
How much is a note on the second floor so that way

356
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,735
How much is it normally how much is a normal

357
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,903
I don't know I mean I don't I don't have one usually people come in with radon test kits

358
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,439
This isn't like a CO2

359
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:31,583
This is just us radon Uso

360
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,375
It's another $70

361
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,215
The wave + measures indoor air quality plus radon

362
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,543
I don't see a smoke detector and radon

363
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,431
Alright let's see in a move to bring it back

364
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
Google home

365
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:52,063
Amazon has taken its Echo and it brings music

366
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,671
By the way

367
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
So it's not to set up your

368
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
This basically means like

369
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
If your

370
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
Good morning or good night

371
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,191
Have a good night routine

372
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
And I can now add

373
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Play

374
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,799
Spotify

375
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
4

376
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,943
Yeah you probably can I actually can't because my

377
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,015
Madame a app for iOS has not been updated yet

378
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
So what

379
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,343
Feeling it has four

380
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,903
Android I'm just taking a wild guess on that one

381
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:33,791
Streaming services supported for this are Spotify Pandora Amazon music of course

382
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
IHeart Radio in TuneIn

383
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Cuz we are on

384
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,495
The internet

385
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
Kings podcast

386
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,055
Respond

387
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
Speaking of Google

388
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,199
You can now finally control your nest secure from Google

389
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
Assistant

390
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,295
Which is nice because originally

391
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,599
The Nest secure security system

392
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,159
Arnot from your app

393
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,463
Or using the tags or the keypad

394
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
And I thought that was kind of

395
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,607
I actually wanted the nest cameras to be like I recognize your face I will arm it

396
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
Disarm it when I see them

397
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:14,239
Google Assistant can just say it instead of

398
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
So

399
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,639
You can even ask the status of the security system with at 2

400
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:28,063
PNC login she just take things I'll never buy for $500 Alex

401
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,743
So sigfox is working with Louis Vuitton not a company I purchased from just cuz it

402
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Expensive

403
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,119
They have a new luggage tracker using sigfox technology

404
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,775
It works with certain Louis Vuitton Horizon luggage bags and I don't know the price of those I'm sure there's

405
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,127
You have to go in the store actually find out how much cuz you can't find out online

406
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
And

407
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,527
Track your checked luggage in major airports and there's a whole list of supported airports

408
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,343
And why is that important

409
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,183
Stacy why is it only certain airports

410
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
They have to have some sort of

411
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
It's the equivalent of a cell tower

412
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
It's not a cell tower

413
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,607
A radio receiver so when you're in those airports

414
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
Your luggage can talk to

415
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
The tower

416
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
Basic facts main gateway

417
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,615
Outside ever far from the airport but it will track

418
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,151
It while you're at the airport

419
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
It seems the sigfox Monarch service

420
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Teresa

421
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
And it's got about

422
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,087
25 US airports including all the big ones that you would expect

423
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
International

424
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,487
If you're going

425
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,839
And yes

426
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
Seems exciting

427
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
I wish I knew what the price was

428
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:51,263
I personally just stick a tile in my bag actually my husband sticks

429
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
He tracks it

430
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
There

431
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
This is yet another

432
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,919
Let's talk about the future of our fridges

433
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
It's kind of scary.

434
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
Do you think

435
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
I went to take a piss

436
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:10,207
I'll tell them what this is Nancy if you have some thoughts interesting article in

437
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:16,095
Venturebeat this week talking about emotion AI or affective computing

438
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,887
Basically

439
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,727
This is a way for a connected device to determine your emotion

440
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,823
And the example was a smart fridge

441
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:31,199
That would suggest Foods based on your emotion or your mood

442
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,551
And I guess that's I think that's a good idea because there are certain

443
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,879
Turn to comfort food and such and that's not necessarily the best thing

444
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,903
In the world

445
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,207
It gets to the question do we want

446
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
Our emotions and

447
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,791
Bluetooth devices tomatoes

448
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,143
I would say yes because we're always talking about context right

449
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,983
This is like the next level of context in actually

450
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,287
It's something that people have been thinking about

451
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,823
For as far back is to

452
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
2009

453
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,871
I remember talking to

454
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,895
The people about this city

455
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Freescale

456
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
And they were talking about how to

457
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,039
Detect people's emotions from their voice

458
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
On their phones

459
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
And

460
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
Assigning those emotions to be

461
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,671
Trying to figure out what they could

462
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
Julie emotions are just

463
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,839
Again more contacts so if you walk in the house angry

464
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
You don't maybe your home

465
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,911
Play some soothing music

466
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
Fridge could offer you some ice

467
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,055
Then that makes sense I guess

468
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,687
I'm stuck on trying to put this technology into every single device I would rather have it centralized

469
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,503
Maybe in my robot that follows me around all day

470
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,551
Or my assistant whatever

471
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
Digital assistant

472
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
I'm using

473
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:46,463
As opposed to each individual thing like I want my house to know but I don't need

474
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,743
AutoZone points

475
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
So you don't

476
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,583
Calculating your emotional score at the mo

477
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,495
Yeah I mean it is a lot of a computing power at the

478
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
Right

479
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,639
Here's my heart we're going back to the robots

480
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,503
Coming back with this sort of skill

481
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
In baby

482
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,623
The context in brain of your house is like a cute little robotic pet

483
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
Companion

484
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,744
I can live with that I could to be kind of fun

485
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,792
Hey French this person is really sad

486
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
Offer them some chocolate

487
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,144
Enter test that I could take my

488
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
Idea of the robot in the Google home sick

489
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,288
And just put a Google home on my dog

490
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,384
Yes that would I would like video

491
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
And how we smart

492
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,272
So Google story

493
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Google

494
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,344
Might make its own smart display

495
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Oh

496
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,768
I was so hot for that Lenovo one that we saw at CES

497
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,840
And this is our friend

498
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
He's the best

499
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,448
Yasso

500
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
I don't know

501
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
Cuz this is coming out in the summer the Lenovo one

502
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,896
Right right so hopefully within the next three months or so

503
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,712
Cuz I would like to have have to say

504
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
Like I just

505
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:19,136
Talked about this a minute just installed a nest doorbell in one of the things I'm looking forward to is actually pulling that up

506
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
On my

507
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,488
So but having just a little

508
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
Google display would actually be

509
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,608
Yeah I do that today with the shield as a crumb

510
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:33,216
Cast capable device I do that but like on a 50-inch TV and I don't need endoscopy inch TV

511
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,264
It'd be nice out on a date or 10 in

512
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,336
Tablet display like this like a Lenovo one

513
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:43,456
I suspect I don't know obviously but I suspect that next month at Google IO

514
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,296
We'll hear more about smart Display Devices

515
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,624
And other partners cuz I can't believe it when I was the only one

516
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:57,280
And as in treating Zone Hardware brand products

517
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:03,424
I could easily see them by maybe by the end of the year 900 but talk about 80 or introduce a

518
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
You know a home screen

519
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,776
Google home screen device or something to that effect

520
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
I am with you

521
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
The best takeaway from this article

522
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,688
Is Rishi Chandra who's in charge he's a

523
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
VPN

524
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
Home Products

525
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,600
He said the simple truth is we need to become a must-have

526
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,160
He's looking for daily use

527
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:29,536
Cases so basically he Home Products

528
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,840
And he said they're not

529
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
So

530
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:41,056
I guess I can see that I mean, the old adage say the best assistant is the one that you have with you

531
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,848
You know what it's on your wrist in your room

532
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:47,712
In your car whatever on your phone think of how much I actually use my

533
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,272
It's not like multiple times an hour

534
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
But it several times a day

535
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
I use mine

536
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,792
More but I did have to make a concerted

537
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
So

538
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,424
Final news bit is

539
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,472
Iot platform provider electric in

540
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,824
Just going to work indirectly integrate with Microsoft

541
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
Asher's program

542
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,384
Managed services

543
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
This is like just a small bit of news

544
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
Electric imp provides

545
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
Secure

546
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,296
Radio

547
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,392
Compute platforms for iot it's probably one of its biggest clients

548
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,184
Pitney Bowes I think side axle

549
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,720
Physical fitness

550
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,256
Equipment company uses it

551
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,304
You basically stick Electric in pinyin

552
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,328
And you got a connection

553
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
That's the

554
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
Pitched companies

555
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,288
With AWS and so this just extended to Microsoft azure

556
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,360
And we totally expect these things to happen

557
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,384
It's always nice

558
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,432
It's interesting that

559
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:54,528
Few companies iot tech companies are relying on a single

560
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,320
Iot Cloud providers

561
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,368
You stay say something more and more of this

562
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,440
Oh yeah that's because they're there in customers want

563
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,488
A choice in AWS does not have

564
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
The lock on my

565
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
By any stretch

566
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
Rizzo okay quick settings

567
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,960
I was prepared to talk to you about my experience with the nest hello doorbell

568
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
Nest Yale lock

569
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Sadly

570
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:20,896
My experience is paused because I went to install the nest hello doorbell

571
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,968
239 doorbell very excited

572
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,504
Because it's got

573
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
Great reviews

574
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
And

575
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
I love Turtles

576
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,744
I'm not in love with my current doorbell but

577
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,048
You know I'm always up for something new and something

578
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,704
I've had a little bit of a challenge installing it Nest actually recommends a professional install

579
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,752
Actually very proud

580
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
The doorbells

581
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
Maybe

582
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
Is a recognition of the market

583
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,152
Installing door Bells is maybe harder

584
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,456
I have not got my to work yet

585
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
It says it's not drawing enough

586
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Power

587
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,808
Can I find that confusing because

588
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,112
Just a few months back

589
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,904
Replace my doorbell transformer

590
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,976
From a 16 volt which is what most doorbells

591
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
Transformers are

592
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,048
In your own 24 volt

593
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,144
And I would recommend install a video doorbell

594
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
Do this

595
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
Because a lot of them say that the work

596
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
Between 16 in

597
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,568
But 16 is really the bare minimum

598
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Struggle

599
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
And that means that you get

600
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
Higher latency

601
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
The picture doesn't always Roar

602
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
She's not as good

603
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
Transformer

604
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,392
I cannot

605
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
Emphasize

606
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:41,536
Are reinforcements and Elsa and I think a lot of people

607
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,120
Smart

608
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,168
It's very common to have

609
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,728
Change your transfer because the power requirements

610
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,032
And it's not expensive to do that it's not

611
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
Difficult to do that either

612
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,384
It's going to cost you ten or fifteen dollars at most of the Transformers

613
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,200
You shouldn't take you more than 10 or 15 minutes to replace

614
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,248
But just be forewarned

615
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:07,392
Going to get a smart doorbell at least look at the box and see what it says about the Transformer and the energy requirements needed to do this

616
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
Because I C

617
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,512
Countless support for on the same network

618
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
And almost

619
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,864
Cheese I can't tell you how many times it's the power it's just not enough

620
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,680
Part of this is on the doorbell company

621
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
To do it

622
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
I think

623
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,408
Vanessa's house is yours every 16 volts

624
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,200
You don't fit

625
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,224
Right now it's just

626
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,344
Here and I do have a weird doorbell setup so

627
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,904
We're going to troubleshoot that because I really want to get this work

628
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Awesome

629
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
And

630
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,256
So far I will say that it is

631
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,280
It is lovely

632
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,584
Installation instructions are very easy

633
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,656
Making sure that the device compatible

634
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,192
With your product

635
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
With your existing doorbell setup

636
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,520
So that the video

637
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,544
10 solitaire

638
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,592
You know

639
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,872
So far so good

640
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,736
Now it's time

641
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,552
The iot podcast listener hotline

642
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,600

742 4

654

And now

655
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
People

660

Right out of the box

661
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,928
So you don't have to have a smart home system to benefit

662
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464

Isolation Kevin my wife lie has the Google homes and socialites and S

666
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:59,520
Google started recognizing our voices sometimes but it's been pretty annoying

667
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,824
Sharing routines or scenes are flows

668
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,176
So what's the best way to program something once

669
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
In one place

670
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:11,808
Available to my wife's on the Google home without having to do anything on her phone

671
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
Thank you

672
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Zach

673
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,696
As we said earlier in the show a tenant

674
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
First off

675
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:22,816
This is not something I can count because Google does not actually recognize me

676
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,864
As an individual person in my house

677
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
It only recognizes my husband

678
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
My voice is just weird

679
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Show

680
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,544
I cannot physically replicate this problem

681
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
For you

682
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,872
I did look around for solution

683
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,832
Yeah again it gets to the way things are designed to work in the home is it for the home is it for the user

684
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,136
Short of replicating the

685
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:51,232
The routines which is what you don't want to do obviously and I don't blame you

686
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:56,352
I think what really has to happen here is for the software whether it's for

687
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,168
Google home or Amazon or whomever

688
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
There needs to be some

689
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,520
Global or home routines

690
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,800
That everybody can use

691
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:10,176
Straight so that there isn't that she said so there's no there's no way to do this yet without

692
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Replicating

693
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,248
So we're sorry for the bad news

694
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,880
Even something as simple as saying I'm in a family with this person

695
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
You know

696
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,464
Can you commit a shareable routines

697
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,256
Just click their name next to the

698
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Routine

699
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
You know

700
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
I don't know

701
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,376
The Google please let's get this work

702
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
Also

703
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,448
If you could figure out how to recognize me that

704
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264
An added bonus

705
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,568
Okay and before we go this week

706
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,104

So let's kick this off

733
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
What is Fortran

734
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,128
Iraq is a digital identity

735
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,432
And what we do is we create a platform

736
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
That allows us to do

737
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:51,296
All the traditional stuff you would think about when you think about identity whether it be

738
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,160
Provisioning of users management of their data

739
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:01,792
Sportmix for track really fun and exciting is that we take those traditional Technologies and we bring it to New

740
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,816
Awesome digital you

741
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,864

00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,520
It's personalized for you it knows who you are

744
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
What you've done in the past

745
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
I don't understand

746
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
What the type of experience you want

747
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,408
To be able to do that at

748
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,224
Scale and do what the flexibility that a lot of

749
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,296
Digital transformation project

750
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,832
That's what for. Specialized

751
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,112
Awesome

752
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,672
To part of some of those use cases

753
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:34,816
Is personalization but as for Discovery right now personalization requires that we share data with

754
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
How do we

755
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,632
Do that well in a

756
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
Post Cambridge analytica

757
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
What's a great question

758
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,752
I need to think if you look at this

759
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
Kind of

760
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,568
War of disintermediation that's

761
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,360
Occurring right now where every

762
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:51,200
Company is trying to be closer with consumers or trying to get direct

763
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
Consumers

764
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
Possible

765
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,040
And everyone is competing with Amazon

766
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,344
I think one of the advantages that keep

767
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,672
People forget about Amazon is people all created their Amazon account

768
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:03,488
15 years ago login and haven't logged out since

769
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,072
Amazon just been collecting all this data ever since and so

770
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
Everybody else now

771
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
Getting on that

772
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,704
And try to collect as much data as possible in order to

773
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,984
Give you a great personal life

774
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,056
Experience I think it's becoming more and more important that people

775
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
Understand

776
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,920
What these vendors are doing with their data and I think it's important

777
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:27,296
For vendors that want to offer a personalized experience to make a fair deal with their customers

778
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,344
About what they're going to do with the data

779
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,416
And make sure they give them the appropriate tools

780
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
To provide consent

781
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
And how does forgerock

782
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,560
Has built into our flat

783
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
Builtwith

784
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
Tyrosine

785
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
Consent in mine

786
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,168
And so we were the first vendor

787
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
To take advantage of

788
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,008
The standard of the user managed access

789
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,360
It scored or products we allow an end-user taxi determine

790
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,176
Which of their personal data they want to share and with

791
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,224
And so it allows a vendor that is

792
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
Is one stick electrician

793
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,576
Those levers built into their product

794
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,648
Becky but user control over what type of data they're staring

795
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,744
Awesome all right so then where can we go to find out more about 4

796
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,792
So is it good or website

797
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,376
You find some amazing stuff about what 4:00 and 4 drop test

798
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
Arguing

799
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,680
To protect their crops

800
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,448
Privacy

801
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,496
And so you should go to for draft.com

802
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:24,896
Glass privacy

803
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,528
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

804
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:36,160
This is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Alicia white who's the founder of her own

805
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,744
Company logical elegance and the host of the embedded

806
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,048
Hi Lisa how are you doing today

807
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,704
Hi Stacy so nice to talk to you man I am super excited to have you because guys as I said before earlier in the show

808
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
Alicia is a

809
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Embedded

810
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
Systems engineer

811
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,568
And probably going what

812
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,152
We're going to solve that first query by saying hey

813
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,944
Alycia tell us a little bit about

814
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
What an embedded system

815
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
Dictionary

816
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,808
When I talk to people who aren't engineers

817
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
I tell them

818
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:08,416
That I write software for things that aren't computers

819
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,488
And I've gotten to do some pretty neat things like

820
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,048
Children's toys in DNA scanners

821
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,840
But it's a simple is

822
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,400
Your microwave or your car or even yourself

823
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,424
Listings

824
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,240
Aren't the same as writing on big web

825
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,544
Servers or even laptop

826
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
Cuticles

827
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:30,688
Until we call them embedded systems it has a lot more to do with the hardware and software working

828
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
Together to do

829
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,016
And so as you guys may have surmised

830
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,320
This is really important in the internet

831
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
How

832
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:44,256
Have you seen your role as an embedded systems engineer changed in the last I don't know 5 years sio tbk

833
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
Came all this

834
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,792
Cheesecake

835
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,608
Pirate he's been coming for a longer than that

836
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,680
But it has definitely started to hit that hockey

837
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,216
And it has changed

838
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,496
Before

839
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
We had

840
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,824
The dumbest possible devices

841
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,408
Talking to a hub of some kind you think about your Hue Lights

842
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,504
Will you have tiny tiny microprocessor is inside light bulbs

843
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:09,856
Talking to a hub that then can translate so that it can get onto the internet

844
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,672
And yet a few years ago these

845
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,976
$4 Wi-Fi chips came out

846
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
Things could connect

847
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,792
Directly to the internet

848
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
And

849
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
Olive

850
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,168
These possibilities opened up until we had

851
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:26,496
Way too many things directly connecting to the internet

852
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,032
Insecurity problems

853
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
And all of the

854
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,848
Changes

855
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,384
All about the dress

856
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
Connection

857
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,992
The things that go behind the gateways in the edge

858
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,528
Or fog computing

859
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,832
Those are a little simpler when you think about wearables

860
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,624
Fitbit in going to your phone

861
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,416
But when we talk about

862
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
Wi-Fi

863
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
Then

864
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,584
Those things are kind of unprotected for the deep and scary see the internet of

865
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:56,192
Okay you've brought up a lot of things and we're going to get to some of them but first

866
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:00,288
Let's go back to this idea of what an embedded systems engineer Spencer

867
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
Their time doing

868
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
And how you get to the

869
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,176
Roles in an organization or maybe just in your life

870
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,504
So I don't know if you want to tell us a little bit about your history

871
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:13,344
I went to school at a small engineering school and

872
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,464
I took all of the applied computer science courses and all of these theoretical engineering course

873
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,256
That left me with a lot of

874
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:25,376
Series about signal processing and a lot of time writing code

875
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:31,776
I didn't know that this would be the perfect degree for doing things like audio processing and motor control

876
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,360
But it was and I was lucky to fall into that I love

877
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
Making

878
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,688
The world change through my software

879
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,736
The first time you get your motor

880
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,552
To move because you wanted it to is just magical

881
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,392
Stop pushing bits over the internet and you start

882
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
Moving

883
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
The world

884
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,232
A lot of people come from the computer science

885
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,840
Almost an equal number company electrical engineering

886
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,376
There's a problem here

887
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,424
Most of us only

888
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,704
Went to school for one of the

889
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,568
Perfume or embedded and computer engineering degrees coming out now

890
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,592
But still it's

891
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,664
Pretty tough to know both of these disciplines all the way down

892
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,456
And yet that's what we do

893
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,504
You have to learn the other half on the job

894
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,808
Wow okay so

895
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,880
That's a little scary because that implies that

896
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,464
Well maybe a lot of people coming into this field

897
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,256
At first they don't

898
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,584
No entirely what they're doing so you're either going to miss out on the

899
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,912
Taking care of the motor side or you're going to miss out on the

900
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
Taking care of its side

901
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:36,800
Yeah it's easy to be afraid of the hardware and actually touching

902
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
Bored

903
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,664
On the other side the electrical engineers don't necessarily know

904
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,296
That you can write your software to be far more efficient if you know a bit more about data structures and algorithms

905
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:53,184
The things that computer science people that's what they do and so it is definitely a

906
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
Specialization

907
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,536
This isn't the thing you go into right after college

908
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:01,632
Unless you were on the robotics team or or already had some experience

909
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,168
Disciplinary approaches

910
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
Instead of something you

911
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,752
Kind of look out for a while and say

912
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:12,640
Well I'm writing software now and that looks like fun and then you get a little bit closer in a little bit closer and then suddenly

913
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
Pics of your life

914
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:19,808
Actually sounds kind of like a good analogy for iot as a whole which is this whole real world meets the digital world

915
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,624
All the cast that can ensue so

916
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,160
With that in mind

917
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,208
What can you see about things that

918
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,488
Maybe you seen in your

919
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,512
Professional life

920
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,048
And how this is going to play out with

921
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
Coyote

922
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:35,168
Again real world meets digital world and things that people aren't really thinking

923
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,728
Prevention security is

924
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,032
Yeah security is

925
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,336
Is a constant battle and it's

926
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,616
Scary because

927
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,664
We are connecting medical devices

928
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,688
To the internet

929
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
Things that can

930
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
Truly affect lives

931
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
A car

932
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
Qunar traffic light

933
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,880
We can't just leave those open

934
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,440
For some kid to come by when they're bored at

935
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:01,536
After school and yet we're never going to get to the point that it determined hacker

936
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
With physical access

937
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,376
Isn't going to be able to do whatever they want

938
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
Did it balance

939
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,216
That but you're such a balanced how much does all this cost

940
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,752
When we buy

941
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
Internet-enabled

942
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
Light switch

943
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:17,408
So you can plug something in and then you can control whether or not it's on remotely

944
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,176
And yet

945
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,760
When you go when you buy them on Amazon or at the store

946
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,296
There's the $4 one

947
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,576
And $30

948
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,624
Go get the $30 one

949
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,952
Because what does it say on the Box about it being differ

950
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,256
Nothing that you can understand

951
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,280
I mean

952
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,864
Wapk 2493

953
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,168
ISO 44 blah blah

954
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,984
How do we convey to Consumers

955
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,288
So this is important and as consumers

956
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,336
How do we recognize that yes

957
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
Is worth the extra money

958
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,176
To let me talk about security we have to talk about price

959
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
2

960
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,760
So the last two decades that you have been doing this

961
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,064
Things have started connecting to the internet and that's

962
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,136
A big change but it's also big change in

963
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:04,768
How long we think he stinks need to last cuz it used to be you could buy something I have a bread maker

964
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,328
Like the 1980s that has a computer in it

965
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,352
Instaworks

966
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,144
Paperwork connected to the internet

967
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
I feel like maybe it would not have lasted

968
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
Oh yes

969
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,520
And there are so many reasons for that

970
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
And it's

971
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,848
Hard as a developer it's very difficult

972
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,896
To try to plan ahead

973
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:25,760
Medical devices is a good one because those are often long lasting

974
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,528
Thanks

975
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,112
Cars are another area where we have embedded software

976
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:36,512
I made design something to go into a car and he won't go in for two or three years and then the car is expected to last

977
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,048
After 15 or 30 years

978
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
How am I going to search

979
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,352
Work.

980
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:46,240
That long we hear all about these firmware update to how important they are for security reasons among other things

981
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,824
But if I'm supporting five different cars

982
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,616
Over 30 years

983
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,895
How do I test

984
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
D I did not

985
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,735
To update your firmware

986
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,855
But then you end up with things like we heard about Apple where their batteries were

987
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
Being throttled

988
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:07,999
And party music or will that totally makes sense another part of me as a consumer was like no that's awful

989
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:08,767
And you have the

990
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,559
Push and pull again about

991
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,631
How do you make it so you can

992
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,167
I think last long

993
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,447
But also act fast

994
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
NB cheap

995
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,007
Beyond the market

996
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,543
And support all the device

997
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
I think

998
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:26,175
Ventura technology is one that we're going to end up having to learn front because he's printers

999
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:29,503
Came out 15 years ago still have their driver up

1000
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,783
And it's a lot

1001
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,831
About the standardization of their interface

1002
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,879
Zombie see more of that in the few

1003
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:39,743
Oh that's really interesting about course printers are some of the most hated machines on the

1004
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
The planet

1005
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,303
Yeah

1006
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,375
Yeah that was an unintentional parallel

1007
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,679
Okay

1008
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:52,799
This is actually the Apple thing is a great example cuz this touches on something that I think we're going to see more

1009
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,615
Which is this engineering mindset where

1010
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,895
If you talk to an engineer

1011
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
It's wonderful

1012
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
Because

1013
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,527
I understand trade-offs in every decision they make is basically

1014
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
Optimizing against trade

1015
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,367
Yes for some particular subset of

1016
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:10,207
In consumers we don't think that way

1017
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,487
We want it all

1018
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,023
Or the cheapest price

1019
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
Possible

1020
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:18,911
When those two kind of things come into play It's not that Apple was necessarily being

1021
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,471
Evil they just were thinking like an engineer

1022
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,263
And as we have more technology.

1023
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,311
I'm very curious

1024
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,847
How you see these kind of

1025
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
I guess

1026
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:31,967
Conflicts I don't know if they're really complex just differences in point of view

1027
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,759
Getting resolved between

1028
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,551
In the business world but also for

1029
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
Consumer I

1030
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
I have to admit

1031
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
I'm an engineer

1032
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,183
I'm so an engineer

1033
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:44,511
And like I said I understand why Apple did what they did it made sense

1034
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
But

1035
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,815
We can't

1036
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,095
Be that close minded

1037
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,119
Impart

1038
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,423
Because we have an obligation to work us

1039
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
And

1040
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,007
It's going to keep happening

1041
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
That there's this

1042
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,103
Butting of heads between engineers and customers

1043
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,151
A good marketing department

1044
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,431
Can figure that out

1045
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,223
Can mediate

1046
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,015
Between the needs of the customers

1047
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,039
And the

1048
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,319
Goals of engineering

1049
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
I don't

1050
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,671
Think there's going to be an easy solution some of it

1051
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,487
To me because I am an engineer and this is all

1052
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,511
Normal to me

1053
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,327
I think everybody should be technologically literate

1054
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,399
Yeah people say that to me about

1055
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,935
I don't know Macintosh

1056
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,215
I can't

1057
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,239
I'm sorry

1058
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,311
So now we're getting kind of into this idea of

1059
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,847
How do you communicate

1060
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,895
The people about the functionality and how

1061
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,663
Tanks work

1062
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:38,527
But let's talk about what it takes what kind of team it takes to build an iot device

1063
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:42,879
Because I think a lot of the company's coming at this tend to be like oh

1064
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,903
I've made a nap

1065
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,511
00 hire someone and I have this idea for a product so I'll build it out of a pie and then

1066
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,047
Open a Kickstarter in Macon

1067
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,863
I think we're kind of over that now but what do you think

1068
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,167
Company really needs to have

1069
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
OnStaff to build

1070
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,519
Well I should say build a connected device

1071
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,079
When you ship software you're sipping Electra

1072
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:07,455
But when you ship Hardware you have to ship the protons to and they're much heavier

1073
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,503
Far more difficult

1074
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:14,623
If I got to build a whole team like I was we're going to build a

1075
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:18,975
A hundred thousand of these things and there's going to be enough money to hire all the people

1076
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,815
You want a systems engineer to look over all the peace

1077
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,607
Is to make sure that they're all going to fit together

1078
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
And

1079
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,911
That person

1080
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,495
We'll talk to a mechanical engineer that will help design the Box

1081
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:35,615
And make sure that the boards fit inside the box and the box is pleasing to the customer

1082
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,919
The electrical engineer will Design boards

1083
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:43,807
And make sure that they're manufacturable and their parts are all going to be available at the time that we want to ship this product

1084
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,855
Give embedded software engineer

1085
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,415
Who works on the software inside the product

1086
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,695
To make sure that these

1087
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,487
Security the connectivity

1088
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:56,095
The firmware update as well as all of the features that you're actually building into this product

1089
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
Are there

1090
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,423
And are there on a processor that is cheap

1091
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,191
Cheap enough to build

1092
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,727
Dimension Raspberry Pi

1093
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:06,847
You know they have some of those that aren't too expensive and so it's a good way to go if you're going to build a hundred or something

1094
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,127
100

1095
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
Thousand something

1096
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
He wants to be more

1097
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,711
Motorrad

1098
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
I think maybe resource

1099
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
Strained because

1100
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:18,879
It only needs to do the things you wanted to do your building a product you're not building a

1101
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,159
Computers Raspberry Pi

1102
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,463
Computer and you can hide it inside a product

1103
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,231
But

1104
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,279
If I was going to be cheaper if you actually

1105
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,607
And then on the other side you still need the software

1106
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:35,263
And you likely still need the back end and web developers and all of the other software Engineers you need to do to have a good

1107
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,287
Good app and good Prada

1108
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,335
But you have this whole other team

1109
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
And

1110
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,639
Why do Consulting

1111
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,943
And I enjoy it and I know

1112
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,735
Many people who are good at it

1113
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,783
Going to a

1114
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,599
Professional Services firm with a napkin sketch

1115
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,135
And idea

1116
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,415
They may do a great job

1117
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,439
Many of them do

1118
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
But they're not going to love it

1119
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,535
If you wants to build this

1120
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,607
You going to have to at least be that systems engineer who can talk

1121
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,935
And that means knowing a little bit about all the p

1122
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,751
Enough mechanical engineering to no other problems

1123
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,823
Enough electrical engineering to use the right words

1124
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,895
Enough embedded systems engineering to hire somebody

1125
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,943
You can balance your knees for

1126
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,991
Speed efficiency

1127
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,271
Power optimization

1128
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,575
Cost and getting to Market on time

1129
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111
The last person in the

1130
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,647
Chain is probably the menu for

1131
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,951
Fashion engineer the person who at the end

1132
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,487
Make sure you can build

1133
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,535
A hundred thousand of them on a line

1134
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
Whether it's

1135
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:35,935
In Mexico or China and United States wherever it is that person is going to optimize it so that

1136
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:40,799
The firmware update step that took 20 minutes now only takes 5 and that means your throughput is

1137
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,567
Pastor

1138
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,615
And your whole system cost

1139
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,711
I keep bringing up cost because it is something that is very important with internet at

1140
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:53,343
It's why we choose the $4 poorly security systems instead of the $30 Wilson

1141
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:57,439
The amount of software in the amount of harboring them isn't that different

1142
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:02,303
It's just how well its design so if we can get these $30 designs to be

1143
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,143
$10 then maybe we can start convincing people to use the good stuff

1144
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,447
I like it to use the good stuff

1145
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,471
All right

1146
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,287
You're making a great case for meeting

1147
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,823
All of these rolls and

1148
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,103
Especially in embedded systems

1149
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,151
Do you think

1150
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:20,479
This is a job that's going to become more in demand as we add

1151
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,015
More smarts to everything

1152
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,295
I hope so

1153
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:28,159
I think my job has changed over the last 20 years and I think it will continue to change

1154
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,463
I used to work more on 8-bit process

1155
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,511
Json getting the last

1156
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,047
Little psycho out of

1157
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,351
A processor so that I could use it

1158
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,119
To do something

1159
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,679
And now that's not as important

1160
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,519
The prices are so cheap and they're so power-efficient only occasionally have

1161
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,543
To really worry about

1162
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,311
How long thing

1163
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,871
I'm so much more memory than I used

1164
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,735
The onboard memory where the code lives and the RAM memory

1165
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,295
We're at the code executes or or can use variable

1166
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,855
But I worry more about power efficiency

1167
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,159
Making sure that if things are wearable

1168
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:04,255
Or even plugged in and need to be energy STAR certified

1169
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:09,375
That's a good thing that we didn't used to have even cell phones used to be bigger and now they're smaller and they

1170
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
I keep getting more and more

1171
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
Timmy x changed a lot

1172
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,727
And

1173
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,495
I'm glad

1174
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
I like learning thing

1175
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
I think

1176
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,847
That we will never quite make it go away

1177
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:22,943
Because there will always be a need to have it be more power efficient

1178
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
Or

1179
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,783
Have it be cheaper and more functional for one purpose

1180
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,063
On the other hand

1181
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:31,391
I don't think people will need to worry as much about

1182
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,159
Smaller detail

1183
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,207
I haven't needed to worry about

1184
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:34,975
Car detail

1185
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,791
I think it would be more approachable job in the

1186
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,351
And how this sounds cool

1187
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:43,423
How do people get into this job what's a good entryway

1188
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,983
Well if you're in high school or college

1189
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,287
I say immediately go out and join the robotics

1190
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:53,663
If you are a software engineer and want to learn more about Hardware there's this platform called Arduino

1191
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,735
It's fun it was originally designed

1192
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
For artists

1193
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:02,879
To use to make glowing and interactive displays until there's a lot of

1194
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,671
Orioles out there and they shouldn't be

1195
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:08,767
If you are a little beyond that because it is a little bit of

1196
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,559
Hobbyist only platform

1197
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
Look for the end beds

1198
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:17,215
These are a series of boards with online free compiler also that Teddy Torres.

1199
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
The good stuff

1200
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,543
And then if you want to go into it for a career

1201
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,311
I wrote a book

1202
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,615
Making embedded systems from O'Reilly

1203
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:30,015
And it talks Natalie about all of the things I think you should know about making great software for embedded system

1204
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,575
Also talks about getting hired in 10 minutes

1205
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:36,159
And mostly I would say try it

1206
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,695
If you get one of these boards

1207
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,743
You maybe spend 30 bucks

1208
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,767
China doll that

1209
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,303
You may find the

1210
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,583
This is really fun

1211
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,399
If you doing all kinds of

1212
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,447
Weird interesting pads

1213
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:53,311
Where your life becomes as much about the application and the customer as it is about the soft

1214
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,359
That's a really good time.

1215
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
To I

1216
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
Of course

1217
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,711
I meant I would second that I actually have an art

1218
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
Order ahead

1219
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:05,599
I didn't find it as fun I found it a little frustrating just because I didn't probably know enough

1220
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,647
But the worst case scenario is

1221
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,463
You can donate it to a school robotics club and

1222
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,255
Will welcome it with open arms

1223
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
So

1224
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,839
Worst case scenario you spend a little money

1225
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,375
You find you don't like it

1226
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,399
And then you get

1227
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,423
Goodwill

1228
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,191
From your school

1229
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,519
Alright well at least you thanks so much for coming on the show this week

1230
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,543
I really appreciate it

1231
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:30,943
It's been wonderful to talk to you that's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if

1232
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:37,343
