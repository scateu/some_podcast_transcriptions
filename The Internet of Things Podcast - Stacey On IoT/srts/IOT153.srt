You know me as yonomi and now back to the show

36
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
Okay

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,648
As referenced in our ad oh my gosh you guys Amazon

38
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
Just this week said that it would buy

39
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
Ring the maker of

40
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
The ring doorbells

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,096
Ring lights and ring outdoor security cameras

42
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,680
Maybe the ring security system

43
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Which is currently

44
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
Being

45
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
Cancel because of

46
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
Civil lawsuit

47
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,616
Yeah that's that's part of the story too but

48
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:00,992
I guess there's a couple pieces here to unpack one is how much we do know how much Amazon has

49
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
Buying ring for

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,904
River was 1 billion but then people saying it's the second largest amount

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,208
That Amazon has spent on acquisition

52
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,280
So maybe a bit more than a billion

53
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
Second largest

54
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,120
Largest was Whole Foods at 13th

55
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
2.7 billion

56
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
Zappos

57
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
Appears to be the second-largest at

58
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,824
2 billion

59
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,384
8 billion +

60
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
That's a pretty

61
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,296
After number

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,648
They said they estimate there are about 1.2

63
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,208
Million ring doorbells out there

64
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
So if we use the one point

65
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,304
2 million

66
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
Ring units sold

67
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:55,008
And we say on the low side is a 1.2 billion dollar deal Amazon's paying like $1,000

68
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,312
Hours per customer per doorbell

69
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,384
If I ring and I know they're not just buying customers

70
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,528
The buying new Rings assets and IP and I get that a wow that's a lot of money

71
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
It is a lot of fun

72
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
You know I suppose

73
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
I suppose it's

74
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,256
I know it's just a lot of money

75
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
It is a lot of money

76
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:21,631
We shouldn't ignore the fact that in December Amazon also bought

77
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:26,495
Which is a security company that also makes security cameras and doorbells

78
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,335
The interesting thing to know here Amazon seems to be

79
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
There's a couple

80
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,175
Thanks this gets into what I wrote about when the deal was announced but

81
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Review at quickly

82
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,015
One home security is essential

83
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
For the Smart Home

84
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:44,415
I know we talked a lot about automation cuz that's where heart lies most consumers buy into the Smart Home

85
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,999
Which home security systems is the number one reason that people buy stuff

86
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,047
Number 2 is Energy Efficiency

87
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
So you can't be

88
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,143
In a smart home without

89
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
And

90
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
Amazon

91
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
As its

92
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:03,615
Falling into this magical Madam a place where it's okay we're

93
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
Play double down on that I think what's happened is

94
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
They bought blink

95
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
For a technology powers

96
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,087
Has it started out as a chip company making aloe

97
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
Power video processor

98
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
And

99
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:22,303
That kind of technology is going to be key if we want these kind of sensors around the home at a low price and being batteries

100
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
Empowered

101
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,119
What is getting with ring is

102
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
Market share

103
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,543
Ring is by far the leader in this market is according to IHS it has about a 45% share of the Americas

104
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
Market in

105
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
Video doorbells

106
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
So

107
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:42,015
That's number one the other is there is Nest just lunch the doorbell their skybell there is August had a doorbell

108
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
Like really

109
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Ring was

110
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
The contender

111
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,647
So Amazon gets all of this

112
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,487
Classic hits

113
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
We can't see Aqua hired

114
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,399
Lawsuit with ATT

115
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
Because ATT had invested in off and was security products

116
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
There smart home kind of security

117
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Product

118
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,407
And they were 44 ring

119
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,039
Well that that's what it gets me through the other thing Amazon is getting here lawsuits

120
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,135
What happens with the prior tsutsumi obviously they're not going away

121
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,463
And Amazon has deeper Pockets than ring does obviously

122
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
So

123
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
What does X Change

124
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,351
What happened to nest in the Honeywell lawsuit after Google acquired

125
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,655
My gosh just a few months later it was settled

126
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,239
Yeah well maybe that's all part of this big number

127
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,007
Somehow

128
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:41,407
Yeah and it's so it also in addition to the ADT lawsuit it was also being sued by skybell for patent infringement

129
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
Darius doorbell

130
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
Video doorbell

131
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
Right

132
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
So

133
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
I don't know what happens to those

134
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
I reached out to people

135
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439
It's so new that people are kind of like a shrug

136
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
Right

137
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
We'll figure that out

138
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:04,191
We may never find out unless I'm going to assume the saying that these suits will be settled no hear about it soon

139
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
The next coming months

140
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,287
And I doubt we'll ever hear the sums that were

141
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,847
Presented for settling these suits

142
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:15,967
I would love to know that because taking back in that money out of the purchase price for reading

143
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,295
That's really what Amazon is paying for ring in my opinion

144
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:24,159
Has raised a lot of money they were actually going back

145
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
Again to the market

146
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
With around that would value them in a billion.

147
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,815
Color switches are around billion dollars it was just some

148
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,471
So it makes sense the price that people heard it makes sense it was around a billion and then it also makes sense

149
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:44,895
Right they went through six rounds and raised about 210 million dollars and they're looking for more

150
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,479
And that kind of speaks to how hard it is to profit in this market as well

151
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:55,135
Right you know

152
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,695
We traded company that was the exit and

153
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
What happened is it just

154
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
It couldn't get there

155
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Fast enough

156
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
It was selling well

157
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:10,239
But the doorbell my understanding is has a relatively High bill of materials licensing fees on their video

158
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
Testing machines

159
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,823
There's no scale potential there

160
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,127
There could be now with Amazon buying it

161
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,455
Casinos blinx technology

162
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,271
Well you can put links technology inside and

163
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,343
Amazon video processing

164
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Itself

165
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,439
SoundCloud it's not AWS

166
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,743
So there are definitely economic

167
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
Advantages to

168
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
All at all

169
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,423
It's a good deal the other thing that I think is really important to know

170
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
Well there's two

171
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,079
Is if you have a ring doorbell it is going to work for now just the same as it always has

172
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
So that means it will stay in great

173
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
With other platforms

174
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
Amazon

175
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,223
Ring says they are still can't

176
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
Doorbell

177
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
That's not out yet

178
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,439
So keep waiting on that and

179
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Then

180
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
Will that continue

181
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
I hope so

182
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,327
I would hate to see the Google flights

183
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:13,215
Especially with Google launching their visual display stuff I would love to be able to look at who's at my ring doorbell on my

184
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Google

185
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
I want to call it the Google show

186
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,591
The smartscreen like spaghetti sauce

187
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,039
I can do that today obviously with a nest in a Android TV

188
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
So I would hope that

189
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,415
That kind of thing continues I'm pretty sure that ring will continue on its own

190
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,951
Brandon all that so I don't

191
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
I don't expect massive changes

192
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:41,119
As far as what it's going to work with him but it won't work with I think we'll just be highlighted how well it works with Madam a

193
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:47,519
Yeah I don't know I feel like getting to this point where everybody's got Amazon is almost feels

194
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
You're going to have to have your own

195
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Ecosystem

196
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,175
So like the nest gear going into Google

197
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,223
And being more closely tied

198
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
I can see Amazon looking at that and saying

199
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
I guess we got to get our own dear to

200
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
Questions what happens to other partner

201
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
Canary

202
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
Or Skype

203
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,351
Those who are working with

204
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:18,751
So lots of question solidation it's going to be a mess as consumers

205
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
I'm kind of consumers

206
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,335
We could be host a little bit with our

207
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,687
Are devices that used to work in multiple ecosystems we may find them getting

208
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,759
Crunched which is a shame because we bought them

209
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
With the

210
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:36,671
Understanding that would work with multiple ecosystems

211
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Other

212
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,231
Companies get squeezed out now

213
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
MN

214
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:45,119
You know the products that you bought that don't have a big-name partner may not have a future

215
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Send it

216
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
That's sad

217
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
That is sad

218
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,359
I'm trying to think of all the devices

219
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,759
All the signals the end

220
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
Rush of startups

221
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,671
That came out in 2013 2012 All Around the iot

222
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,767
We saw this huge massive amount of kick-started in French

223
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,351
Crowdfunded in venture-backed companies in

224
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
2012

225
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
2013

226
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
Even a little in 2014

227
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,799
If you weren't out in finding America by then

228
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
You were kind of

229
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
Addalock in

230
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,711
We're seeing that with the end of a lot of devices and it's kind of sad so

231
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,295
We talked about this early on with Matt turkey was a guest a while back

232
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
And he was like yeah

233
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
There is over

234
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
I think he's right

235
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
Teresa

236
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Very sad

237
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
What else would we talk about

238
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,303
We can talk about a new camera

239
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,607
Yes let's talk about it

240
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
Clip is finally out

241
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,495
This is a camera they announce the Google IO and it was a

242
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
Yes that's correct

243
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
Is pizza

244
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
You said it somewhere and it decides the right time to take

245
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Picture and it takes it

246
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
And what kind of it outside the button so you can

247
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
Take pictures yourself but the idea is that

248
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
You're living your life in

249
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
Google decides what

250
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:20,863
Yeah which it's actually intelligent idea because Google has so much data from Google photos about you

251
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:27,519
You know who's in your family who the people you care about that you take pictures a lot of what pets you know do you have it in you take pictures of

252
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,103
It takes you from behind the camera and put you in front of the camera with those

253
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
People and things and

254
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
And intelligently

255
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,527
Captures that we supposedly captures you no meaningful memories

256
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,087
Did you read the reviews at all by the way

257
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
Yeah did you see any good ones

258
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:52,095
The surprise really excellent story about

259
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,399
Google clip in Lighthouse which is now out

260
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,703
Lighthouses another intelligent camera

261
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,823
In his his reviews weren't like these are not pictures that I used to taking

262
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,407
But it captured some really good moments that I would never

263
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
Captured or even noticed

264
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,039
Which is that good I think it's a totally different type of

265
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
So I think you expect

266
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
Much like people poo-pooed smartphone

267
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
Pictures

268
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
For their DSLR

269
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,279
DSLR

270
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
I think we're going to

271
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
This type of

272
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:30,239
Innovation for a while but I think we're going to start getting used to seeing them and then

273
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Start treasuring these Lake

274
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
Little moments

275
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
It captures

276
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,151
What degree is early days this is like the first

277
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
Camera of it

278
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:44,319
Kind so to speak in a mass-market level and it's going to take time for it to become smart enough to truly become Valley

279
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
So

280
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
I agree with you I wouldn't write it off I don't think it's quite ready for everybody to rush out and buy one based on what I've seen

281
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
And I'm not used one

282
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,911
But I read every review out there from people that I know and trust and I'm like yeah

283
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
It's just not

284
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:04,031
Not enough value for the turn $49 yet

285
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:10,431
The other thing to note is Google

286
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
You choose what images

287
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
So if

288
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
Google Clips catches you

289
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
Running across the living room in a towel

290
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
Work without any clothes

291
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
You can just delete

292
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
That would be a moment

293
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:31,167
It's doing its job it's capturing the memory I think the key here is recognized

294
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
Job of explaining this

295
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
Recognizing

296
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
This is a big thematic shift

297
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
Imaging technique

298
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,639
Beforehand we had cameras that were dumb

299
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,991
It just you know to make a judgment call a human had to be involved

300
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,575
Normal cameras but now the cameras are making their own judgments

301
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,135
Computers

302
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Which these are

303
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
Are so much

304
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:58,559
More scalable we're going to have the ability to make judgments about pretty much everything

305
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Every second

306
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,119
The day and that's actually really

307
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
Yeah you know I would say

308
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,335
Cameras actually a pretty smart even before this came out and I took away a lot of the

309
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,127
Human judgments in terms of

310
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
Composition near things like laser autofocus

311
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,551
Multi-point Focus so it can determine what the actual subject of the photo is

312
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
And these are all

313
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,879
Technical things not a I type things

314
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,183
Now we're adding a AI

315
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,535
You know that point and shoot type features of many cameras today are so smart that

316
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:34,399
Arrival at completely manual camera so to me this is the next step is just

317
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
It's a very first step

318
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
Sure so Aesthetics

319
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,079
We've been using AI for Aesthetics for a while now

320
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
Keep that in mind

321
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
It's a little freaky

322
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,063
Will probably talk more about this at other junctures

323
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,879
Let's move on to World Congress

324
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,207
The show of shows

325
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,047
Congress

326
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Is it

327
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,607
It is in Barcelona

328
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,191
So and also we should say this weekend is also happening in Germany

329
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,287
Not seeing a ton of great news out from that but check out the newsletter if you want

330
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
Some when it comes out

331
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
Back to Mobile World Congress

332
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,967
Qualcomm is doing couple things that I thought was interesting

333
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,015
One is the guy

334
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
They've taken their snapdragon

335
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,391
High-end phone chips and they created embedded versions

336
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,207
The important thing about these embedded versions

337
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,023
They're going to have support contracts for

338
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:38,143
5 years 7 years however they're going to be made for the embedded

339
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:44,799
This means that they're going to have a longer support life and be around for longer if you want to build them into your products

340
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:51,199
Yeah I need these are also very capable chips that the newest one is anyway because it's built on the Snapdragon 820 which

341
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:55,295
What was powering Flagship phones just two years ago

342
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,855
So it's not like a low-power type

343
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:02,463
Chip that you might see and say a smart plug or something this is going to have a lot of computing power

344
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,023
Relatively speaking front of to device

345
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,071
And computing power

346
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,887
All the connectivity that you would expect in basically

347
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
Longer support

348
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,543
Mostly lock support

349
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,943
They're going to standby some design considerations

350
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:30,111
Pokemon different types of pre-configured modules one is for LTE

351
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,927
Which is great because you can

352
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,463
Is a software development kit

353
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
And module

354
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,863
You buy it and then you seem connected to a variety of different LTE networks around the world which is just

355
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
Easier

356
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
If you're trying to build something

357
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,471
And then they also did

358
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
Pre-configured multi radio

359
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
Module 4

360
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,359
Alkota homes

361
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
Bluetooth Wi-Fi

362
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
All kinds of fun stuff

363
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,015
You're actually two different versions of that one has Wifi one does not

364
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,063
Yes

365
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
When is super low power

366
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,487
The other thing that jumped out to me

367
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,791
These two that were talking about now actually

368
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,839
Come with pre-integrated support for homekit

369
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
I'm like electricity

370
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,959
Yeah I'm still

371
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
I hear you

372
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
Okay good for them

373
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
It's Not Dead

374
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
Yet it won't ever

375
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
I shouldn't say that

376
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,223
No AT&T

377
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
They are

378
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,295
Powering all the connectivity for

379
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
Caterpillar

380
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
Which is

381
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,391
They make all kinds of industrial and farming

382
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Equipment

383
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:42,559
What school is they also had a very nice story and a SIM card announcement around

384
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,423
Google house in I pay attention to this because AT&T actually led the way with Kinect

385
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
10 cars

386
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,751
They are by far the dominant

387
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,799
Provider for connectivity in

388
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Vehicles

389
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,151
They've got in the US

390
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
Or the cut

391
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,503
So they picked the right Market there

392
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,647
And that was good and I'm interested because now if they're really doubling down or focusing hard on medical

393
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,975
Then maybe it's actually time for medical 2

394
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
To be a thing

395
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,047
I feel like I've been saying this for a decade

396
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:21,471
You know it's funny because I remember - this goes back about 6-7 CSS ago

397
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,007
Seeing the

398
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,055
Little Pill cases that had

399
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Connectivity in them

400
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,359
Adding wood

401
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,943
Take your medicine and then

402
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,783
It could determine if you didn't if you didn't it could use that connectivity to like

403
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,183
Reach out to a healthcare provider say hey this person I don't remember

404
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
There you go

405
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
Yeah so

406
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
It's time again for that I can talk with

407
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:52,191
Yeah well okay but see take the Qualcomm

408
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
LTE bass modules

409
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,823
And that's the kind of product a

410
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
Medical device manufacturer

411
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,639
Watch so red

412
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
High-powered snapdragon

413
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,991
You know capabilities with long-term

414
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,527
Ish support

415
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,063
And so

416
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
We could be seeing

417
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,367
What we need to make

418
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
That happened

419
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,951
Okay let's get to Bass news bits

420
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,095
Yeah so this kind of came out of nowhere just happened to be the person in charge basically out of

421
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
MattyB

422
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:27,263
And also the person who created The Madam a prize which is a million-dollar prize to create a chatbot for

423
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
I can interact with a human

424
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,335
Buy sell for 20 minutes

425
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,383
His name is Ashwin Ram

426
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:38,015
And he has left Amazon is now the technical director of AI at

427
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
The Google

428
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:49,279
As a bonus to this Kevin has found a really interesting about conversation

429
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,839
Because you should read this conversation

430
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:57,727
Yeah these are the actual conversations that the people going for the Madame a present as a million-dollar prize by the way

431
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:02,079
We're trying to win so these are there people testing the chatbots

432
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,431
The conversations are sometimes scary but also very interesting

433
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:12,063
By the way question from one of our listeners who was

434
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,416
British spelling

435
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,952
We're talking about

436
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,000
The Amazon echos brains

437
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
EXA

438
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,096
We try not to say it because we don't want to set up

439
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:29,216
One day we will have access to Amazon's medical High free

440
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,800
Mancino and said they play beforehand and maybe we can get our

441
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
Our own versions bat

442
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,896
Can reverse engineering

443
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
Kevin

444
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,456
Get on that ass

445
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
Alright in other news

446
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,552
Dismiss a company that is selling Enterprise

447
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
Intelligent WiFi

448
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:51,488
Is raised 46 million dollars I really wanted to talk about this because missed is changed its

449
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:57,888
Marketing in the last probably 18 months or so and I think it's worth noting they started out actually touting

450
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
Virtual Beacon

451
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:03,008
Location basically so you could actually run their software on your access

452
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
What's your Wi-Fi access points

453
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,592
And use it software to

454
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,360
Place

455
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,200
Virtual Bluetooth beacons to interact with your employees phones

456
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:16,064
I thought it was awesome but apparently the market was not keen on this because now

457
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,112
They're touting themselves as

458
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,648
Intelligent Wi-Fi event

459
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
For the Enterprise

460
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Hyacinth

461
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,488
They're using very similar

462
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,072
Spectral analysis is how they're doing this capabilities

463
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
To say

464
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:31,680
What's wrong on your network how many devices are on your network

465
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
So they

466
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:37,056
A couple months ago or maybe a month ago announced that skill for Madam a that basically

467
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,616
You can say hey Madam a

468
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
Why is Bob smartphone

469
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
Not on the network

470
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
And it would tell you

471
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:47,040
So how many iPhones do I have

472
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,648
And the answer is more than you think

473
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
Now you know

474
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,048
So I just thought this was an interesting shift because

475
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,912
One of the things Kevin and I were disappointed about last year

476
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
As a good context

477
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
And it sounds like location is still

478
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:13,152
Not yet in there no I actually like the whole virtual Beacon idea but

479
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:17,760
Honestly I'm not hearing a lot about beacons in general it's like that technology that's like

480
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,064
It's great it's just that nobody's using it

481
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
Yeah so

482
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
We'll keep an eye on it

483
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,440
Apparently

484
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
No one else has no one else has

485
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
Welcome to our world

486
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,840
Merced news

487
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,888
Staples connect

488
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
Is finally dead

489
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,216
So Staples connect timeout

490
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,264
Cash in like 2013

491
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:44,896
I was really excited about it actually showed it one of our first conference has that we hosted his eye

492
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Happy people

493
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,992
And it was a

494
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
Zana built it

495
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:55,392
And it was a back-end platform plus a hug that connected lots of different things including

496
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,208
Smoke detectors Lutron lights

497
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
All kinds of other products

498
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,048
Nobody really bought it

499
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,888
It was actually one of the best and well design platforms out there especially for normal people

500
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
And they stop supporting it

501
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,472
You know when Zara Flint to ring

502
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,800
Staples decided to shut it down and now

503
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
It's probably

504
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,224
You can't pronounce the service at all I don't think the problem was the platform because you said it was one of the better ones around it

505
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
What's the time

506
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,064
Ain't nothing against Staples but I don't know if that was the right

507
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
Place to sell it

508
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,256
Here's a good thing

509
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,864
The fibaro smart plug is shipping this is Kevin really likes

510
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
You like it you tell

511
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:46,336
Sure sure I saw it at CVS and shared a picture on her Instagram page talking to you Attleboro folks about it

512
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,896
So it's you know it's your typical smart plug

513
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:54,784
Just takes up one Outlet you don't obviously it itself isn't outlet but it doesn't cover up the second one which is nice

514
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,856
Have a really nice LED ring around it and that is

515
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:01,184
Kind of cool because you can change the color of it you can use it as a night light

516
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,512
But you can also use it to determine how much power is coming

517
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,304
Through the outlet in a given time

518
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,864
$50

519
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,240
It's a Z-Wave Outlet if you want to spend an extra ten bucks and I probably would because this is cool

520
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,568
It has a USB port to it as well so you can charge something

521
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:22,432
And then you can monitor both the output of the outlet itself as well as the USB output

522
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,736
Pretty

523
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,088
Other news

524
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
Bixby speaker

525
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
Push to the SEC

526
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,280
Yeah they were hoping to do it in the first half of the year and then it

527
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:43,680
NWC earlier this week they announced their Galaxy S9 S9 plus and of course it's got the dedicated

528
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,520
Bixby button so they're Bixby smart speaker isn't quite ready

529
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:52,384
They're talking about approving Bixby calling a Bixby 2.0 at least internally

530
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,760
And I have a feeling that's why the smart speaker itself is pushed out because I want to improve the

531
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,344
Voice Assistant something that other companies

532
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,160
Don't you want to have a

533
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:08,000
You would want to have a $350 speaker that's not too smart

534
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,024
Just saying

535
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
There we go

536
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
All right

537
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,328
Well

538
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
I

539
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:18,496
Also I meant with her I meant I was at Bosch connected world this weekend I'm not going to talk too much about it cuz they'll be more of this in

540
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
The newsletter

541
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,616
It's cold I think the big trend for Enterprise and Industrial iot

542
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,968
Where is last year we focused a lot on security and proof of Concepts

543
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:34,368
I think this year we're going to focus more on culture and making these things actually work with your staff and how to get your staff and

544
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,160
Employees on board with it and training

545
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
That's kind of

546
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:42,304
One day take away the other big takeaway is we're going to see a lot more competition

547
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,120
As people build services so

548
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:49,728
We'll talk about it and future shows but basically I talked to bear

549
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,544
Which is both a drug company and make sex

550
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
Cultural supplies

551
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,920
And they are trying to do agriculture as a service so

552
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
Growing plants as a service

553
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
And they're building a

554
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,064
Connected weed killing machine that

555
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,112
Basically identifies weeds and kills them

556
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:10,976
It sounds like what John Deere bought when it bought a company called Blue River Technologies last year

557
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
That's because it is

558
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
Exactly the same concept

559
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,376
What's interesting to me is both companies used to work

560
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:22,240
As parts of the supply chain so John Deere sold equipment to Farmers

561
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,944
What's happening is they're both trying to offer agriculture yields as a service which means they're both going

562
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
After the same

563
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Market now

564
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,832
And we're going to see this this is just one example but we're going to see this play out

565
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
Again and again and again

566
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
With iot

567
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
So

568
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,464
Keep your eyes peeled for that it's going to be fun

569
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
And now it's time for

570
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,864
The iot podcast listener hotline

571
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656

Picture of electronic locks

573
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:55,776
Schlage electronic locks

574
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,080
No more keeping track of extra house keys

575
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,896

It now

583
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Hi Stacy and Kevin

584
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,608
My name is Christopher and I'm calling you from Broken Arrow Oklahoma

585
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
I was wondering

586
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,288
Good idea to segment all of your iot traffic in your home on to a specific SSID on your router

587
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,848
Segregating it from your computers

588
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,664
Wifi-connected TV devices

589
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,064
I'm thinking of segmenting at off onto a guest network from a security perspective but I don't want to lose functionality and

590
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,392
I think so I haven't started setting up smart home devices yet

591
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,416
But I plan to do so

592
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,440
In the near future

593
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,280
We are an apple household so my preference would be to use homekit

594
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,096
I have a router that can handle multiple guest Networks

595
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:57,216
So I can do this and still have a guest network available for my kids friends to use when they come over

596
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
I would love to hear your thoughts

597
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Oh

598
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,616
Christopher this is such a good idea

599
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,896
It's so good

600
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
And

601
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,968
I'm very concerned that you're going to get frustrated

602
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
Which is exactly what happened to me

603
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,040
I decided to try to

604
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,184
You can do this in setting it up on a guest Network and ability to have multiple guest Networks

605
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
Great so the challenge comes in

606
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
When you want your

607
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,560
Phone2action

608
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
Sni4 geofencing

609
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
If you don't

610
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,400
Care about things like that

611
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
You actually should be

612
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,104
Okay cuz the challenges your phone's going to come in and connect to your regular Network as opposed to your

613
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Gesnetwork

614
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:39,456
And in a lot of cases that can be a trigger for events to have

615
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
It's not always a tree

616
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,832
You will quickly find out what devices use it as a trigger

617
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,160
But if you're not Super King

618
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,768
It is actually possible and fairly easy to do

619
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:57,376
The challenges you won't encounter the hiccups until you

620
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,936
Get a particular device and I'm

621
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,728
Sorry to be so vague

622
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,056
I remember you went through the Senate

623
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
It did present some little

624
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:13,248
Challenges you know I I wonder about will I get my notifications can I still control all my devices from the phone and all that is around

625
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:19,392
Different networks that It's Tricky It's Tricky

626
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,696
So they were on the guest Wi-Fi network

627
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,024
Which basically turn them into when I was in my home

628
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,816
On my phone instead of being

629
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:33,472
They're my phone read it in the video doorbell extra seconds

630
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Right

631
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
Those are the kind of things where

632
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
Didn't have the time

633
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,944
Which could be fun is if you have like the nest doorbell and it ties into your

634
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
Google home thing

635
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:48,320
Or your Android Television then you might actually get

636
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:52,416
Those are all in the same local network so it's going to bypass your phone anyway

637
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,976
If that makes sense so that actually might

638
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,768
Be a way to solve for some of that wood

639
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,536
Additionally

640
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:04,192
Yeah you're going to have to really think about this to see which products talk to each other and how you want to be notified

641
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:08,544
Use these products I'm in my Android TV does get information from my nest

642
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,592
Camera they are on the same network

643
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:14,432
I don't think it would work if they're on different Networks

644
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:19,296
Right but the key is if you have your computers and phones in the phones are really

645
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
The question

646
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,208
When I have Spotify playing on my phone actually

647
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:30,560
Can see all of my Sonos has in my Amazon echos and my Google homes

648
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:34,656
It can actually cast essentially to the I know it's not casting

649
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
Another ecosystem

650
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,704
But whatever

651
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,776
If it sees all those and I can just cast it to that

652
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,824
Which I couldn't if I was on a different

653
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,152
So again it's very huge case-specific

654
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:51,808
I say give it a whirl the worst is going to happen is you're going to have a couple devices you're going to have to go through those set of processes

655
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,832
Change the SSID

656
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,624
Which you know is it fun

657
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,416
It's not the end of the world

658
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,952
Yeah and I think

659
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,744
It's a question of balancing

660
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,792
Security vs. convenience

661
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:07,424
Really can you got it that's a personal decision at that point I pretty much have everything on the same network but I do I have

662
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,472
Security concerns so that I can start late

663
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,032
Recognize the importance of Christopher's questionnaire

664
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,312
Yes we are not

665
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
It all denigrating

666
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:20,736
New we can have the ability to hop onto

667
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
Networks

668
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,040
Not sure how that would work

669
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,088
Okay

670
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
Okay

671
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Well

672
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,000

But first

707
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
Let's talk about

708
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,368
Everybody who's familiar with black jeans and things like

Pointing at cereal

710
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,416
You guys are

711
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,696
Little bit different because your text

712
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,488
What does that mean

713
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,888
We are

714
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,912

717
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,128
We have to minor illegal

718
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,176
It is really not helping us

719
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,576

00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:11,232
When is we we looked at the Block

723
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,328
It shouldn't just be like the sequential change

724
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
What are some

725
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
Ways to achieve

726
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,984
What is consensus of what is true and what is not true

727
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
An executive

728
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,056
Dad we done came up with this Dakar

729
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,552
Know every

730
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,344
Participant in an effort to execute

731
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
Participate in his validation

732
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,976
And Confirmation Transaction what is music

733
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:43,744
Iota

734
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,536
When you executed for Zaxby's

735
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
To confirm to transaction

736
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
History

737
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
Blue Datsun two transaction

738
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
Increasing

739
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,496
1

740
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,288
You have to pay no transaction fees

741
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,336
What is miso

742
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,896
That transaction

743
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,456
Because now we can truly do micropayments but

744
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,272
Scalability issue

745
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,344
Limited to the block sizes

746
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,160
To the Block in troubles what is real

747
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,256
Okay so we're going to bring some of that down because with

748
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,584
Bitcoin and other traditional blockchain Technologies

749
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,144
The more information you have the

750
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,168
Longer it takes

751
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,472
How are you need to actually valid

752
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
Cheer

753
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,688
I am saying hey if I wanted validate something I also

754
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Scepter promise

755
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
We're actually validate

756
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
Behind me

757
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,784
That's awesome

758
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,064
Right exactly

759
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
So we can look at this

760
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
Nothing

761
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,696
And everything is stopped

762
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,632
And the beautiful thing about I already said we are no longer limited to a single pipe

763
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,912
Midas a new architecture

764
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
And the main reason why are you

765
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,568
Horizontally

766
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,616
What is means that now is

767
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:14,368
Okay now I keep reading that the number of iota's out there

768
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,648
Have been set

769
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,696
And so I'm trying to understand

770
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,488
It works with the

771
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
Validation

772
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,560
Behind us in so I think there is

773
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
There's a mix of

774
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,888
What Iota supposed to be doing and

775
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,168
Cryptocurrency world

776
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,752
It's a little confusing for me

777
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,592
Reading for anyone

778
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,872
Participate

779
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Dish Network

780
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,200
What is osmosis

781
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,736
Currency that is intrinsic

782
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
What is protocol

783
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,040
Bitcoin today

784
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,600
For you to be able to transfer

785
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,440
But the thing is now the beautiful thing about this that you can utilize

786
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,048
True things

787
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
Is cryptocurrency dead

788
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,704
And if it contains data

789
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,984
Use case that comes out of that

790
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,224
Different sentence structures

791
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,784
So the children was just a way for you guys to raise money

792
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,320
Notes

793
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,112
Exit right

794
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,904
The token for us

795
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:26,304
Cuz all vision is this machine economy and what is machine economies now

796
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
Machine

797
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
Future

798
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,864
To hold

799
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,704
But the thing is now when

800
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,496
He comes to this machine

801
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,312
Participate

802
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Can contribute

803
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,104

Earning money by

805
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,688
Capitation to a car dancing

806
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
Or something like that

807
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,016
Meetup cryptocurrency

808
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,880
There's no censorship

809
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,160
Is nobody controlling it

810
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,720
Undisputed peer-to-peer pushing machine

811
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,024
But this gets into a deeper issue

812
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,072
Almost all blotchy

813
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
Chains

814
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,400
Effort out there which is

815
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,192
Are correlated so strong

816
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,008
The people are focused on the value

817
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,056
You're choking as opposed to what

818
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
You can do

819
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
Entire blocks

820

Exchanging new money streets

822
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
Everyone join two blocks

823
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,320
Images to make money

824
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,600

What's Sophia should we trust

828
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,632
What's the name of new business

829
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,216
At this point

830
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
To Pakistan

831
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,008
Circulation

832
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:40,800
Sick of it

833
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,872
Which is why we're really focused on his pregnant

834
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,664
We want to bring a Yoda ink

835
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Industry

836
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
Focus more on

837
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,016
Concept

838
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
Accomplished

839
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,344

Concrete work on a product

841
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,928
Roadmap and strategy

842
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
So we can really bring this

843
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,488
Angel production

844
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,328
Purchase are useless if there's no

845
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,376
That is true

846
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:09,216
Need something to allow machines to talk to each other and transact

847
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,752
At least information is not act

848
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,080
Talk to me about

849
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,920

I did not have problem

858
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,512
We can read it and able to secure transmission of data

859
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,816
End-to-end verifiability

860

Components for vehicle in the future sister wallet

879
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
Once a car has

880
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,167
Autonomous

881
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,215
It's not what your car can do is to Juanita

882
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,239

885
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,359
Uber like Angus place that has wallets

886
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895

Micropenis

888
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
Tesla

889
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
Will not allow me

890
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,575
With my future automated Tesla

891
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,415
Ecosystem

892
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,583
Infrastructure

PlayStation 4

894
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,655
Electricity

895
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,751
What is a very interesting

896
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,055
Focusing on is

897
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,383
Start collecting data to cancel it

898
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
Open Marketplace

899
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431

New Revenue stream

901
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479

902
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
Money

903
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,295
I love this idea

904
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,367
A lot but it also gets into this

905
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:12,511
The world seems to be with iot moving to subscription-based

906
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,327
He is very transactional base

907
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
Awesome

908
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,959
Company I don't see

909
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
I would much rather have

910
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,055
Beriberi

911
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,847
The thing is all about

912
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,407
And if there's a business model

913
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,199
Behind the motivation of data

914
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,063
What's the most efficient way to actually be able to earn money

915
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,343
And so there's always a

916
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,927
Different business

917
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
What time is it

918
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
Unleashed

What is an interesting or interesting

922
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,727
Completed

923
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,751
Now if you do micro

924
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,519
Payments

925
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,567
You can read it at the spine granularity

926
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,383
You can pay per use this unit

927
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,175
And now we're truly Edition

928
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
It because I T

929
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,295
Machines

930
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,831
That makes sense

931
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Directions

932
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,159
MTG Pirate Bar

933
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,439
Which ecosystem

934
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,839
You don't know when it's going to need

935
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,471
How long do

936
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,751
You think so we get there

937
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,775
What's a long time to move

938
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,567
Models

939
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,151
For software for example to subscription models and now

940
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,223
What you're proposing / resource unit is even more extreme

941
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,551
The question is

942
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,647
Look at the cryptocurrency song

943
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,415
Because

944
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,719
The biggest problem we have today's we are not

945
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,631
Ecosystem

946
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,167
Adoption

947
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,215
Difficult Odyssey is

948
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,335
I think of some different solution how we can actually anybody's mic

949
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
IndyCar

950
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,831
Chico

951
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,671
What's even more important that is it to rethink about what

952
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
In which areas of

953
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,975
Everybody's first adoption

954
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,279
Payments

955
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,095
When it comes to

956
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,887
Computation

957
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
Asian market places

958
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,983
That's where we going to see the person

959
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,287
I've been covering datamark

960
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,567
Play Systems Lake

961
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,615
I want to see 2008

962
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383

963
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,687
Loving day tomorrow

964
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,967
Forever

965
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
And they never happy

966
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,319
At first it was an infrastructure issue

967
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,951
Antitrust issue

968
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,095
The marketplace

969
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,399
Don't actually want to contribute their data

970
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,959
Main difficulty becomes.

971
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,495
What is date of birth

972
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,031
Bicycle

973
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,615
And nobody has been able to solve

974
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,663
Subscription services

975
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,783
But that is not really an issue for potential

976
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,599
I saw think now everything is kind of

977
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,367
Coming together right

978
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,415
2008

979
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
Git

980
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,487
ITX become United

981
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,767
Walking Dead

982
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,303
Tell me remake

983
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,583
Impossible machines

984
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,631
Collecting data in stata

985
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,655
On the market

986
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,751
Different Technologies

987
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,799
PEMDAS convergence now

988
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,823
I do think that

989
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,383
Now is the right time for a market-based establish yourself

990
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,407
But the difficulty August

991
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,943
How do you make a pot

992
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,735
Entire Industries to adopt

993
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,527
B1 bomber

994
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
Speakers

995
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,855
If you have peace pregnant

996
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,975
And that's why

997
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,767
In my opinion we as a non-profit

998
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
Supination

999
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,071
With no electric incentive other than

1000
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,935
Foster and ocean Marketplace

1001
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,703
Bring it to the mall

1002
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,263
As long as it's open source and we have

1003
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
I do think the Gnostic

1004
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,383
What about

1005
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,175
Privacy that's been

1006
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,967
Corporations against

1007
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
For a while

1008
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,391
Because it's so transparent

1009
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,183
We have some

1010
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975

Immutability

1019
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
Authorized

1020
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,087

Because we should interpret the iodine Note phone

This machine

1037
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,583
Coffee machine

1038
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,887
I need to be able to do is to sign

Boston basics

1043
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:56,319
You know I run a bunch of different gateways in my house

1044
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,879
What ones could I install

1045

How can I do this

1048
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,167
With the manufacturer

1049
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:14,751
So we want to send

1050
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,823
Toyota standard

1051
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:18,847
For example

1052
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,383
But today's Almighty

1053
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,175
So so I don't think it should be

00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,735
Songs you can run Java

1055
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,551

00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,255
Big goal right now is it

1060
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,791
Reupholster this innovation

1061
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,607
