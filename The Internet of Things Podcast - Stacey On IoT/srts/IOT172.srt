Proposed IPOs for Arlo And Sonos

00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,392

00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
Now

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,240
Let's go to a message from another one of our sponsors

32
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
Possible labs to create a new podcast series about spectacular people harnessing the power of technology for the sake of

33
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
Humanity each week they'll reveal new life changing technology and the story of how it came to be sold

34
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:45,728
Listen now to podcast not impossible to find the podcast on your favorite podcast app

35
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,776
Just searched not impossible

36
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Actually sounds

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
Yes

38
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
All right

39
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,200
Let us get started with some financial news

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
Takes out now

41
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,600
Nevermind

42
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
Okay

43
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
We have last Friday

44
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,208
Netgear's Arlo division

45
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Filed for

46
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
An IPO

47
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,048
And Sonos also

48
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
Filed for a night

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
That's an initial public offering it means they're going to raise money on the stock markets and that money will presumably go towards making their prey

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Products better

51
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Giving them

52
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
Forward and all that good stuff

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,664
The fun part about IPOs is you get to read a document called an S1

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,224
And those have all kinds of financial aid

55
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
So we know now that Sonos has sold

56
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
Over 19 million products

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,416
In almost 7 million households around the world

58
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,464
And last year they actually

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,768
Reported a billion dollars in

60
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Almost a billion

61
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,096
In income cell

62
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,632
That's actually pretty cool

63
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,936
They did have a net loss

64
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
In

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
Bisco 2017

66
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
So

67
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,824
But that's a lot of devices

68
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
Sonos has been around for

69
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
A really long time

70
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
13 years

71
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
Now there's also Arlo

72
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,272
From our lows we have figured out

73
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040
That

74
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
They have sold

75
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
7

76
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392
And they have made

77
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
In

78
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
Physical

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
2017

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,256
370 million

81
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
They don't have a

82
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
Prophet

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,984
And that is because the separation expenses to get them out from Netgear IndyGo public are costing them more money than

84
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
So they do something called pro-forma

85
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
Numbers that take out those

86
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,432
Extraordinary events and those numbers actually show that they are also proper

87
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
Which

88
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
Is pretty amazing for hard work

89
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
Incredibly proud

90
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
But hey

91
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
Yeah it certainly helps that if you look even a year before the revenue growth from 2016 to 2017 at the report

92
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,024
40 is 100% growth I mean there

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
Just gangbusters growth

94
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
Right and they are growing from a small

95
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
What is 7 million devices

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Really good

97
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
This is Arlo

98
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,288
I'm pretty impressed with that because they've only been out for just a few year

99
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
So

100
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
Coyote doing well

101
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
But

102
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
These documents are full of risk statement

103
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
And that's

104
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
3 par for the course Very

105
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
I used to read these all the time

106
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
What I'm noticing though in

107
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,648
There's a couple things to notice big trends that

108
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
Are worth

109
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
One Arlo talks

110
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,303
Quite a bit about its relationship with AWS Amazon web services

111
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,679
And that's because it's cloud is hosted on there and that's an integral part of its business Arlo make security camera

112
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Ascend

113
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
That date I get sent to the cloud

114
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
The camera footage and

115
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
The fact that Amazon

116
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,127
Now is one of their competitors is Broad

117
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,711
I'm curious because they don't talk in there about

118
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,807
Rethinking their Cloud strategy but I'm curious if they'll find their way over to

119
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,879
I guess it wouldn't be Google because Google has nest

120
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,207
So maybe Microsoft or some other cloud

121
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:51,583
Yeah it kind of does leave it to Microsoft Azure because there are no

122
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
Hardware

123
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,143
Competitors in terms of

124
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,447
Products from Microsoft in this space

125
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,031
So I wonder if we'll see that and I also think this is an interesting

126
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,847
Given the rapid m&a happening in this

127
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
Area it'll be

128
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,175
Interesting to see if other

129
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:11,551
Iot device makers decide to dump Amazon is it encroaches more and more into

130
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
The smartphone business

131
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:20,255
Text Ashley that's what I was thinking I mean right now you don't have a full Suite of competing products from Amazon but we know they

132
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,631
Several companies are two camera companies I can think of or camera component companies

133
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,679
Between blink and ring

134
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
So

135
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,519
They'll compete even heavier in the future I think with Arlo

136
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,591
Yes so that's one Trend I'm going to keep an eye on it

137
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
The next year

138
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,455
I also be surprised with Arlo they had a really tremendous emphasis on

139
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,223
Engagement

140
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Weather app

141
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,807
And they try to compare themselves to

142
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
Facebook and I don't know if this is like

143
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,903
Padding because you know you wanted

144
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,743
Investors think you're sexier than you are which is very common in these documents

145
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
But they talked about

146
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
Our spin

147
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
Monthly active users

148
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,655
And so I don't know what is your thigh feel like

149
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
I don't want to buy a device that

150
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
It wants me to engage with

151
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
Therap I want to buy a device

152
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
Performance Smart Home

153
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
Function for me I almost never want to be

154
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
Cameras are a little different

155
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
But still

156
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:14,271
Yeah I completely agree with you on trying to compare the engagement of a security camera app

157
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:19,391
To a social media app or other even they compared to Candy Crush and I'm like really you know

158
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:23,999
You go to a candy crusher go to Facebook when you make when you have some downtime right

159
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:29,887
Kind of pick and choose one that is safe for in your notifications coming in at you like I want to read this but with a camera

160
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
You may be getting a lot of notifications sooner like anytime somebody walks up to my house I get a notification it's not the

161
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
The same type of Engagement

162
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
At all

163
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
So that's just me

164
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,735
As weird I don't know if I should read more into it because usually that engagement in Social

165
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,295
Forms is too precise both users and

166
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
A potential for

167
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
Add dollars

168
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,903
Yeah and social you're engaging

169
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
Because of other people you're engaging with other people maybe not in real time maybe even real time with messenger apps that are related to

170
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,863
Direct messages are not engaging with a

171
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
Person here

172
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,471
It's not just don't see that as a comment or metric is comprable

173
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
Little weird

174
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,567
The other thing that I thought was super interesting

175
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
The Arlo

176
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
Was actually

177
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
The strength of

178
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
Retailers that they

179
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,479
Disclose so their cameras are sold

180
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
In

181
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
Three main places Best Buy Amazon and

182
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Costco

183
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,927
In 28% of their 2017 sales

184
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
What's the best

185
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Which

186
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,535
Well people are still shopping at Best Buy with my first thought

187
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,863
16% were at Amazon and 13%

188
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
Costco

189
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,935
I don't know Kevin disaster

190
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
I thought I was crazy

191
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,799
Crazy in what way cuz I actually do go to Best Buy

192
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,871
When I got to have something and or tip

193
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Piccoli it's on sale

194
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:51,807
Right so if I need something immediately I won't get from Amazon I'll go to BestBuy unless I can save a ton of money on Amazon

195
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
Best Buy would be

196
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:58,719
First and then Costco is really interesting because that is like for mainstream America that's where like

197
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,023
Your mom shops right so having

198
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
13% of their revenue

199
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
From Costco I thought was

200
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
Guys in a smart home space get your product

201
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
Good Lord

202
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:14,591
Well yeah I mean we go to Costco probably once a month and I have seen the Arlo products as well as many other electronics and it soon

203
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,687
Soon as you walk in I don't know if it's the same with every Costco but I've been to a couple in my area

204
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,247
It's like as soon as you walk in that feel like chronic sex

205
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
It's right there

206
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
You cannot not go through it

207
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
And

208
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,367
I don't have any

209
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:30,975
It's hard to just ignore and walk past it so I think they get a lot of decent sales by

210
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,279
Having products in there for mainstream

211
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
Consumers in your right what companies to get their iot products in their I have seen some others obviously but yeah

212
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Brighten your face

213
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
In your face

214
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
All right

215
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
So the only other thing that

216
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
People

217
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,615
Hash this out quite a bit and it is worth tok

218
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Talking about his friend the sonosite

219
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,223
Cuz it talk about how Amazon

220
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,319
Can pull their functionality from the Sonos 1 speakers

221
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,135
Really with limited notice to Sonos because it's an AP

222
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,743
And I looked at that and everyone's like

223
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Freak out

224
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Yeah

225
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,911
This is not great but this is something we've been living within the smart home Community forever

226
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,215
Talk about it later on

227
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Only answer a

228
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,799
He's our question but this to me

229
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Points to the need

230
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Data scheme

231
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,919
A unified data schema like alljoyn was supposed to be

232
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,759
Like ofc is supposed to be but is really not

233
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
So far

234
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
For the home

235
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,391
And for these devices because right now

236
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,743
Everything you buy is at the mercy of these supported apis and they can

237
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
They can go away

238
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,863
And they also change on a fairly regular basis as I've seen just from tinkering with

239
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Coding stuff

240
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,191
Something breaks because the API was changed

241
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,751
So I agree with you I don't know that we're going to

242
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,055
Get to that point I would love to but

243
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
Everybody seems as a run

244
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
Proprietary solution to this problem

245
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,735
Happens it's going to be terrible I mean I guess it gives a lot of negotiating

246
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Leveraged

247
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Thing like Amazon

248
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,111
I mean imagine the first time someone stands up to this people are going to knock

249
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,951
I agree with you I also think

250
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
The first

251
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
Product makers at

252
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,815
Loses compatibility for the functionality

253
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
He's going to make a big public stink

254
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,679
And blame Amazon rightly so

255
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
I don't think

256
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
Amazon will want to tarnish its

257
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
Brand with that so

258
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:24,639
When I saw this and people worrying about maybe this goes away

259
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
I make don't be silly because

260
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,759
Frankly Amazon doesn't make its money from selling Echo products

261
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
It makes money by

262
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:36,927
Getting the data building you services on that data and getting people to buy things and use the services

263
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
Through its Echo products and

264
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
3rd party Echo products

265
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
It support

266
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
The Amazon voice services so

267
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
Amazon one

268
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
Padme everywhere and

269
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,727
If other companies want to help them do that they're going to continue to support a tie

270
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
We'll see what happens

271
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,615
Inside again I want my unified data schema still okay

272
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
Let us move on

273
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
2

274
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
Amazon Prime day

275
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
Play I'm not a huge

276
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,391
Holiday it's not really a thing but we did notice

277
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,999
One remember last week when I was talking about that crazy new

278
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,559
Madam a powered sink from Delta

279
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Hey

280
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:20,959
That's actually for sale it'll be for sale to the general public for the first time as a prime day launch

281
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
For $500

282
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
4

283
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
Chrome and then

284
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
$525 for

285
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
Arctic stainless which is basically like

286
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
It looks like stainless steel

287
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,927
And if you want to see it before buying it you can actually go to the Stacey on iot YouTube channel because

288
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,743
I actually reviewed it

289
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,047
So I'll link to that review in case you

290
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
You are interested in

291
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,911
Learning more about it or just seeing one of these in action and be like

292
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,215
Wow Stacy just is a little crazy

293
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
Which is

294
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,543
So that's probably our most notable

295
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
Gadget

296
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,615
Madame Amazon

297
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,711
Products are on sale so some good deals on Kindle Paperwhite

298
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503
And I feel like I should keep asparagus

299
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
Lose them all the time the Echo Show is like

300
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
130

301
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
That's a pretty great deal

302
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
If you want that

303
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,999
And I also saw an ecobee3 with 3 sensors

304
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
Or 219

305
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,327
This is not the most recent ecobee4

306
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,423
But it's a really good thermostat and having three sensors

307
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
Is actually really stellar

308
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
I don't even know what I

309
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,335
Yeah that's actually the thermostat that we use here in the house

310
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
I have

311
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,687
Two sensors I take that back I have one remote sensor

312
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:40,063
So the unit itself is a sensor and then you can add these additional little sensors in other rooms

313
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,391
And I've literally I should really buy another sensor because what I do is

314
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,719
I put the sensor in the bedroom when we go to sleep so that way

315
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
The bedroom is comfortable

316
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
And then

317
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,583
Penny the day when I get out of bed unless another bed

318
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,399
I put the sensor in my home office I just carry it in a minute

319
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,239
Just a little stinky thing that runs on a coin cell battery in that way I'm comfortable now office

320
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
There you go

321
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
So we could get Kev

322
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
We could Splurge an annuity

323
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:07,199
Okay so those are some of the products that we saw the receipt until we saw the

324
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Tp-link

325
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:12,063
Deco mesh networks if you're in the market for a mesh Network that is also

326
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
Launching apparently is a prime daypart

327
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
Not to be outdone

328
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Buy Amazon

329
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
Google home

330
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
Is also

331
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
Doing some say

332
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Sales

333
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,143
Yeti sales are actually through walmart.com

334
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,447
And I say that specifically because you

335
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,847
Cannot go and get these deals in the Walmart store which is kind of silly I live a mile from the Walmart store but I

336
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
Order things through walmart.com just to get the rebates

337
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
And that's what they have on me so

338
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
This is through the 17th of

339
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
July which is

340
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
Coincidentally the last day of prime day

341
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
Sandy Moore there

342
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
You can get a Google home mini on sale for $34 and then you get a $15 rebate so

343
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
It's $19 net

344
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
That which is a really good price

345
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,679
If you want the full size Google home which is normal 129

346
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,727
It's on sale for 99 and there's a

347
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
$30 rebate on

348
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
Top of that so it's $69 net and if you really got to have bass booming sound for music along with you

349
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Google Assistant

350
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,503
You can get two of the big bad Google home Max units

351
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
We tried to leave Earth

352
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,343
$350 normally you can get

353
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
Two of them

354
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,439
498 after a 100

355
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,487
$50 rebate witches wow

356
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
That's too much down for me

357
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
Having one of those fills up

358
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
Yes yes

359
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
Okay

360
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,959
So pretty good little Google Assistant

361
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
It's very little but

362
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
I'm not sure what Google is trying to do here

363
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
I know we talk

364
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,663
Talked about a Google assistant voice there now 8 voices and you can

365
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:48,063
Why does he hate the man I don't know that it's so funny but I changed our Google voice to a man and he was like

366
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,791
Okay well I don't use nobody in my house uses the Google Assistant with me so I could free rein to go male or female doesn't matter but it use

367
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
Used to just choose

368
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,375
Invoice number 1 voice number to Voice number 3

369
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
The description

370
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
Now and I'm not sure I understand why

371
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,495
If you go into the update assistant app

372
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
You not use them by color

373
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
So

374
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
Yeah

375
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
Red purple green

376
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
I have mail

377
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
American

378
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
Female I don't know

379
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Sean Connery

380
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
I really don't know

381
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:24,927
But if you change it on one it's a universal change that hasn't changed at all so all of your

382
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:29,023
Assistant voices will change to the new voice on your phone and other devices Etc

383
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
What should I do

384
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
Weirded-out cuz

385
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
Right

386
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,543
Yeah so curly I use orange for what it's worth you might want Amber to green or cyan that's up to you

387
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
It's not weird

388
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
Go Google

389
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,711
Keeping it interesting

390
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,295
Is Nest aware customers can now set in manage activity Zone

391
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
What's on IOS and Android

392
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Devices

393
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,415
This is something you could do for a while with ring

394
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
And

395
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Pink's mother

396
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Camera makers

397
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,583
So I believe even on the wires I was able to

398
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,191
Yeah I know you needed the computer to do it right

399
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,823
I'm in as to where this just brings it down to the mobile apps

400
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
I have never play

401
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
I try not to but I

402
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:23,039
Once I got this news I updated my Nest app on my iPhone and

403
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
Yep you just have to

404
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,111
Give your camera in the app

405
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Make sure your

406
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,463
App is in landscape mode so if you lock it to Portrait this will not work

407
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,511
Put in landscape and then just

408
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,327
Drag little handles around the area you want so

409
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,983
Hopefully I will no longer get notified anytime somebody walks past the house across the street on the sidewalk as I have

410
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,799
Limited activity Zone not adjust our front walkway

411
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
Although

412
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
Does this mean you won't catch your neighbor if she backs

413
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,967
You know I might want to change the nest aware Zone

414
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Activism

415
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,111
Tiny tiny tiny news

416
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
You may care about

417
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
Sonos

418
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,951
Now supports AirPlay 2

419
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,511
Kevin you've got her you're a resident Sonos user

420
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:10,143
Yeah I'm not to Jazz by this but I'm sure other people will be basically yes UFC

421
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,215
Support for AirPlay to Solana update your Sonos app

422
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,287
I did that right before the show and then

423
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:22,431
When I open the app it said there's an update for the app so I can send me back to the app store which didn't have an update cuz I just got the update

424
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:28,063
Blue paint so hopefully you have better luck I was not able to test it because of that looping update issue

425
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,463
What this does is you'll be able to say Hey Siri play such-and-such on my Sonos water whatever song

426
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,047
Don't know Survivor room yet or Sonos setup enable play Apple music

427
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
That way so

428
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,191
Why I'm saying like it's not like it add Siri to the Sonos devices

429
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
It's just

430
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,055
Adding Siri support on your phone for your Sonos devices switches

431
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,383
Sure nice to have but I'll just stick with you and Madam a

432
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
And we're still waiting on updates

433
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
Is the homepod which

434
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
Oh my gosh

435
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
We bought you in December

436
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,671
Pretty darn early only when a new function comes out quite honestly

437
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:11,583
I'm it's just because it's limited to Apple music which we do subscribe to but I also listen to The Beatles Channel or

438
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,935
Are the coffee shop or coffee house rather on Sirius XM that's all supported by Madame a

439
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,471
So why have that card

440
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
Okay

441
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
Hey let's talk about something really cool

442
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
Space base

443
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
Iot

444
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
Not to be confused with

445
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
The space force

446
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
This is real and

447
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
Happening well sorta

448
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
Kevin you want to talk to us about space

449
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:37,439
Space coyote I did not know about this but apparently there's been a project going back to 2014 with the

450
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
Development of cul-de-sac

451
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,023
Which was low cost

452
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
Machine-to-machine communication services

453
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
Space-based infrastructure for iot

454
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
The deal is this is actually spinning to terrestrial iot using the satellites to communicate and then go

455
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
Actually have

456
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,871
2 billion low power

457
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
Wide area network

458
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,991
Devices connected to Satellites by 2022

459
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
I have written about satellites

460
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
A lot

461
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,087
It's a weird sub-genre that I

462
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
I am really excited about

463
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,927
The challenge with us and answer we don't have answers

464
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,023
When you're looking at this kind of satellite stuff you need to think about it

465
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,839
Things you need to think about simultaneous connections

466
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,375
Because satellites

467
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
This one actually

468
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Handel's billions

469
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
I believe so it's a lie

470
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,031
You also need to think about

471
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,591
The cost of the radios in the terrestrial

472
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Devices to

473
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
Talk to space and their battery

474
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Consumption

475
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,735
As you can imagine shouting all the way out to space is

476
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Battery intensive

477
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,551
That's one of the reasons why these satellite

478
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
They're huge and

479
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
Expensive

480
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,159
About two batteries and very expensive radios cuz

481
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
There's not a lot of use for them

482
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,999
Rights of operations

483
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
Xiaomi scale

484
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
But

485
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:53,215
This actually sounds really interesting so I'm actually going to try to find somebody who can talk to us a little bit more about this because

486
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:57,567
It would be really intriguing to have these would use the same frequency is sick box

487
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,175
I'm all about new networks for iot in

488
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
Having a space camp

489
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
Pegasus Global coverage and waited

490
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
We don't have today

491
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,343
And it gives Elon Musk another use for space

492
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
Yes

493
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
All right

494
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
Smart City news

495
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
So

496
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
LG CNS which is a

497
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Iot

498
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
Division of algae

499
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
Stepmonster a new

500
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
Smart City platform

501
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
Called City Hall

502
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
And

503
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,263
It's going to focus on Korea

504
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
Or maybe not.

505
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,359
Which is where they're based

506
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
And it basically is a way to

507
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Collective

508
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
From iot sensors Oliver

509
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,599
The place and bring it in and analyze it

510
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
Deliver services

511
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
So

512
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,439
It supports the

513
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,231
1 M to M Stan

514
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,559
As well as 98 other iot standard

515
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,887
Yeah there's a lot well that means they're doing all the standards

516
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
For you the downside is

517
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
That you're stuck

518
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
As long as you.

519
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,079
Got yourself sew-in ideas the platform will serve as the Unified

520
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
Takata control tower

521
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
4 smart cities

522
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,967
This feels very similar to some things I can do saint

523
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
Also in South

524
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
Korea they have a similar

525
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Effort by 1

526
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
Carriers

527
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,879
Singapore has it ever

528
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
For like this day forth with

529
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
I believe it is Accenture

530
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720
I'm a

531
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,280
Connected City platform that pulls out all the state and and

532
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
So I don't know

533
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
Just throwing it out there

534
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
There for you guys

535
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:30,496
Yeah that one M2M standard I probably should have heard of it before but I never did so I went and looked

536
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:36,384
And they're tons and tons of white papers and standards documents there and I looked at the security one would win

537
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
211 pages

538
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,248
And my brain exploded as I can even look at the other standards

539
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
Apparently it is

540
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,832
Aquatica worldwide global

541
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
M2M standard

542
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,416
If it is I'm not sure why I hadn't heard of it before

543
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,232
About my global

544
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,816
Maybe it is if you're in Europe

545
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,120
Europe I believe Sutton Asia

546
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Which skin out

547
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,448
Is what we would call arrested for Elder row but

548
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
Everyone else would be like

549
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
Yeah that's global

550
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,824
Global can just sometimes meme

551
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
More than

552
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
And before we get it

553
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,944
Sucked into the

554
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
One M2M standard

555
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
Let us talk about something Kevin

556
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,880
Which might be useful to you guys especially if you heard me talking about the aware air quality

557
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,904
Sensor

558
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
Couple weeks back

559
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
This is how to make your own

560
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
Indoor air quality

561
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,072
Yeah I just found this right before the show so I can't type

562
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:33,216
Follow this project and everything you know about allegedly this works fine basically somebody ate a fruit has

563
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,032
Put their own air monitoring sensor

564
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Together

565
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,640
Measure various particle sizes and temperature

566
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:46,528
Relative humidity there using a dust sensor module temperature humidity sensor a little

567
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:52,928
Whatscall hackable board hack a b l e as in Bluetooth low-energy so that's how they're getting the data moving around

568
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:57,280
Around using a Raspberry Pi as a Gateway with the python script python

569
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,352
And a Taproot dashboard display so they can

570
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:06,752
Look at the data again it's a project that I did not do pretty technical onto because everything is explained what does

571
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Sex a good thing

572
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,104
Infinity chest want to follow the directions and copy the code

573
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,664
You could do this I would imagine it's knocking

574
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:20,320
After that much I didn't look at the pricing but this has to be Camping World modern dollars that we spend shock is more than 50 Cortana

575
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
This looks like

576
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
They say this is a

577
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
Beginner level

578
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Project fi

579
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
Folks interested in Bluetooth

580
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
So

581
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
You know

582
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
I'm looking at this sound like

583
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
Code you can download

584
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,936
How you know if really good

585
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,752
I probably wouldn't do this I would spend $99 on a

586
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
Device but

587
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
If you're fun project for anybody

588
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,128
Nevada high school students

589
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,408
Bored this summer

590
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,688
Tell him to go yeah

591
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,248
I think looking at the instructions it's overwhelming because

592
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:55,648
All the base details of how the sensors work down to you know the different bite in a transaction in

593
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,304
The dust sensor for example is listed but that's good for people who want to know everything about it but if you don't you could just follow me

594
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,376
It's a little less overwhelming if you look at that way

595
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
Yeah and I would say

596
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:12,288
Indoor air quality sensor running around it's actually really big deal and

597
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
There's a lot of

598
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,872
It's kind of interesting to see like how certain

599
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
Products are

600
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,688
Use patterns in my home

601
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,712
I'm really affect the air

602
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,504
So we started using it

603
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,064
Downdraft for oven because I saw this

604
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,344
Every time I cooked

605
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
We just get like all the

606
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
Does particulate matter

607
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,440
Hey dude I should totally

608
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
Suck that way and so now we do

609
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,816
Using like an oil diffuser can really suddenly like spike your

610
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
Pollutants inside so

611
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
Maybe don't do that

612
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,192
So I don't know what I found a very educational

613
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,104
Yeah just a Bluetooth sensor by itself is $20 I mean again this is not going to be a huge investment in terms of cos

614
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
Okay

615
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,944
So let us go to this week's voice mail

616
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,480

629
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
Smarter homes

630
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
Start with

631
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
Schlage

632
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,248
So this week's voicemail is from

633
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
Josh

634
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,856
I like your podcast by the way thank you

635
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,136
My name is

636
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,440
I have a Chamberlain

637
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,744
Garage door opener that I'd like to make

638
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,072
Smart MyQ enabled and mostly interested in

639
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
Daniel Tiger

640
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,400
Open garage without closing it

641
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,192
Gainesville close it remotely

642
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,496
Sorry I looked at the MyQ add-on

643
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:50,592
Cannot big fan of all the limitations if you wanted if this then that

644
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
Description if you want to add Google Now.

645
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
Description

646
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,760
No matter what I'm assuming that we'll have a subscription to ever get it

647
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
I want to

648
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,344
To look at other options but I think

649
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,648
Conflicting information online and working on a TV

650
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Coffee

651
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
God

652
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Anything else

653
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
Put the Chamberlain

654
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,744
Do you know anything about

655
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,584
Whether third parties work with Chamberlain garage door openers do you know any of them

656
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Good

657
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
Thank you very much bye

658
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
KJ

659
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
This is

660
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
There's a lot easier

661
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,264
Because it's a SmartPhone question

662
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,336
Haha yeah because there's no unified data schema for smartphone

663
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,664
Most of the other garage door

664
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,736
Don't actually want you to be able to open

665
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,552
Boise State security

666
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,624
Issue so this is the same thing that happened in the lock

667
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,208
Community a couple lock makers now that you do it if you also give them a

668
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488
A passcode verbally

669
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
So that's

670
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,792
Aspect

671
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
Why

672
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
It doesn't work

673
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:50,496
I do have the Chamberlain MyQ I think it's a great option for people who just want to see if their doors open or shut

674
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Take care of her

675
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,824
Remotely so I gave this to my in-laws

676
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:58,176
For someone who wants to get more into home automation

677
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,224
There's only a couple things I can offer for

678
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,040
One is if you have a wink

679
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,344
It does work with the wink hub

680
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,648
Not to remotely close it

681
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:13,280
Use like opening it as a trigger so I have a robot in my wink that

682
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,328
If we open the garage door after search

683
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
Time of

684
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
Night after

685
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Basically.

686
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
My porch lights go

687
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
So

688
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,240
I did that without if I did that without having to

689
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
Subscription

690
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,800
So if all you want to do is use it like

691
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
What is a trigger

692
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
But

693
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
If you want to go further

694
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
You're probably going to go with something

695
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,432
Kevin

696
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,272
Yes I actually don't have a Chamberlain MyQ

697
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
Garage door opener

698
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:40,160
When I did put in with my garage door opener may work with

699
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,952
Myql explain in a second

700
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,256
So it goes by several names

701
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,072
When is the linear gd00z

702
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,888
The garage door opener the one that I bought I think

703
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:54,240
It's available at Lowe's for like $65 under the name gocontrol which is

704
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,800
What I have to again if the same thing as just rebranded

705
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,848
Essentially it's a Z-Wave

706
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
Controller

707
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,688
With two wires and those two wires get attached

708
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
2D

709
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,808
Terminals where the wires from a hardware button garage door

710
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
Open and close

711
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,880
Ghost so I attached the

712
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,464
Go control to that and it works perfectly fine with wink

713
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,072
There's also a tilt sensor in the kid that you put on the garage door and based on the tilt

714
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,376
Controller tells me if my garage doors open or closed

715
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:27,264
So I too have a robot that if after 10 or 15 minutes the garage doors open it lets me know

716
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,288
Via wings

717
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,592
And then I can remotely close it via wink

718
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,152
Now the MyQ models

719
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:38,272
According to the maker of the module the Z-Wave module they say they are not compatible

720
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,880
That seems to be true based on what I read in various forms and such

721
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:47,744
However we can add a link in the show notes if you don't mind soldering

722
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280
Little Liars

723
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,072
To the hardware

724
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,632
Controller in your garage that you likely have

725
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
If you want to do that

726
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,192
You can make it work

727
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,520
You can't solder it directly or connected directly to the MyQ

728
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
Like I've done with

729
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,824
My garage door opener

730
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
That will not work

731
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:08,992
Additionally if you're not on wink and you're on SmartThings it looks like SmartThings support has been pulled

732
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,784
In the last 6 to 12 months

733
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,320
Buy Chamberlain so you

734
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,112
Really out of luck if you have a SmartThings

735
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
City of wink

736
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,696
You got an option but it's going to require some solder

737
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
And our final thing

738
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
Have not tried this

739
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
But we did find it

740
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
A device from

741
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,424
Comedy called nexx garage nexx

742
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Garage

743
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,008
And they have a $99

744
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,336
Module that you stick to your door and a sensor

745
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
And

746
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,920
This actually they say it works with Madam a

747
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
So

748
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,992
And it also works with Google Assistant

749
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
And if

750
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
So

751
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,624
That might be the way to go I looked at the reviews

752
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,952
Some people it looks like it's a little bit more complicated install

753
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
But

754
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:57,120
I don't know this looks yeah there's no really good solution here if you don't want to jump into the MyQ space because of

755
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:02,752
These changes that Chamberlain has made an adding subscription fees for if this and that and so on

756
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:07,616
I don't know like I get why they do it and I know we talked about in the Shogun Steel just not a fan of that

757
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:08,896
And

758
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,968
Just before you buy if you're interested in the next garage thing

759
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,016
Before you buy just go to the website which is

760
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,552
Next garage.com

761
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,088
They have a list of the

762
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,136
Garage door openers it works with so

763
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,440
Chamberlain Bunches of them I don't know

764
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
At which one you have

765
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
So you will have

766
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
How to check that out

767
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
All right

768
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:30,656
Josh I hope that helps you and you enjoy your tinkering to get your garage doing

769
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
What it

770
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
Wants to do let us know

771
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
What you ended up

772
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
It how you feel

773
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
And now

774
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,336
Stay tuned for our guest this week

775
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,152
Who is Randy Schneider from Delta faucet

776
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,480
Talking about how they connected the faucet why

777
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
And

778
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:49,600
A bit about how they programmed it to understand words like

779
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,416
Decanter and glass + Tumblr

780
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,208
So stay tuned for that

781
00:30:54,464 --> 00:31:00,608
And now a message for this week sponsor hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things

782
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:05,984
That's for a message from our sponsor sponsor is a pharaoh and I have Joe bread

783
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,520
CEO of the Pharaoh here to

784
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,568
What's really quickly

785
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
Tell our audience

786
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,616
What is a pharaoh

787
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,408
Fully integrated

788
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
Fully Interactive

789
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,248
Fully secure sensor to Cloud iot black

790
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
Our customers choose us

791
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
Because they can

792
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,368
Market buys much as 80%

793
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,648
Of course that cuts down on

794
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
Cost and complexity

795
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:30,304
Because it's so robust and they can reuse 90% of their work

796
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
Project project

797
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,912
First love how easy it is to get their devices connected

798
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,216
And how fast and responsive they operate

799
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,288
Awesome so Kenmore use as a pharaoh to get its appliances

800
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
What are the benefits

801
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,920
The Kenmore as seen from connecting fridges and dishwashers to the internet

802
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456
Are two main category

803
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:52,064
That's the first one is in customer value in customers get value features

804
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,624
Amiability to control their devices from their smartphone

805
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,672
But also they can integrate Kenmore

806
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,440
More tightly

807
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
Traditional lives

808
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,744
Kenworth

809
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,536
Because their product managers

810
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,096
Appliances with cruelly competitor

811
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
Differentiation

812
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,680
And devices that are easier and less costly

813
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,264
Maintenance service and they use real data from these devices

814
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,824
The field to understand what features are popular

815
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:23,040
Kenmore is an incredibly strong and trusted brand and they had the foresight to start very early to lead what was at the

816
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,088
Time an emergent connected appliances

817
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
They had multiple projects

818
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,696
With existing solutions that they just weren't doing the job

819
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,232
It took him too long to get a Kinect

820
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
The place to Market

821
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,304
Experience too many outages

822
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,376
Generally the solution

823
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
Runner 27

824
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,032
Connected Appliance model together now

825
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,336
And a pharaoh is a true platform

826
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,896
So everything works with everything else

827
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,432
What are the hardest things about eyes

828
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
Is that you have to

829
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
Develop for embedded

830
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,576
Mobile and the cloud but a pharaoh has created a unified

831
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,112
Click the configure developer

832
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,904
The process that radically simple

833
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,440
And as a result

834
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,488
The first pharaoh powered Appliance

835
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,304
The Kenmore built

836
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
The previous one

837
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,168
The outages that used to experience stop cold

838
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,264
Because we built a lot of resilience into the system

839
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
Device if nobody connect

840
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
And too many company

841
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,616
Go through all the trouble

842
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,944
Justifying the customers aren't signing up

843
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,504
Because the onboarding process is too complicated

844
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
To fly with a pharaoh

845
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,064
It's a very simple

846
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,112
Process started to see

847
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,136
A lot more customer

848
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
Actually connect me

849
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,232
Appliances and then once those appliances were connected

850
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,560
Manage the entire fleet of them

851
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,864
Using an overall single-pane dashboard

852
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,656
Let's see the data that

853
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,192
It's coming back from their machines

854
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,520
Topline analytics and machine learning

855
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,056
Finally I want to touch on

856
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,360
Security a pharaoh not only secures all the

857
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
Potato Patch

858
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
Devices or appliances in this case in a cloud

859
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,016
But it also secures the manufacturing process

860
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
Where can we go

861
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,600
The best place

862
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
Is a pharaoh

863
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
Dot IO

865
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:08,000
That's a f e r o.

Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast this is your home

868
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,920
Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Randy Schneider who is a product

869
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
Electrical engineer

870
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
Delta

871
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
Hi Randy how are you doing

872
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,576
ICC I'm good thanks for having me on the show

873
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
I'm super excited

874
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
To have you here

875
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,024
We are talking about my new favorite Gadget

876
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,048
Which is the

877
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,120
There's a lot of words here but it's basically a Delta faucet

878
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
That talks

879
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,168
To madame

880
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,008
Call Amazon

Assistant

882
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
Play so we don't set up

883
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,640
Let's get this started with I saw this

884
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,408
CES

885
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
I could talk about it ever since

886
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
Very excited

887
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,272
How did it come to pass that you guys

888
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,600
Hey

889
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,880
Text hubby and

890
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,904
How did madame

891
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,720
Yes that's a great question are

892
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,000
Joshua Fawcett

893
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,792
Turn around for almost 10 years

894
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:18,400
And adults are always looking for ways to innovate and add new technology to our devices

895
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,984
So where the invention really of Amazon Echo and

896
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,824
Other smart speakers even ableist add voice activation

897
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,104
To some of our devices

898
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,152
So we wanted to look for ways

899
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:34,016
We could add it on to existing product offering and bars are electronic

900
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:37,856
Arabic seller so adding voice activation made sense

901
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:42,720
People could do some of the tasks that they normally do with a touch faucet but this house when able

902
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
New features

903
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,280
Express base

904
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,352
I guess we should probably explain to people what the touch

905
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,936
Yes sir I said she'll faucets use

906
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
Cast of Simpsons

907
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
Technology so that you can touch

908
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,568
Deposit anywhere to turn it on and off you has a handle on it so you can

909
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:01,920
Install control temperature and then you can even touch the handle to turn it on or off or on the spout

910
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
Enable you to do tasks

911
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:07,808
Very good and as someone who's owned I have had a capacitive touch faucet

912
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,856
Ever since we moved into this house

913
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,904
And it took that it was a little bit of

914
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,720
You guys but I would never never go back

915
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,768
Now even though every now and then

916
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,304
Oh my God

917
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
Turn it off

918
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,864
Turn off the faucet at the faucet

919
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,656
Supposed to

920
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,448
It's actually a lot like

921
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Smart light bulbs

922
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,544
So you guys actually started selling this

923
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
First through you

924
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Website

925
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,896
Two people as part of a beta program

926
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
What kind of feedback

927
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
Yasso

928
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,016
This year we sold a small quantity to some user

929
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,064
And we

930
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,112
Lots of interesting feedback really

931
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
Learn about use cases in which

932
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,672
People use this

933
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
I got some

934
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,488
Good feedback about a week

935
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
A teacher features

936
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,328
Product stories as well about a person

937
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,096
Has a cat

938
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,888
Lights to turn a faucet off so they

939
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,984
And they would give it to me and then your voice

940
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Turn off

941
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,776
I like it

942
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
Imaginext cat

943
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
Okay and I noticed you guys don't have it

944
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,896
And I was kind of curious

945
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
Why that way

946
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,968
Yes that's a great question and

947
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,784
It's actually an intentional decision that we made

948
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,600
With the testing center on voice activation

949
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,416
Pretty much all of the user interface is through voice actor

950
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,232
So there wasn't a lot left 4 and 1/2

951
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,536
Necessary

952
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:26,912
Customer first and customization options could get a user interface to customize

953
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
The name of a container

954
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,264
Core 2 processor remote control faucet

955
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,848
Also as updates are pushed out

956
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,152
Something that we learned at you

957
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:42,528
Get the updates right away to the web app you don't have to worry about are you running the latest version of the app on your phone

958
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
So that was a nice

959
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,904
Have you seen any pushback from your customers about this or do they even

960
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,184
Never use the web app

961
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,744
Yes will you does a question me specifically asked are you

962
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
The weather

963
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,840
You should just minimal because most season her case is to voice

964
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,632
But it does have some music

965
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:04,032
Features you can check to see how much water are you using and then like I mentioned you can customize some things like the name of the cancer

966
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,592
Inner Light coffee pot or dog bowl

967
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,640
And how much water goes into those containers

968
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,456
Let's go to the actual installation

969
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
So

970
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,016
There's a lot to think about

971
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,808
Once you got to deal with

972
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,856
I mess with everything in my house and

973
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,416
But it wasn't actually that hard

974
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,720
H2O faucet

975
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,280
Man of a module

976
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,560
And they have to have

977
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
Power underneath

978
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,144
And that's because Wi-Fi is a big Power hog

979
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
Capacitive touch

980
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,680
Did not have

981
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
What's a little bit of an adjustment

982
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,264
I'm glad that I had another

983
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
Do most

984
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,920
So yeah you're right Stacy with the Wi-Fi module on the faucet you have to have an AC adapter

985
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:47,552
Turn Outlet we have found the majority people have an outlet and they may not know that they have an outlet Austin times together garbage

986
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,344
Disposal under sink

987
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,136
Or if you have a dishwasher nearby

988
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,928
There be an outlet under the sink as well

989
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
And if you don't

990
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,768
Typically an inexpensive addition

991
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,840
Electrician come out or if you're DIY type person

992
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
You cannot live without

993
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,400
Okay

994
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,936
And let's talk about

995
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,704
The actual

996
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
Skill with

997
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,032
Because I find it a little bit

998
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
To be like the way this work

999
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,616
I will say

1000
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
Madam

1001
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,664
Acid altitude

1002
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
Dispense

1003
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,968
Types of water and

1004
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,784
But I do find myself stumbling

1005
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,832
Over

1006
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,880
So I'm curious about

1007
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
How you employ

1008
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,000
Yes I can be a little bit of a mouthful.

1009
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,816
Once you get used to it and the routine it

1010
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
Becomes

1011
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
A place for you

1012
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,680
But it's something we're looking to improve right now it's

1013
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,984
A limitation of the

1014
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
Profiles that are available

1015
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
Within

1016
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,896
Ecosystem so they have profiles for light switches and door locks

1017
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,456
But there's not really a profile for a faucet

1018
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,992
And that's something we're working

1019
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,272
Consumers Amazon

1020
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
2

1021
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,576
It's that next stage of development

1022
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
Oh yes okay that my

1023
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
Makes a lot of sense

1024
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,256
It's kind of gets into this challenge that I see in which is there's no data schema I know Universal data schema

1025
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
Smart Home

1026
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,304
In devices in it

1027
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,864
So everybody has to build their own

1028
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,424
And if native skills basically in bed

1029
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,264
I would think becomes a challenge for a company like you guys especially

1030
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,408
Do you have plans to go beyond anatomy and moving to like Google or some other ecosystem

1031
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,200
When we start our development

1032
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:19,968
We

1033
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,504
Took a step back and looked at

1034
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,576
The landscape to figure out what's assistance out there and what we see

1035
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,856
Systems are people using

1036
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,416
This goes back sometime maybe year ago and

1037
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,232
Looking around we saw the Amazon Echo was

1038
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,304
Can we erase a little bit and was popular

1039
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,096
Consumers

1040
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,632
Would also buy a touch faucet

1041
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,240
Partners Amazon and wanted to make bar

1042
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
Voice activated faucet

1043
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,544
Works

1044
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,568
Within their skills

1045
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,104
Available since then

1046
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
Pulaski exchange a little bit

1047
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
So

1048
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
Google has

1049
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
Come up

1050
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,248
Apple has their homepod

1051
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,064
And I think those are both platforms we are looking ticks

1052
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
Blur to try

1053
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,648
To add voice activation

1054
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,672
To our faucet

1055
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,952
Work with those platform

1056
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,488
We're just not quite there yet

1057
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:09,376
Let's talk about this issue that a faucet is something that people don't necessarily think a lot about

1058
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,192
I like when you move into a new home

1059
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
Has a faucet

1060
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
There's a bus at great

1061
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,312
There wasn't one

1062
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,128
But people don't necessarily spend a lot of time

1063
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
Upgrade cycle

1064
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,736
But I imagine that you guys do

1065
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:30,624
So how long do you feel like your boss it should last and then how long from when you start adding technology to

1066
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
How does that change that occur

1067
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:38,048
Yes people will typically think of a faucet has an appliance when they move into a new home it is

1068
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
Just something that they use

1069
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,376
People replace a faucet

1070
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,168
Is something goes wrong and

1071
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:46,752
Copulate or they want to do a remodel and update

1072
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,776
Stylist

1073
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312
I saw sister design

1074
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,895
And they have lifetime warranty on their

1075
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,943
Are electronic faucet

1076
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,223
Have a 5 year warranty

1077
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
You can

1078
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
Expectantly

1079
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
On time

1080
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
After the electronic Spark

1081
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,623
Where's outer brakes

1082
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,927
Maybe there's an upgrade cycle that needs

1083
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,719
How do you envision that

1084
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,583
Telesis Electronic Component that needs to be replaced we offer replacement parts

1085
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,863
You can definitely reach out

1086
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,679
Delta to an 800 number or an online

1087
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,495
Contact and we can send you a new part if you need that

1088
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
One of the

1089
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,799
Biggest questions that I've got

1090
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
People about the

1091
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,615
Beyond

1092
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:28,735
How do I know that the faucet isn't going to be turned on in Waist gallons of Honey gallons

1093
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,295
Water so most people were sitting here telling

1094
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,087
Oh I need a notification system

1095
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,647
Dispense this many gallons of water

1096
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
I don't actually know do you guys have some

1097
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
So

1098
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,023
Kohler touch faucet

1099
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,583
Actually have a 4 minute timeout

1100
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,447
And so that will override not only a touch activation but also a voice

1101
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,239
So typical flow rates

1102
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
People's homes are

1103
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,079
About a gallon and a half per minute what means

1104
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,895
Really worst case scenario if somehow your faucet

1105
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
Catalan

1106
00:42:59,455 --> 00:42:59,967
Distance about

1107
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,247
Water

1108
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,063
Okay I couldn't even fill up my fish tank without you

1109
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:04,831
You guys

1110
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,647
Another issue that we've encountered

1111
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,671
A couple times

1112
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:12,767
I think it's probably was Madame SOI only there was some sensitivity around

1113
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,071
So I started out calling

1114
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
Something

1115
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
Fish bass

1116
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,423
Because I have a certain base I like to fill

1117
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,471
It's forever that I used to film

1118
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
I tried to do that

1119
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,567
Was not having any

1120
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,615
But she's like I couldn't understand this

1121
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,895
So do you have any advice

1122
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
Are people on

1123
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,455
Hey baby don't call it

1124
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,735
Fish bait

1125
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,527
Just call it bass or something else

1126
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
Yasso

1127
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,831
One-word names

1128
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
Definitely work

1129
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,903
Better you can use more than one word

1130
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,695
You know Amazon has their own

1131
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:47,071
Machine learning that's going on in the background and interesting to do during development when

1132
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:53,215
We have to train are still on what kinds of objects looks or will you provide a list of

1133
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,751
Common object names

1134
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,031
Star Developers

1135
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,615
Actually went to The Crate & Barrel website and got a list of a lot of different

1136
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
Akinator names

1137
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,919
Anywhere from Facebook

1138
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,455
Decanter

1139
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
Kind of

1140
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,783
Train it on types of object

1141
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
An object name

1142
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,575
Cold water

1143
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
And so

1144
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,391
The scale uses that information

1145
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,415
2

1146
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,439
Trey cross reference

1147
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,975
I name you might have with

1148
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,279
Common name for container that hold water

1149
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,303
I like that

1150
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:21,375
Are you guys planning to expand this to other areas

1151
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,703
I think this is awesome but a lot of people are like

1152
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,263
Hey I want to be like Madame a run me a bath

1153
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,311
You know that's something we're looking to

1154
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:33,151
For we right now have the voice activated kitchen faucet

1155
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,967
And it would be an area that seems to make sense

1156
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:40,063
To explore as we continue to grow the offering but right now is

1157
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
Justice

1158
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,879
And what is the price you

1159
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,183
About launching this product and how people

1160
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,463
So far

1161
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,559
What was most surprising was how people use it in their everyday

1162
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,375
The once people get used to

1163
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
Naming an object

1164
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,423
Like

1165
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,471
They begin to use it

1166
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,543
Tilly's Chillicothe / se have abs

1167
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,079
Secret recipe that they make

1168
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,383
For me it's making oatmeal for my son

1169
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
In the morning

1170
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
Assertive change my

1171
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:13,855
Routine in the morning instead of reaching for a measuring cup out of the cupboard I think a voice command and feel confident it's going to depend

1172
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,927
Right amount of water into the bowl with oatmeal and then

1173
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
X-ray to go

1174
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487
So it's

1175
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,791
That kind of learned behavior that

1176
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,815
You see the shift

1177
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,143
Four people were doing things one way and now the technology enables

1178
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
How to do it anyway

1179
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,751
Okay well I can't wait for the future when madam

1180
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,775
Myrecipes

1181
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,079
Dispenser automatic

1182
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,615
Well I'm off doing

1183
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,151
That's going to be like

1184
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:37,919
My uncle

1185
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,687
Randy

1186
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,967
Thank you so much for

1187
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
