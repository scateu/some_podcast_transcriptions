00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,032
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast I am your host

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,056
Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,592
And here is your co-host

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,688
And I'm recording the show from the Sonny &

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:23,296
Get still foggy confines of San Francisco where I am at Intel's developer forum

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,320
And Kevin

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,344
Where are you today

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:30,464
I am not at IDs I am in hot muggy Southeastern Pennsylvania

10
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,000
That's a real shame

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,024
San Francisco

12
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,096
I love it there

13
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,120
Awesome

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,144
Okay so

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,216
This week we've got a couple things to talk to you about we've got

16
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,264
Google's brand new

17
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,824
Actually I should say newly discovered

18
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,104
Operating system

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,872
Fuchsia

20
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,896
We got

21
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
Intel's iot strategy

22
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:57,088
I got a question about robots and we're going to do a review on my Brita pitcher that refills at

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,368
The Amazon

24
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,648
Replenishment program

25
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,696
We also have our guest is

26
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:05,536
A woman most of you guys probably know as lawyer Liz on Twitter is

27
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,560
Liz Wharton

28
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,888
And she's going to talk about some of the legal aspects of the internet

29
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
Things

30
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
But first we need to do a word from our sponsor looking for ways to keep your designs a step ahead of your

31
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
Predators learn the latest in iot in embedded systems design at this year's arm techcon in Santa Clara California

32
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
Three days of technical talks Keynotes and Exhibits begin October 25th at the Santa Clara Convention Center here in sites

33
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
Turn leading-edge designers in iot embedded software Graphics silicon design and networking Advanced registry

34
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
October 14th to register for arm techcon 2016 visit arm techcon. Com

35
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:48,032
Today on October 25th through the 27th now back to our show Kevin

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
Let's see

37
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,384
I think we should hit the fuchsia stuff first so we can get your disclosure out of the

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,224
The way what do you think I think that would be wise since we're going to talk about some

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,272
Newly discovered Google

40
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,624
Efforts I do work for Google I do not work on

41
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:09,024
Anyting development-related so I don't have direct knowledge or any impact of what we can talk about

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
But I'm happy to share my thoughts on what's been reporting what's been found

43
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
There we goes

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
Last week it looks like some

45
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,728
Or maybe it was earlier this week time flies when you're traveling

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
People discovered

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
The Google heaven

48
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
Dropping some code into GitHub

49
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
And

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
The phrase that they

51
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,712
Hit Upon was pink plus purple

52
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
Equals fuchsia

53
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
A new operating system

54
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
And so

55
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
The best article

56
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,624
We found so far is from the Android Authority

57
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,696
Who actually took the code and started running it

58
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
And they discovered

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
Couple things

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,608
The big thing about fuchsia is that it uses the little kernel

61
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
Okay

62
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,192
And magenta LK is a really tiny OS

63
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,240
I'm for embedded devices sothink

64
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,056
How small should we think it's an artist's right

65
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,360
I would say that's accurate

66
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
Okay

67
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,176
It looks like an artist

68
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
Which is

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,808
Is a real-time operating system designed to run on

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
Really tiny

71
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,904
Memory Footprints in really tiny battery

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
Powered usually devices

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay

74
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
And

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
There is also a

76
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:19,680
It says on an embedded arm platform the core of LK is typically just 15 to 20 KGB

77
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
That's crazy

78
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
That's really small

79
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,544
Crazy smoke crazy tiny so we're talking

80
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
So magenta

81
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Is bigger

82
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
It could

83
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
Even require gigabytes of memory

84
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
Don't know

85
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,320
Allow something at peripherals

86
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,160
And it looks like if I'm looking at this and I asked your opinion

87
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
It looks like Google has built

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
An operating system that could span

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
All the things from

90
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
Little tiny

91
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,656
Embedded devices all the way up to mobile 2

92
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
Computing

93
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
Does that feel right

94
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,800
That feels right that's what it looks like you know he's got

95
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:01,920
Google's built-in Stone Colonel which is interesting because Google has Bill price on the Linux kernel

96
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
Such as Android in Chrome for

97
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,528
And they're very obviously very popular

98
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Used throughout the world

99
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
Is a small kernel like as you said

100
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,952
Decadron on something very very small and I'm looking actually on

101
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,047
The GitHub right now where there's documentation from Google and explains

102
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
Bok

103
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
Colonel Kush

104
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:27,007
Clearance small systems with limited Ram a fixator for a real Sandy bounded set of tasks

105
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
So

106
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,383
Small devices single-purpose devices perhaps maybe sensors who knows

107
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,711
Certainly I would think that's a good fit for iot type devices

108
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,759
Magenta the other hand

109
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,575
Could I get them ready traffic from GitHub stock notation

110
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:46,207
Target's modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors non-tribal events Ram

111
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,047
With arbitrary preference during open-ended computation so

112
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
That way

113
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,911
Resume scaling up to Everyday devices that we use

114
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
So

115
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,495
You don't based on that I think your tribulations

116
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
Sounds good for now

117
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,335
But so let's let's think about this

118
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
Why does Google need

119
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,431
A new iOS like I mean it does need

120
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,479
They've talked about

121
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
Google had launched

122
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:17,695
Was it nest with weave and thread but Google had something that was also we've and there was another one

123
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Hello

124
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
So

125
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
That looks like it might be kind of

126
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,423
NOS an artisan NOS for the in

127
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
Thanks so

128
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
I'm kind of like will cash where does this fit in with that

129
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,359
Going a step further with

130
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:40,479
With that thought I mean the whole Brillo thread weaved it was very IRT specific

131
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:47,391
And could not I would think scale up to running regular say consumer or business devices

132
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,207
Where is what I'm reading here on

133
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
This combination of Elkay magenta

134
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,655
AKA fuchsia would actually run on the smallest of

135
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,471
Devices all have two usable devices that we

136
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
Carry around

137
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:07,871
But you wouldn't necessarily I mean Brillo supposed to be Googled OS for iot devices on

138
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
With microprocessors

139
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
So

140
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
Is confusing

141
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
Inlets

142
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,343
Rillo actually I'm looking at some of the data from

143
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Google

144
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
IO event

145
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,743
Brillo devices need a minimum of 35 make

146
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
That's it for today

147
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
Yeah so that's like a

148
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,703
Alright that's not the kind of thing

149
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Yeah that is not

150
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Okay

151
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
Well gosh I feel a little bit more

152
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,103
Confused I'm glad I know this is out here

153
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,175
I would love to have some sort of unifying code Bayside

154
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
I can think of advantages to that

155
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
I'm any other thoughts you have Kevin

156
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
Something else I noticed from

157
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,159
What gender is hard to get in actually anybody could use any of our listeners could go to get heaven

158
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,487
Build fuchsia and run it themselves at and its current state

159
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
Because it is open source

160
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,583
I noticed when they ran

161
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,631
And got it running rather got the build running

162
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
There were some included apps

163
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,799
And all of them were written with dart which is Google's language introduced

164
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,103
How to say about 2ish years ago

165
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,151
How to be kind of like a JavaScript

166
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
Type of

167
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
Platform I know you can

168
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,575
Cross compile Dart apps into JavaScript so there's definitely

169
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,623
Are some some similarities there

170
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,487
What is that mean I don't know does it mean everything for fuchsia will be written in dark

171
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,887
Don't know this is early days so I think we're mentioned since there are very few major dark

172
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
Limitations out there

173
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,495
Relatively speaking compared to Java Java script and songs

174
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
Yes and it's listening

175
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
Where is hainan

176
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,687
A scale of one of the advantages of Dart is it super scalable is my understand

177
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
I I do not

178
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
Code so I do not

179
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
Cold and dark

180
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
Or anything else

181
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,671
I know that was a big deal for Google

182
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:01,791
In a big deal why they use at sew-in we do definitely need Super scalable languages for

183
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,351
IRT if we're talking about billions of devices

184
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
So

185
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,447
I don't no big mystery a big fuchsia mystery

186
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
We will

187
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,519
Wait to see what's up

188
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
So

189
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,335
Next cool story is

190
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Intel

191
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,919
Here I am an idea Finn I was actually

192
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:24,319
A little disappointed in some of the stuff that I saw a round I wanted to see more cool

193
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,903
Iot things from them but the two big announcements that

194
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,975
Have the most impact the first is that

195
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,839
Intel has taken an armed license so it can manufacture

196
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
Arm chips

197
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,655
Hell hath frozen over

198
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
That's

199
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Without

200
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
I love this

201
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:49,407
Yeah this is I think this is great because I mean Intel has been trying to crack the

202
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
Low power

203
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
Mobile market

204
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:56,319
Superchips for a long time ever since they saw a scale 10 years ago or whatever it was

205
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
And McDonald

206
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:02,975
A decent job with their atom processors and I would have had surgery and some other things

207
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Clarks

208
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,583
Now if I'm reading this right and you were you're there so you can

209
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
Tell me if I'm wrong but my first take was

210
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:15,519
Wow if I'm a Qualcomm or a Samsung who is an arm licensee building chips for mobile devices

211
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
I'm a little worried because now I got a

212
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
Big competitor building

213
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
The same types of chips

214
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,479
Yes so if I were Samsung

215
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,807
I would especially worried because Apple probably

216
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
Looks at this and it's like

217
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Oh

218
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Hey

219
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,487
We need These Arm based processor cuz they're my phone chips in our base

220
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
Processor that

221
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
I don't know what a word

222
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,959
Is Samsung is one of their manufacturing Partners For That

223
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
Chip-in

224
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,799
They've had some back

225
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,335
Can 4th in the past over

226
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
How

227
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,407
They're working together when they were

228
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
To each other so

229
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
I would say that

230
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
This is great news

231
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,087
It also makes a lot of sense strategically

232
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
From Intel

233
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
Because it's

234
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,999
I mean they tried was Sophia and Adam

235
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,583
Printer just cut it they shut it down

236
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
That's fine

237
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
In what

238
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,935
This shows us is it until ripe

239
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,775
I think it shows is that Intel's willing to let the 50 billion devices

240
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
They're on the very edge of the network

241
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Have

242
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
Whatever let arm have that

243
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:31,039
The ESPYs on those are pretty small Intel's not a fan of that style of selling

244
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:37,951
And then what they're going to do is the Gateway boxes at those those Edge devices talk to that's going to be in in

245
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
Intel inside

246
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
When you look at their Network

247
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
Working strategy

248
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,119
They are building boxes for

249
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
Carriers

250
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
With software-defined networking basically carriers

251
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
Can put in

252
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,311
Like instead of this proprietary Cisco and Erickson gear they can put in like

253
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,151
Intel-based servers that run all of the core networking

254
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Concussion

255
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,991
Even has a radio Access Network

256
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
So I ran

257
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Kind of chip

258
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,719
Effort I don't know how well that's going to go but they do have it and then all of that data get sent up to the cloud wear

259
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
Once again we've got you

260
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
Xeon Processor

261
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:19,423
I think it's very pragmatic of Intel to do this and it gets I think it's a smart move

262
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,775
They've sunk literally billions of dollars in losses

263
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,823
Trying to crack the mobile market

264
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,431
And the kind of signal they were getting away from that about a year ago or so and and now they

265
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
At this point

266
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
Monkey with arm that's fine

267
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
But

268
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,599
Let's be a part of it anyway at least in the chip manufacturing process

269
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
And they have to

270
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Intellicast

271
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,511
Billions of dollars in their Fabs they spent billions manufacturing it

272
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,327
Freezy tiny nanometer levels like

273
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
Just ridiculous

274
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
This is a lot of money and now

275
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,519
Making their own ships couldn't fill up

276
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
The capacity they have

277
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
With PCS on the

278
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
ISO

279
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:06,015
Investing billions in in these fantasies

280
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,343
You know it's just not smart so now they changed

281
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Model

282
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,183
So I'm loving it I'm feeling really good about it

283
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
Now that they bought the butter

284
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
Github nervana systems I think it was last week

285
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Week or two weeks ago

286
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,911
And that's a really interesting machine learning platform that uses gpus

287
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
So

288
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,031
When you start looking this it feels like Intel's getting to this point where they're like you know what

289
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
X86 is good for some things but

290
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
Maybe we're going to open up the world

291
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,199
Kind of again he'll have Frozen

292
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,063
Kind of reminds me of Microsoft's changing point of view over the last two years as well

293
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,879
Oh that's a good analogy yes you just

294
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,207
But if it makes sense you have to change in this world or

295
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
You just go Absol

296
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Nobody wants to be

297
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
Obsolete

298
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
Okay so here's a question for you Kevin

299
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
And our audience

300
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Aruba

301
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
Part of the iot

302
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
Might guy

303
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,103
I mean there's a lot of ways to answer that it's a pretty open question but my gut is absolutely just based on

304
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,175
Sensor data that they can capture and communicate

305
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
I would say rather that yes

306
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
All right

307
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,063
Good then we can talk about Intel's other really cool announcement

308
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,671
And this is something I could sound like robots really open us up to a lot of cool stuff

309
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
They're definitely quote-unquote a thing

310
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
Pretty loose definition

311
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
But until

312
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Project Euclid

313
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,935
So this is a realsense module so this is there

314
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
Computer vision

315
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
Sensor kind of effort

316
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
What did you just say created a

317
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,615
People are calling a candy bar sized it's

318
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,151
It's probably smaller than America

319
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
Actually

320
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
And this has a camera

321
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
It has

322
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,575
Accelerometers it has all kinds of stuff in it

323
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,415
What's really cool is it has this embedded development environment

324
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:55,071
You can come by and see me with an IDE and you can program with our Arduino or turtlebot

325
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
Witcher 2 robotic Frameworks

326
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
And you can like

327
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Literally

328
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Quick

329
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,751
Skills that you want this

330
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Euclid

331
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,079
Device to enable

332
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
And then

333
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,431
You can build like a little apps on it and like 22nd

334
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
It's ridiculously cool

335
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,551
This isn't going to come out until the first quarter of 2017

336
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
We have no pricing

337
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
And

338
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,927
It's it's just this little stick and if you

339
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Put it

340
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,279
You can put one in and create this like tiny little robot that follows you around

341
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
I I like the idea of using it

342
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
Discreet liquor

343
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
Suitcase that follows

344
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Syllabi

345
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
So

346
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
I asked about battery life they said they have been running it

347
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
For about 45 hours straight

348
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
On like a little robot

349
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
Easy robot

350
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
Fatso

351
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
Again that's not a

352
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,135
So I think it's another example of

353
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,207
Until being pragmatic because they've had their real sense

354
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
Hardware out in fact I think

355
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
What are the Dell

356
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,119
Tablets had real Santa's running on an Intel chip

357
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,935
I was an Android tablet and you can use it to

358
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,495
Capture sensor data Dex from

359
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,543
Intestines in San Juan

360
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
There wasn't very many

361
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:16,735
Could a permutation of it except for very specific use cases maybe you know you're on the field as a construction worker

362
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
You need an exact measurement or something

363
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,367
This is a whole new Twist on the Developers

364
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
Hands and said

365
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
Here take us see what you can do with it

366
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,999
And let's build some apps quickly which

367
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
Pictures to see what people come up with

368
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Me too

369
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
We'll have to wait

370
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
It's in developers hands

371
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
So you know what's

372
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,751
Eyes open I think someone's using it

373
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
Since B

374
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,103
There's a robot that does Inventory management

375
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
It does this

376
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
It runs along

377
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
Shelves in stores

378
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
And

379
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
It

380
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
Season

381
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Figures out

382
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
If the shelves are stocked

383
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:59,487
After beads people spending 8 hours every night going around with barcode scanners and scanning inventory retail store

384
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,023
Assistant to do all that to me

385
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,559
I think that's a great use case

386
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
See although it does eliminate

387
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,959
People and that's actually been an undercurrent that I've heard a couple times here is

388
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,263
You know a lot of these things are going to take

389
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,567
Very menial jobs

390
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
So

391
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:19,967
We should we should never say robots eliminate people made jobs

392
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
You're right

393
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
I'm sorry

394
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
DARPA

395
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
They have something

396
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Big Dogs 2

397
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Unrelated note

398
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
This reminds me a lot of what

399
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,935
Project Tango is for Google only I haven't seen very much too in a way there limitation there either

400
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,239
But it's the same concept of

401
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,031
Sensors and so on I haven't

402
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,847
Heard any about Tango being put in robots and slash play

403
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,663
It's interesting that we got two major players

404
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,503
Going down this path let's see what they do the same what they do is different

405
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:59,903
Yes we will keep our eyes on that and I'm sure someone a Google has probably put Tango in a row but I'm sure people are Google put

406
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
All kinds of crazy things on robots

407
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
Okay

408
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,327
Let's go because we are a little pressed for time let's go to The Brita

409
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Review

410
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,215
This is the Brita Infinity water pitcher it is wifi-enabled

411
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
It is tied to the Amazon Dash

412
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:20,127
Replenishment service in for $45 you get what is basically

413
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
It's a nice-looking Brita water pitcher

414
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,783
That tracks how much water you're running through the little Brita filter and then went in

415
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
You've run

416
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,463
More than 36 gallons of water in the pills the filters now compromised it will order a new one

417
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
Automatically

418
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,607
So I told you guys about this I did make one statement that wasn't quite true there is

419
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,167
So what's an inside of it is

420
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,263
A little module that's inside the lid inside that module is basically

421
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
Wi-Fi

422
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,359
And a sensor that says go the lids open

423
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,687
Are closed there's no ultrasonic sensor nothing that's measuring water level

424
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,759
It's basically every time you flip open the picture to fill it

425
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
Accounts that is

426
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,111
Smart

427
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:06,207
Counter so to speak it's not really monitoring how much water goes through the filter

428
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
Yes so I would

429
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,655
Quest to make this is like accurate as possible I did

430
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,215
Everytime I filled the picture it puts about

431
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,495
4 cups of water in

432
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,543
There's about 16 cups

433
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
Of water

434
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,127
Can a gallon so keep that in mind as I tell you what happened

435
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
So about

436
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
30

437
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
Loads in

438
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,271
So 30 times that I had refilled it

439
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
All of a sudden it went from

440
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
Hey you're good

441
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
2

442
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,183
Crap it's time to order another filter you

443
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
Views 36 gallon

444
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
Lono

445
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,351
So I was like yeah that's kind of wait no I have not

446
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,399
I have not used anywhere close to that

447
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,031
The filter at like the the lid open a while to let the water filter through

448
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
Ask the

449
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,127
Pretty guys if that made a difference

450
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,479
If they had any experience of people leaving it open and it kind of

451
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
Messing with the counter

452
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
And causing some

453
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,367
Causing it to blink jump ahead and they said no

454
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
So

455
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,023
I'm not sure what happened the ordering process was nice in the sense that you do get an email from

456
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
Vim Amazon

457
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
It says hey

458
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,887
Cheer picture just called in a Brita filter order

459
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
You got 24 hours to cancel

460
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
So

461
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
I didn't cancel it cuz I

462
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,335
Wanted to see the whole thing through so I didn't cancel it in

463
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:32,735
You know two days later a Brita filter arrived to my door I still hadn't gone through the next 4 gallons

464
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
Between 36 and 40 is when it

465
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
Send out the

466
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
Help sidebar filters

467
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,415
It over 40 it starts

468
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
Blinking red and saying

469
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
So

470
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,559
I did just get to the red that was after another

471
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
30

472
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Phil's

473
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,423
Exodus 28 pills

474
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
So

475
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:57,055
I don't really know what to make of this the fact that you could cancel it and you can reset it

476
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,127
But I just kind of was like

477
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,175
This is not a win for me

478
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
And I'm not sure what happened

479
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,991
I wish I could know

480
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,807
It doesn't sound as smart as it

481
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,599
Cooter should be to me

482
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
Yes right if it's just

483
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
Counting

484
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,231
They say that the top being open and close

485
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:19,839
And assuming that you're filling up with xcalar next cups every single time

486
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
It's kind of like

487
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,495
They do tell you have to fill it every time to the max fill line

488
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,823
Which I complain about earlier I was like that is super hard to see

489
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
Black on black

490
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,895
It's a glossy black so you're like I hate

491
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
The other thing is I had to

492
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,039
Like sign in Via an app and register it and all of that

493
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,367
And I'm never going to use the app again but I was like

494
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
Know the process of

495
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,951
Opening an app to connect a water pitcher

496
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,023
It felt like if you can't manage your Brita water filter

497
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,071
With the stickers or just a sense of

498
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,119
It's three months or my water now tastes funny

499
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,167
I think it's probably a better way

500
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,983
Yeah I mean you could you could get a

501
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Just a little

502
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
Counter app

503
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,591
Every time you fill it and get the plus one on

504
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
Monger that way yourself

505
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,199
You know it be accurate than at least try

506
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,855
It doesn't seem like it said in value for the automatic process because the automatic process does not

507
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
Sound accurate

508
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,440
That makes sense does not sound that well

509
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,232
In my experience it was not a cure

510
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,816
I will say though if you open it real fast and close it like

511
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
It doesn't count those

512
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,472
There's a visible flash on

513
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,752
The top when it's like

514
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,800
I have registered this as I feel

515
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,128
So that's that's a little nicer but still

516
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,432
That is my impression of The Brita Infinity

517
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
Wi-Fi

518
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
Connect a picture

519
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
We don't need that in our lives

520
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,296
It's not providing a useful enough

521
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,576
Function I would say

522
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,112
Not in its current state

523
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,208
How many Alamo from pruvit

524
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,536
Consideration

525
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,816
If it became a

526
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
Accurate

527
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,864
A Brita water

528
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
Picture is like 30 bucks

529
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
So

530
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,240
Jennifer $15 more it's not like a

531
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Raising

532
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,080
I mean it is 50% more I guess so

533
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
Sky crazy I don't know

534
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
Your mileage may vary on the

535
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
1 guys

536
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
All right

537
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
Well

538
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:15,552
That is it for this portion of the show please stay tuned for our guest

539
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,600
Who is going to talk about

540
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,160
I know you guys are so excited to hear about you was

541
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,440
Terms of services

542
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,256
But we actually do have a good time talking about

543
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,840
Legal implications for company selling iot devices

544
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:34,496
And how soon we as consumers can expect data privacy laws or something to change

545
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:41,152
Everyone this is Stacy breaking into the iot podcast with a big month

546
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,456
Developer conference for people making the internet

547
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Things happen

548
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:50,624
Is annual conference in September brings together technologist and designers who build core infrastructure for iot plug

549
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,720
Happy that you'll see two days of expert speakers including me

550
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,304

I have like two weeks in a row that we're going to have people who are at Defcon here but

574
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,352
I should also mention if you like

575
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:10,752
What Liz has to say you should check her out on her own radio show which is buzz off with lawyer lives at America's web radio

576
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
All right

577
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
So all of our

578
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,384
Marketing and exciting stuff out of the way let's get

579
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
Right into it

580
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
You

581
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,992
Are both a contract attorney

582
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:26,880
And dealing with all kinds of other things with the IRT and you're also really involved in this community and have been for

583
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:32,000
A decade so let's go with what you think the most important issue is

584
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
Companies today

585
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
Who are trying to embrace the intern

586
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,912
Infrasonic thank you for

587
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,728
Invited me onto the show today and for

588
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,288
Mentioning the buzz off show but

589
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,336
How many zits

590
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,152
Really getting them to wake up

591
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
Fence Pekin

592
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
Realize

593
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
That

594
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,272
Well everything is connected

595
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,320
That opens up

596
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:00,416
All kind of issues that they would have never had to

597
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,464
Look at Ford Imports

598
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,072
Upgrading the software on different devices patching

599
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
That

600
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:12,192
There are risks of now your network is exposed

601
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,472
3D devices

602
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:17,568
That the convenience factor and you're great

603
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,896
Connections with everything in the

604
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,480
Internet of Things by the same time there additional risk

605
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,832
Hidden Easter eggs hidden traps

606
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,952
So you and your last shower most recent show said

607
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,512
Used actually Delta and their recent

608
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,096
Crazy all of their computer systems

609
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,376
As an example of

610
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
I have one of these things

611
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,168
Do you want to explain that

612
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
Thanks it

613
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,008
Become one of those

614
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
Things where

615
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,360
Delta hide one thing went wrong

616
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
And

617
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,920
Where you would have been

618
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,968
Back-to-back ups and

619
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
Stale face

620
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,784
All of those failed as well

621
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
And

622
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,880
It serves as a good reminder

623
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:08,768
What happens when everything is connected and you're relying on one

624
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
That you need

625
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
To have

626
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
Segmentation

627
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
That

628
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:19,008
It with your home network if you're bringing your work laptop home connecting on

629
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,312
And it's the same network

630
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,360
That you're running your

631
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664
Netflix account

632
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,968
The Rays that your coffee maker

633
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,784
That your printer is running through that

634
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,112
When one of those systems

635
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,672
Is or can be compromised

636
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,720
Impact all of that

637
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
And

638
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,816
Setting up at it really just setting up those separate

639
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,168
Okay so yes I talked to the security people in the past or like

640
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
You should have

641
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,752
Separate networks one for your

642
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,288
Security system

643
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,688
One for your work stuff and then to computer switch

644
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:04,320
Hawthorne heavy depending on where you're how you're carrying them around exactly

645
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
So

646
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:10,464
This is also a but this is a good point because Target actually had when they had their massive

647
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,280
Data breach of their point of sale systems

648
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,840
The people came in through the hpac system

649
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
Which

650
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
You know how to become connect

651
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
So that's that's a good thing to remember

652
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:25,312
Will from the legal standpoint to you as a lawyer and he does come out and play

653
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
You're now at risk

654
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,872
Yes

655
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,432
You're not because you're aware that

656
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,272
That's happened to other so now that everyone

657
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
Noah's battle Target was breached

658
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
That's how

659
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,440
Different companies have similarly suffered

660
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
Their data breaches

661
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,024
Do you then have a duty

662
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,328
Two pizzas for cautions

663
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
At the very least

664
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,936
In your office that you can't control necessary the environment

665
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
Outside of your office

666
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
But

667
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
Just a reminder that

668
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,592
Has it created

669
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,896
Legal liability if you're not

670
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,968
So speaking of legal liability

671
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
I have a question for

672
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,784
For you cuz this is something

673
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
I think

674
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,600
It's going to be a bigger issue soon

675
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
So right now we with our connect

676
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Two devices

677
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,208
We tend to

678
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,768
Buy device put it in our house download the app

679
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,560
Click on a terms of service agreement

680
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
Arrow that says

681
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:25,472
It this explodes or if this does something leaks my data nobody's responsible

682
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
Arbitration

683
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
So I do not

684
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,080
But as I

685
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,664
Some of these devices like maybe my car or a security system

686
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
Really feels like

687
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,992
There's this other legal regime

688
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,040
Where people are responsible

689
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:45,440
Take the people making products are responsible for building things safely and securely so they don't kill you are we going to get

690
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,024
Get to a point where these two regions Collide and

691
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,304
How is that going to be media

692
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:55,168
If you already have an entire new anytime you turn on the TV

693
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,496
Depending on if it's late at night you get that

694
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,288
Commercials

695
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,592
Have you been injured by this product

696
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,408
There is an entire product liability

697
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,712
Legal Market

698
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
Universe

699
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,016
And

700
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,808
Dot is

701
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,368
Starting to bleed into

702
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,696
The direction you're absolutely right it's just

703
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
Federal Trade Commission

704
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
FTC

705
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,352
That FDA are looking at

706
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
All of these

707
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,936
Device isn't saying no no no no no

708
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
You have

709
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,752
Some basic

710
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
Duty

711
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,920
To create something that you know isn't broken it at all that you can't escape that liability

712
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
Bye

713
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,736
Including that in your eulogy

714
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
Clean out your terms of service

715
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,600
Ear drainage especially with people don't have the opportunity

716
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,624
Negotiate.

717
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
It's

718
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:53,536
Take it or leave it but same time there you had a basic duty to create something that you knew it was broken

719
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
Or want you to come to where you have to recall

720
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
Okay

721
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:02,752
Actually came out a couple weeks ago with this kind of concept

722
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,032
It was after the nest

723
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,104
Issue were Nest pulled the revolved

724
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,688
The people that purchased in basically just shut the whole thing

725
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,528
Think down the FTC looked at that and they cleared them

726
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:20,928
But they did write this blog post that talked about guy she'd are you selling a device are you selling a service how do you how are you

727
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
You guys marketing these

728
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
Products

729
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,048
I bought for you because I think it's

730
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
It's going to be a big issue

731
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:31,168
It depends on what we're talking about if we're talking about

732
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
A device

733
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,776
Failure for example you're seeing at some of the card

734
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,568
That is fair

735
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
On board

736
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
Systems are there

737
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
Systems fail

738
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,736
That was different than is usually what we could match work

739
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,528
You got multiple components

740
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
And you're seeing

741
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,648
FTC and FCC

742
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,976
Waiting into privacy issues as well

743
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
And

744
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,608
This two agencies are really trying to figure out

745
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
Who gets to control that then if it's

746
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,704
The device that

747
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
Feeling

748
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
Then

749
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
That I need to Trade Commission

750
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
Is it

751
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
The

752
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,920
Information that's being communicated

753
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
The data

754
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,736
Aurrera service

755
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,064
Connecting through being broadcaster

756
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
Through the internet

757
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,440
That's where you're seeing the fight between the two

758
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,488
Ever have to get to set the rules

759
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
And

760
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,840
I don't see it clearing up any time soon when you're talking about

761
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
Budget

762
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
And

763
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,936
Really a 40 cuz everyone wants

764
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
To have the final say

765
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,776
Because with the final stage of the bigger budget

766
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
Bright

767
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,360
How is a consumer

768
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:48,224
Do you think this will affect me let's go out 2 years the idea of

769
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:55,392
Product safety and what I'm signing what kind of Rights I'm signing away do you think that will change within the next

770
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
2 years

771
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,720
I think it will change

772
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
I don't know

773
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,328
The vehicle through which it will have changed

774
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,144
I didn't volunteer regulation or a lawsuit

775
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,680
Exactly

776
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
Then

777
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,544
Tongue and cheek joke

778
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,568
That

779
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,592
We met

780
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
When

781
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
I'm chatting with

782
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,480
Some of the Regulators on issues with drones

783
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
Is

784
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
Well

785
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,856
It's going to be the lawyers and the insurers who drive the chain

786
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,648
Because

787
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:34,048
As soon as something goes wrong an inch are going to have to deal with whether they're going to cover it what defense of the

788
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,864
Operation as soon as they're paying money out of pocket

789
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,632
And then

790
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,936
Unfortunately the lawyers

791
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:43,776
I'm going to jump in and say well we have

792
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,056
Quiet your injured

793
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:48,384
Order representing the interesting

794
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
This is your own fault

795
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,736
How will we hear you didn't text. So

796
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
The Warriors

797
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
The insurers

798
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,648
And through that will either push the regulators

799
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:03,744
To address it if it doesn't get fixed AR or the manufacturers

800
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:08,096
You're seeing in the automobile industry there is some

801
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,912
Slow movement with the

802
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
Auto manufacturers

803
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,264
Being willing to put in place

804
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
Certain

805
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,872
Checks and balances of system pictures how to report

806
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,688
Here's how we're going to do our six-year-old development

807
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,760
But that's taking years to get there

808
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:29,600
And all they've really done is just put out proposals

809
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,880
You haven't seen it

810
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,672
Surfing in Palma de chat so

811
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,208
2 years out

812
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,560
Is it going to be different I just don't know how through one of those mechanisms

813
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,864
Yeah I can imagine a law getting passed

814
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,168
10 to years

815
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,008
Okay

816
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:50,848
You mention drones and I know that's a special area that you focus on

817
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
And you were telling me

818
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,224
Just the act of flying drones and starting to collect data

819
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:01,088
We could probably I don't know if we could you can tell me can we play that two sensors like

820
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
How to clean sensors around

821
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,720
That opens up this whole area of

822
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,768
Legal responsibilities that

823
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
Udo municipalities

824
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:15,936
Normal citizens may be news organizations they just start thinking about that so

825
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,496
Any kind of talk about some of those legal issues that

826
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
You know might open up

827
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,592
Between drones and all the sensors

828
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,640
Collecting a lot of

829
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
Data

830
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
That you don't

831
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Think about

832
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:31,296
And with that data it has value to

833
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,368
Nefarious actors are just other parties

834
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,672
And suddenly you're having to look at

835
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,952
Your

836
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,488
Cyber security

837
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,792
Liability policies because

838
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,840
You're downloading that data

839
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,376
Maybe you're deleting it

840
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
But

841
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
.

842
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,984
Because of right target environment

843
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Or

844
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,080
If you're collecting personal and pii

845
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
And you're storing it

846
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
And somebody

847
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,456
Lease a laptop in their car

848
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
Suddenly

849
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,064
You're having to deal with a breach whereas

850
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,368
Before you were flying does

851
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,208
Aircraft are using a sensors you didn't have to worry about some of that

852
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,488
Okay so

853
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,560
Bigger surface area that you may not even be aware of

854
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,912
Is one of the issues and what about let's let's talk about pii because

855
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:23,520
What I think people are starting to become aware of is that really means nothing

856
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,824
Because as you get more data about

857
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,592
People

858
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,664
You can actually drive who they are

859
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,456
In create pii

860
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
From

861
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,296
Maybe a few data points that aren't protected under the

862
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112
Exactly

863
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
One of the other

864
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,976
Probably if you have enough information that perhaps

865
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,768
Isn't considered as you

866
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,096
Noted in a considered pii onto itself

867
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
Because you don't have that other

868
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:53,216
Breaking that you can go on someone's Facebook on their Twitter feed

869
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,032
On any of their social media accounts

870
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,848
And collect the rest of it

871
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,128
You saw that with

872
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,456
Does my first seven jobs

873
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,016
Oh I glad about that yeah

874
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
You just

875
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:11,136
Told everyone perhaps if you've answered your security questions correctly

876
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,440
Or didn't create

877
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,232
Creative answers

878
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,048
Wow now I have enough said

879
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,328
Get into your

880
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
Financial account

881
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,936
I'm glad I did not do that

882
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,264
I also make up completely random answer

883
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,288
Answers to my security

884
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
Does Batman

885
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
But sometimes

886
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:36,224
Well it's a much better practice that I certainly recommend to folks but yes

887
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,784
I do I have stopped myself Madea time

888
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,856
What did I think my first concert at 10

889
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,440
Okay

890
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,768
And if your

891
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,584
You mentioned insurance policies

892
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,376
I'd love to ask you about

893
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
Contract

894
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,424
Because by Guy

895
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,032
Wendy's companies

896
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
This day.

897
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,360
A lot of them are working with others

898
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,408
You know I'm using this data to

899
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,712
Serve people or maybe they're just using it

900
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,248
Their own purposes

901
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:15,136
How are you seeing companies negotiate things like sharing data to deliver in and service

902
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,720
Are you sober part of Indie HIPAA

903
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,488
World

904
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,024
You had the hitech ACT

905
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,072
Which when it went into effect

906
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,888
Required at extended

907
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,680
Liability to

908
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,960
Business associate

909
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,288
So then there's your Contracting with

910
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
You're now responsible

911
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,896
Agreed to make sure that there

912
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,224
Taking necessary and

913
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,272
Appropriate precautions to protect it

914
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
Save

915
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,648
While not required throughout the entire business world

916
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
At the same time

917
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,720
If you do

918
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:56,608
If your data is breached through someone that you're working with at the very least negatively impact

919
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,888
Your reputation

920
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,680
And in a world where

921
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,776
If something goes wrong it can be instantly communicated

922
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,056
Nevermind

923
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,592
Hashtag

924
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:10,176
Deltadentalmn do you have to build that into contracts and

925
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,480
Companies are having to take a closer look at

926
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,016
Okay what are you doing

927
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,296
You can't just

928
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,320
Check a box

929
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,136
What to talk about before I give you this day.

930
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,696
How you're protecting it and

931
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,232
Are you taking us

932
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,768
Basic precautions

933
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,328
The likely answer is no

934
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,632
What would your advice be to companies

935
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,960
Who are trying to negotiate

936
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,752
Kind of connected devices

937
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,568
Interoffice may be brought in by employees

938
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,408
Versus connected devices that they bring in on behalf of their and

939
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
Employees

940
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,040
Take me back to that segmentation

941
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,648
Having different networks set up to it if I'm bringing my

942
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,184
Cell phone

943
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
From home

944
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:55,744
Dad

945
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,280
You're limiting

946
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,352
What data and what information what network

947
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,632
It can access

948
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,912
And on the flip side

949
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,008
I don't need to use my company laptop or my company computer

950
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,288
Oshkosh

951
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,360
Everything that I would want to from my personal devices

952
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,456
Into creating their segmentations and just being aware that

953
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,016
When you're bringing in a printer

954
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
That's going to be Wireless

955
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
Rate

956
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,624
But it needs to

957
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,440
I hate that you're used to have

958
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,720
Anything cricket

959
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,304
Take these precautions just as you would with every other device

960
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,632
Okay well since we circled back that's probably a good place to

961
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,960
To say thank you so much for coming on the show this week Liz

962
