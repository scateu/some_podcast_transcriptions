Kevin tofel

6
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:25,088
And we have an awesome show for you today it's a little shorter than usual but we're good we talking about nvidia's new Edgecomb

7
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:25,856
Computing platform

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,672
Sony's new low-power wide area network

9
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,488
Another option for those of you looking for a job

10
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,536
And

11
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,328
Some updates on news from

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352
Amazon

13
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,120
Apple

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:37,888
And

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,936
A new law that could use

16
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,960
Some smart things

17
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,776
Plus we're going to have as our guests this week

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,824
Jerome Grand Hotel

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,456
Who is the CEO of Eve and he is actually going to give us a big update on all things

20
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,480
Homekit

21
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,528
And a bit about Eve

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
Itself

23
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:59,136
And we'll also hear from our sponsor Dell Technologies

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,464
So let's kick this show off with

25
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,024
A message from another one of our sponsors

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,816
Nordic semiconductor

27
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:10,656
Are you planning to build a product using cellular iot technology

28
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
Chicopee nrf91 60 the most advanced multimode cellular iot

29
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,848
Device on the market today

30
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,688
It supports the two cellular standards for iot applications

31
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
Lte-m narrow band iot it also supports up to 15 LTE bands making

32
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
And a true global

33
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,672
Compatible cellular iot solution

34
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:38,048
Also has on chip GPS making it ideal for asset tracking and monitoring

35
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:44,192
Application power and security comes in the form of arms latest cortex m33 CPU

36
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,336
And Arm trustzone Security and 1GB Flash in 256 gigabytes of RAM

37
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:55,712
They're integrated RF front-end and adaptive power management on the S I P

38
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,112
The NRF 9160 is your first consideration when designing cellular iot Prada

39
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,976
Find out more at ww.w. Nordic semi. Com

40
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
Slash 9160

41
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,400
Okay Kevin let's kick this off with some industrial action

42
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
Nvidia at

43
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
Computech

44
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,264
I can't believe computex is still happen

45
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
It's crazy so

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,384
So Nvidia has this new egx

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Platform

48
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
4

49
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
Machine learning at the edge and this is not a surprise for me because Nvidia has been selling their Jets and Nana

50
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,928
Processors which are very that's their smallest version of the processor

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,024
They've been selling cards that support this in the industrial iot for

52
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,328
Few years now they actually just launched a

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,376
Machine learning support for that

54
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
I'm single stick

55
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Which is pretty cool

56
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
But I talked to Lots

57
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
The people who are using this

58
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,920
In a server or on a dongle at the edge of their industrial Network to manage like to understand it

59
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,968
A perform predictive modeling

60
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
Or to do

61
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
Computer vision

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
So these are all very popular use cases that are already happening

63
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,416
So this is basically saying hey

64
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,440
BECU customer

65
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,744
We know you want this so what we're doing

66
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,328
Is we're going to create this platform and it's a set of software and Driver

67
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Chris is going to run

68
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
All the way across several

69
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
Leadership so it will include the Jetson

70
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,752
And it will move all the way up to

71
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:28,128
Micro Data Center so you can have a rack of Nvidia T4 based servers

72
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,176
Sticker do 10 trillion operation

73
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Is per second

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
That are running this song

75
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,320
This is good news for anybody who's basically trying to do

76
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,136
Lots of machine learning at the edge and

77
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,184
People who are trying to process a lot

78
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
In

79
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
Many of you guys might be like

80
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,840
Why is this even necessary but I still talk to people who are like we're not putting our

81
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
Very valuable data up

82
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,704
We don't want any of that being trained there we don't want to be

83
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
Infer there we want none of it

84
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:00,384
Yeah it mean if it is really been an amazing company to watch every obviously they're probably best known for the

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
The GPU Technologies

86
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,016
That was Prince I guess in gaming for the place where they started but

87
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Damn movie

88
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
Automobiles now

89
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,416
And two other Ai and ml with vision recognition and so on

90
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,976
And you can even do image recognition with that

91
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
Little Jetson Nano

92
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,815
It just is a few watts of power button

93
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
That you mentioned that the 10 trillion

94
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,935
Operations per second for the T4 servers

95
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,775
A half a trillion operations per second

96
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,591
And that kind of processing power at the edge

97
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
When you need that

98
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,687
When you're using it safe for image recognition in a vehicle

99
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,503
That milliseconds or microseconds matter

100
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
You need to have that kind of

101
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
Accessing power at the edge so that's impressive

102
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
And I will also say that it's

103
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
10000

104
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Oh wow

105
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
I don't actually do with the number

106
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
Okay so

107
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,631
Nvidia has also done a partnership

108
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,471
For this so it software will integrate in with red hat openshift

109
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
Kubernetes container network

110
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
Registration platform

111
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,127
So that's important because a lot of people are running containers at the edge and

112
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
You want everything

113
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
Working all the way together

114
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
And

115
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,319
If it is also working with tons of companies from Dell

116
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,159
Which is a sponsor of the show Cisco hpe Lenovo

117
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
Alta bring out

118
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
Servers that are going to be

119
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Egx

120
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
Gray Tennessee GX platform

121
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
Is

122
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:31,263
How to fix part of or is compatible with one of the two with their Edge stack Nvidia Edge stack

123
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
Can be tied in with

124
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,615
AWS iot Greengrass or Microsoft

125
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
Azure iot Edge so

126
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,431
You get device management

127
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
As well with us

128
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,247
What time it is I don't say Google

129
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,063
But I was going to say that but

130
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
User

131
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,903
Get uncomfortable

132
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:54,815
It was interesting ly I mean Google's got tensorflow and its Hardware partners and makes its own chips for that

133
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,655
I don't think this work with tensorflow but I saw mention of

134
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Some other

135
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
Tensor cortical product

136
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Tensor RT that's it

137
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,359
I'll tell you Google is not in high demand among any when I talk

138
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,431
Santa Fe Enterprise in India

139
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Maybe one day

140
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,783
They're trying to change that but it hasn't happened yet

141
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
What it's going to take a little bit

142
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,367
But they do have them in their Thomas kurian

143
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
It could happen

144
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,207
Happys Pizza for Oracle

145
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
Sales guy so

146
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,607
He's an article I thought

147
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,655
He lives in the cave

148
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
I predict cloud computing will be big

149
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,007
Oh I don't think Oracle did that

150
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,567
Cloud computing jokes

151
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Let's talk about Sony

152
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,151
They came out of nowhere

153
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,223
With their own low-power wide area network

154
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,295
And they built a chip that basically will be optimized for it

155
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
This is basically

156
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
Right

157
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,951
I'm kind of Blown Away that I read this correctly or is it a mistake

158
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,767
Transmission up to 60 miles

159
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,887
Yeah it can transport that's what it says 60 miles work in a noisy Urban environments

160
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
Object moving at high speed

161
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
I mean this is different

162
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:10,335
From some of the other option so I'm actually going to reach out to so need to try to get someone on the show to talk about the

163
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
This is crazy

164
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,967
They're talking about finding this using it to find people using

165
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Things

166
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,575
It's going to transmit in the 920 megahertz band

167
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
And Sony calls at the

168
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
El trece

169
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
E l t r e s

170
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
That band

171
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:33,631
That's a long-range band we have a lot in the US we have 915

172
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
Is where you see a lot of

173
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Long range

174
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
But that's online

175
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
So again

176
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
A lot of questions

177
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
Mostly about

178
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
Who's going to use it

179
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,687
Who's going to use it as an Technologies going to be in

180
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
Japan I was going to stay with that

181
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,527
I like using that particular

182
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
Wireless

183
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Spectrum

184
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
Means it couldn't be in the

185
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879

186
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647

187
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439

00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Unlicensed

189
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
But

190
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,791
Sony is going to try it Japan

191
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
Show it off and

192
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,167
It got their special chip for it and they launched an application program

193
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
That interested companies can apply

194
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
To trap a check

195
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,871
We'll have to see who actually does this an influencer

196
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
Tries to use it

197
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,991
You mentioned like tracking things and whatnot so she's cars or

198
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
Buses

199
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:26,879
They have a drone location monitoring of a drone I would love to like control and drone

200
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
Like a half hour that would be pretty cool

201
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
Don't like

202
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,767
Control it so looking I don't think so

203
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
Looking at the specs

204
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
Halo as a hunter

205
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
Yeah I got something

206
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:42,751
If that's why they say location monitoring of a drill not not actual control of it unfortunately for me but

207
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,799
Am home delivery tracking

208
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079

External defibrillator

210
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,687
Yacht Race tracking something I do all the time

211
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Master time

212
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,527
Marine rescue Landslide reports MN

213
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,599
Things that take place further away than

214
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
Most other things

215
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
60 miles

216
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,999

Lorawan

218
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
Which is another low-power wide array

219
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,119
That transmits it

220
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
Small amount of data for about a mile

221
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
So that's

222
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,543
Is your next longest then you got nb-iot

223
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Which

224
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,615
Uses the cellular network so there's just existing

225
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,967
This is really interesting LLC if we can't find someone to talk

226
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
All right

227
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
Let's move from

228
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,623
The industrial Edge and the low-power wide area Networks

229
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
To the home

230
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
People ask us all the time

231
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
About hubs

232
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
For your smart ones that are not just Bluetooth and Wi-Fi but maybe have

233
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
Zigbee and Z-Wave

234
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,679
And it's always looking around this weekend on the web

235
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
I saw

236
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,007
Tp-link deco mesh

237
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
Network

238
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,823
There's no different than any other

239
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,431
Mesh product out there so just Google WiFi orbi velop whatever

240
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Except

241
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
The Deco M9 Plus

242
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Doubles

243
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,831
As a smart home hub

244
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,391
With Bluetooth WiFi and zigbee

245
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
Sonos Z-Wave

246
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
But this is

247
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,559
Interesting it's not necessarily new but it's not something that I had seen before

248
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,375
Some thinking about trying to get a review unit because

249
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:18,495
I'm happy with my wing but I don't know what's going to happen with it in the future so

250
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
What options do I have other than say

251
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,591
SmartThings or habitat

252
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,663
It's just another interesting option

253
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,735
And I love the fact that it's built into

254
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
Wi-fi system just like

255
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,111
You can do with Samsung does that they have an offering a dozen

256
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
I think so

257
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
This doesn't have Z-Wave so this looks

258
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
Kind of like the Echo Plus

259
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
You know that's a good point

260
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,375
Any octopuses in something I really look at only because I

261
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Don't

262
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
Have really imagine a home that much anymore

263
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
So you're right

264
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,311
But the Echo Plus isn't like a mesh Network system

265
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
No it is not

266
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
As a home

267
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
Hub

268
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,711
Yeah from what I can see here

269
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,551
It's kind of limited in what it supports even though it has the three radios

270
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
Tp-link says

271
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,647
Roughly over a hundred devices are supported

272
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
Yeah

273
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
SmartThings has the most

274
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
Yes will it also has that additional Z-Wave radio

275
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,631
But the challenge with zigbee and I found this when I was playing with the Echo Plus has

276
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,679
Sometimes you'll bring a device in just

277
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
The network

278
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
Detected the software doesn't

279
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Might work together

280
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
Is gym difficult

281
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,407
And you mentioned the Echo Plus

282
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:35,807
Tp-link Deco M9 plus is compatible with madhumeh and works with if this then that

283
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,599
It does not mention anything about

284
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
Google Assistant

285
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
So

286
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,231
I mean I'm still surprised that with the Sonos integration

287
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:48,863
Google Assistant you have to choose between one or the other so I imagine that bifurcations just going to get

288
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
More and more

289
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
Clear to us and Them

290
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,263
I think so I mean I don't really think people want multiple

291
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,567
Give me options but they don't want

292
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,359
To use multiple

293
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
PetSmart

294
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
Assistance in the home

295
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,479
I think I use it on a daily basis but I am a little

296
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:11,135
This reminds me Kevin last We we forgot to share the big news from Google / nest

297
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,695
So we should probably talk about it today which is

298
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
2 weeks ago

299
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,071
The world was all aflutter because of Google IO Google said

300
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
That

301
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Nest

302
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,447
It would basically kill API access to Nest devices

303
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,007
And all Nest Integrations would then go through

304
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Google home

305
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,103
Right after recorded the pot

306
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
The day after we recorded the podcast

307
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,711
Google had got so much pushback

308
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
Haha just kidding

309
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
So now

310
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
This we should have talked about last week

311
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
But now what's going to happen is

312
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,743
If you have a nest device that is part of a supported

313
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
Integration right now

314
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
It will stay the way it is

315
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
So nothing will break

316
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,655
But if you want

317
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,215
Provided you do not

318
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,775
Switch from a nest account to a Google account

319
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
Right so you

320
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
You can't add anything and you can't

321
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
You can't change it

322
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
That's basically it so

323
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,479
It's kind of like you know

324
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,271
You remember the old unlimited data

325
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Actually in love

326
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
The grandfather people kept

327
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,159
10 still have yes yes but you can't change anything

328
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,487
You must always pay your bill on time and everything must be perfect

329
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
This is that kind of thing

330
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:26,143
So if you want to be grandfathered into your existing nest Integrations and your home works just fine

331
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
Don't do anything

332
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Now

333
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,847
What Google says is eventually they're going to start launching new features through the Google

334
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Home

335
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Nest

336
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,967
Version of that I don't even know what to call it

337
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:45,599
I haven't named it yet really going forward with that and so new features will

338
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Come there and you may miss out

339
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,927
You know if you're happy with what you

340
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,463
But I would say wait

341
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
Don't you agree

342
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
And then if a new feature comes out that you

343
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
Look how it got to have that

344
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
Recognize that

345
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
You're going to trade that feature

346
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
For basically reconstructing although

347
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
Integration City

348
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
Which may be worth it

349
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
Open my Facebook

350
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:12,735
What does she do not only is it better for everybody who has things that work with Nest today

351
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
This

352
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,599
Helps give more time to the third party to do the Integrations

353
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,231
Because basically it was a complete surprise to all of them when Google announced this

354
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,023
So I talked to him and they were like

355
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Can we do about it

356
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Oh

357
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
Yeah I know

358
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
So

359
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
Some of my people were told

360
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Totally floored

361
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
We're not

362
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
Silly nda's

363
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
Silly silly

364
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
Wanted to give you guys update on that cuz I felt terrible this

365
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
It was just bad timing

366
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
So

367
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Let's talk about

368
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Madam

369
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,599
Yeah this is nothing major but I noticed on the

370
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,647
Amazon Madam a Blog

371
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,511
That they are introducing announcements on Madam a built-in devices

372
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
So

373
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,095
If you have a third-party device

374
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
Orbs you

375
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
Having fun with your own

376
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,495
Amazon voice Services implementation may be with a Raspberry Pi

377
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,311
You will be able to put the announcements

378
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,871
Feature in your device so that's kind of cool

379
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,407
There's so many good third party app

380
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,967
You know that work with matinee and Google home for that matter

381
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,039
But you always end up getting limited by what

382
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
You can't do as much as the native

383
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,951
Yeah and I wish that you know Amazon would be a little bit more clear about some of these things so like

384
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
I would love to have guard

385
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,279
Ansible

386
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,559
Other devices

387
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,839
Just to act as back-up

388
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,679
Capsule maybe there's an Amazon capable device in my house

389
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
That's not

390
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
It's in another room

391
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Right

392
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
And I would like for that to be guard

393
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
But so far it's not

394
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,431
It's actually quite common for

395
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
Both

396
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
Amazon and Google to

397
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
Keep things

398
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,647
On their own devices for a little while to help sell product and then eventually open it up

399
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
In fact

400
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:01,023
Google pixel phones typically get these really cool whiz-bang features

401
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,863
And then three four months later they start filtering down to other

402
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
Harvard Partners devices

403
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
I know it sucks but it's the

404
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,239
I got it

405
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
It is

406
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
All right

407
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
So this is good news

408
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,967
6 representatives in the US House have an ounce

409
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,527
Legislation called the hot cars Act

410
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,343
And what this is it's going to require

411
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,903
Automakers to offer safety alerts

412
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
To prevent leaving kids

413
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,999
In a backseat in there

414
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
RC's unattended

415
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,839
So what happens is every year during the summer

416
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Especially

417
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
Texas where I live

418
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
Stories will start popping up

419
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,519
As a parent who is left their child unattended the backseat of

420
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
And

421
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,871
Basically what usually happens as the parent goes to

422
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
Twerk

423
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,199
Forgot maybe they don't normally take the kid

424
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
I thought they dropped him off at daycare

425
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,087
I just got out of the car they're on autopilot they walk into work and then come back and there's a day

426
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,671
It's terribly sad yes

427
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
So

428
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
The idea is

429
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Dad

430
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
This particular legislation

431
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,839
They want cars to alert drivers

432
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
When there is a child left on

433
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
In the backseat

434
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,239
And the representatives are basically saying

435
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,311
We are to do this we leave your keys in the car

436
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,127
Do you leave your door open all of those things give you away

437
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,455
The reason why we're talking about it one is cuz it's

438
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
I don't know what is a parent

439
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,575
And that's what it was in one of these states where this happens

440
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
A dozen times each summer

441
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,903
Is it a big issue

442
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
And it's

443
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:37,279
Terrible and I feel like there should be some sort of connected device

444
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Help with it

445
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,839
Son of actually seen several

446
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Companies

447
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Come forth

448
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Trying

449
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,447
A solution for this

450
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,543
But none of them have actually come to market yet and I'm very curious as to why

451
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,639
Yeah I mean it's certainly a fixable problem and

452
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,711
We first before the show star talk about it I'm like I mean

453
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:02,111
People really do that come on but then you pointed out that and how many deaths there were in your state just last year long

454
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,951
We don't have them here because it's been so many just doesn't nearly

455
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
Isn't nearly as hot

456
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
Maybe we do have them but I don't I don't care about the most

457
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,399
You could probably jerry-rig your own kind of thing with maybe a Bluetooth

458
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,215
Tracker or something but I mean you shouldn't be sticking things on your

459
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,519
Your kids are the car seat you know but

460
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,103
This really is avoidable and we have the technology to do it probably on the cheap

461
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
So

462
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Why the heck not

463
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:31,295
There's companies that have like Smart Fabric Center so if you put like if you are a car seat manufacturer and you

464
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
Put a

465
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Weighted sensor

466
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
Can someone's

467
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
RC

468
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
And I could tie to the parents

469
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,279
Phone I mean most people do have phones while they're driving in the

470
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Their car

471
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
That could be like an

472
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Yeezy

473
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
Jessie easy Ops

474
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,215
There is a device called the eclipse and you clip that too

475
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,751
Your baby's car seat

476
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,079
And if you leave them in the car seat in the car stops moving

477
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
It basically starts

478
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Is beeping at you

479
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,455
And this is a $50 device so

480
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,991
That's one option there

481
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,807
And they did a Kickstarter

482
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
Fairly recent

483
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,391
They also have an accessory strap that you

484
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
You can use to strap the

485
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
Put other things

486
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,255
I think these sorts of things are really important

487
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
I think it's

488
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,327
If it's regulated and mandated

489
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,935
It'd be safer if it were part of the integrated car system to be honest

490
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
Like the latch system is in cars

491
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,287
So I would I would really like to

492
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
To see something like this

493
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Because

494
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,895
In the last two decades 800 children

495
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Have died

496
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:36,319
Yes it's two decades but these are highly preventable and horrifying desk exactly you can't put a price

497
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,367
Song somebody's life especially innocent

498
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
Child and infant

499
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,695
Or even coming over extends to pets

500
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,511
Sports like if that's one thing we do hear about here in Pennsylvania

501
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,071
People leaving their pets in a hot car and

502
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,375
What a torturous thing to do and then it's

503
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,423
Even if it's accidental let me know

504
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
It still

505
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
Horrendous

506
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Putting out

507
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,055
That's a little bit of a downer topic but

508
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
We'll move on to something

509
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
May not

510
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,431
Be as much of a downer who knows

511
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,991
This may not be a great Segway photos

512
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,879
WWDC which is the Apple worldwide developer conference is coming up

513
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
When is it next week

514
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:17,023
It is next week or first week of June

515
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
And

516
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
We're always hopeful for him

517
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,935
You don't care about the fifth year in a row we're hopeful

518
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Yeah

519
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,031
I think it's only the third year

520
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
Last year there wasn't me

521
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
If there's homekit news

522
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Yay

523
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,687
The only other thing that's interesting is

524
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,503
There's been some rumors about Apple launching a

525
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,319
Tile like device that would tie into the iPhone

526
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
Help you find

527
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
Keys

528
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,159
Well it's whatever

529
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
Kids kids

530
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
Who knows

531
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,071
It's always a Bluetooth Bass Tracker is what they're possibly lunch

532
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
You know part of me is like

533
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
Jay

534
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
But the other part of me is like

535
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,519
It kind of sucks because I really like something that's

536
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,335
Not just integrated in the Apple system

537
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
You know

538
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:08,223
True but there is a benefit here if the rumor pans out because the rumor is that

539
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,783
Sensitive Bluetooth device it would act like

540
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
Airpods and bat

541
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
Pairing

542
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
Is managed through

543
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
ICloud

544
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,768
And what that means this is like with airpods I can switch from one Mac to another to an iPhone whatever

545
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,328
Are the iPods because

546
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
All that has handles on the cloud side

547
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,728
This would presumably work the same way so your Bluetooth tracker is

548
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
Madison iCloud

549
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,288
And as a result

550
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
Unlike the tiles

551
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,152
Today and other Bluetooth trackers were you have to hope

552
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,456
Somebody crowdsources

553
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
Finds it.

554
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,296
Tile or somebody else with the tile

555
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
Is ready

556
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
Is running

557
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,672
Exactly the difference here is

558
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
In theory you haven't

559
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,512
Tire iOS population

560
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,912
Looking for your device passively they never know it but if they stumble within range and their Bluetooth on

561
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,984
ICloud wouldn't know and the user of the Lost

562
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,032
Item will get a notification

563
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
So

564
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,104
It should handle privacy

565
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
Very well and

566
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
It should

567
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,688
Massive expansion

568
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,272
The base of people who are looking for you know they don't know they looking for

569
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
Your lost item

570
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Well in areas where Apple

571
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
Well yeah that's it in there

572
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,232
Well they're sold all over the place

573
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512
But there's definitely parts of

574
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
The world

575
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
True

576
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
True true

577
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
Probably don't have

578
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,824
You know the other thing is tile has been working very hard on a partnership program so you can buy like Land Rovers and Penn

579
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
Umbrellas that

580
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
Have integrated tile

581
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,736
Technology basically it's not even a tile it's just a Bluetooth chip with their software running

582
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
And

583
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,320
That might be an interesting business

584
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
Applicant

585
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
Right

586
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:56,000
Running putting a Bluetooth sensor inside every object and then having it run on this iOS

587
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
Network

588
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
Suddenly you have

589
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
Just a cute arant trackable

590
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,680
And that's an interesting future

591
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
Although again

592
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
I hate that is a closed because

593
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
Right there with you

594
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,944
Alright well we'll hear more about Apple actually because our guest this week is your room Greco who is

595
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,760
The CEO of Eve and they are a popular

596
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:24,416
Sensor maker they bet entirely on homekit that's all Eve sells is homekit Bay sensors and Smart Home Products

597
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,464
So he's going to talk about

598
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,584
Kind of where he's at with that and his take on what Apple's been doing in the

599
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
Ecosystem

600
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
But before that

601
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,936

Okay so this week

615
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,048
We have a voicemail from Dodie

616
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
Blue cheese from

617
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
Canada

618
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,656
And she is looking for a smart home

619
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:12,032
So let's hear it. Stacey I'm calling from Prince Edward Island in Canada

620
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,336
My name is Jody crane

621
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,640
And I'm in the planning stages for a new

622
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
House

623
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,968
My question is in your opinion

624
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
What are the

625
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,760
Top five

626
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
Must have

627
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
Smart Home

628
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
Components that I

629
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
Should include

630
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,392
In the design of my new place

631
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,440
Thanks a lot from Canada

632
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
Psy

633
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
Dan Cody

634
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
Being a part of this

635
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,864
So I'm going to say like two of these probably two of my top five

636
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,912
Probably depend on your use cases so

637
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
But I will say

638
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
I think every house

639
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,520
Should have some sort of smart

640
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,312
They can connect out

641
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,896
I chose Lutron in my house so

642
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,272
That's just me and I did that because the light switches are nice I like having a Smart Switch

643
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,320
Philips is actually change the game

644
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,160
Also with LaShawn because they've launched a new device called the

645
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
Aurora that attaches to

646
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,720
Existing switch

647
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
How to use Smart bulbs

648
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,816
But still for most people I would say

649
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,632
To swap out all your light switches with Lutron light switches

650
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,168
Get a Lutron hub

651
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,704
And then Wallah

652
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
You have smart

653
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
2

654
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,592
She's talking about new house design would you

655
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,896
Is he just did this couple years back.

656
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
That house built

657
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
Would you

658
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,528
Strictly go with mesh Wi-Fi

659
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
Which we both use today

660
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,368
Where would you put in

661
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,184
Wired ethernet ports pretty much everywhere as well

662
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,256
I love myself some wires I

663
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
I would want mesh Wi-Fi

664
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
But I would put

665
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,864
For sure

666
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,936
I would put ethernet in every room of the house I did it last time

667
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,960
I don't regret it

668
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
If

669
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,520
I wanted to skip

670
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:51,360
On ethernet I would put it where I knew I was going to have televisions

671
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,664
So I could at least wire in my televisions

672
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,456
And I would probably put ethernet in the

673
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
The office

674
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:00,576
Yeah so they're obviously the time to do it is when duties

675
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,136
Designing building her new house I mean after the fact it's

676
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:07,232
Palacios to do and I would say when you're building a new house

677
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
Deeper than expected

678
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,888
Switch boxes because that'll help you with like your Lutron lights cuz they're smarter and they take up more of your

679
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
The switch box

680
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,960
So that's the light

681
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
We decided on

682
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,032
Need high-quality mesh Wi-Fi

683
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,568
I also think

684
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:25,664
A nest hello doorbell unless you're a die-hard madame a user

685
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,200
And then I would go with the ring door

686
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
But

687
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
I think having a video doorbell

688
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Nice

689
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,112
You know we didn't include we didn't include door locks

690
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,160
That was so we didn't we were remiss

691
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,464
So I would also include

692
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
Keypad door lock

693
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,048
It doesn't have to be

694
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,120
Smart II don't get a lot of value out of having a Smart Lock

695
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,656
Some people really like having it

696
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
Like a good night routine that will

697
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
Lock your door for you

698
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,800
So if that's important to you but I do like having a keypad entry

699
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,824
Because then you don't have to

700
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
Nikes

701
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
That is a win

702
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:01,504
And some people do ever change for when I get home then. They don't want to rely on geofencing

703
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,832
So they might highlights or music or something to

704
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:11,232
Unlocking the door for preheating an oven absolutely

705
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:15,840
And then I would say smart thermostat there's no reason not to put a smart thermostat on your

706
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Agreed

707
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
And

708
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,936
That we like ecobee

709
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
Nest is fine

710
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,264
Again depends on if your

711
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
How do you feel about

712
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:29,152
Google ecosystem versus the Amazon ecosystem be Kobe plays well with both

713
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,992
Honeywell I tried 35 that just launched the T9 and T

714
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
T10 thermostats those are nice

715
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
So those are some good option

716
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:42,976
It's like my ecobee because of the remote sensor so I think other people are there companies are adding them

717
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,888
And I think Nest has it you can buy a nest for

718
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
Remote sensor

719
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:55,776
The reason I didn't I think it's because you could be had them first and I switched

720
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,080
So I went from Nest to go get here

721
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,152
And then finally in your Smart House

722
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,200
I threw in a securities

723
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,296
You could design a wired security system in your house

724
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,856
That is so retro

725
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,136
Does Effy wrestler you get

726
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,440
It does I think

727
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:19,840
Securities personal not everybody wants to spend the money to do it and today you can really do a lot of it yourself with some

728
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
Strategic planning on

729
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:25,984
Where to put webcams for apps or sound sensors or other sensors so

730
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,592
Just think about where you might want to be monitoring things with certain doors and windows

731
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
Rooms and areas

732
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,176
If you can do it yourself in or some good

733
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,456
Options out there

734
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
Your packages

735
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,760
Okay

736
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,296
I was going to recommend

737
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,832
Abode or SimpliSafe

738
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
If you're going to do it yourself

739
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,464
I guess those are my top five you may want you know smart speakers throughout

740
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Your house

741
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
Really depends on your use case

742
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:53,888
But I would add one more thing that's not necessarily for Smart's but

743
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
For convenience

744
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:59,264
I am getting such a thrill out of swapping out all of my

745
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,080
Electrical outlets the old ones with

746
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,152
Newer Outlets that also include USB ports

747
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,248
Yeah and it's not just for charging devices a lot of

748
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
Smaller

749
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,832
Smart devices even webcams and what

750
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,672
Eventually you are running on like micro USB

751
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,208
Dallas

752
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
Yes that is actually

753
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,024
When I'm

754
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
Doing my next home

755
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
That is going to be one of my first

756
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
Renovations is

757
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
Yep take all those

758
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,448
Maybe not all of them but like in

759
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
Areas where

760
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
My kitchen counter

761
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
I know that

762
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,312
Behind my bed

763
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,384
Pics of the bed

764
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,736
Cassoulet or were you going to have you have a webcam or something else that can run off USB

765
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,624
I know that's why I'm retrofitting all of mine

766
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,184
All right we'll Dodi I hope that helps you

767
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
And good luck

768
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976

All right

770
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:56,096
I think we've reached the end of this second of the podcast and

771
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,144
I would love for you guys to stay tuned

772
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,168
4

773
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
Jerome Greco

774
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
Talking about

775
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,496
If sensors

776
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,544
And the future of homekit

777
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,336
Stay tuned for that

778
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,152
And now a word from our sponsor

779
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:15,552
Hey everyone we're taking a quick break for The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor

780
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,856
Where is Dell Technologies and I have

781
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
Hendel's

782
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,976
The general manager of Dell Technologies industry iot

783
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,024
Iot Safety and Security

784
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,816
And computer vision

785
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
10

786
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
That is a lot of titles

787
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,168
So what is your business exactly

788
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,544
Our excited to be here and sponsor this second

789
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,592
Most people in the podcast probably know that

790
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,664
Surveillance cameras

791
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,480
It has been used for calorie video gated at the edge

792
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
For over 20 years

793
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,576
Don't be a sensor to become much more intelligent

794
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,880
Much more capable

795
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
This is a quiet customer

796
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Look at 6

797
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,280
Security in Asbury new paradigm

798
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,608
Insecurities

799
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,168
And also wanted to integrate this video

800
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,192
Iot data

801
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,752
Good morning to apply analytics to make their decision

802
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,336
This is happening across all of our customer

803
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,688
It's a real challenge that we have right now

804
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:20,576
A few months ago Dell Technologies lunch the Dell Technologies iot solution for surveillance

805
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,648
He told me that this solution can handle

806
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,440
Some enormous use cases

807
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:29,536
I believe that one customer with over 250000 cameras

808
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:33,120
And another who is dealing with a hundred and twenty petabyte

809
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,144
Video store

810
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,192
That is an enormous amount of

811
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,728
Cameras and data

812
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,032
How has the solution changed

813
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
From the time that you've launched

814
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,128
We started with those complex cost

815
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Bat size range

816
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
Challenges

817
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,040
Density of cameras and not quantity

818
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:55,136
Storage want to stop there

819
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,928
Downtobuck smaller system

820
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
Cities in deployment

821
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,096
Envoy management and lifecycle management

822
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
10 days.

823
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:05,888
30 days

824
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
Years

825
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,496
Want to make it easier for scalable

826
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,544
Cost-effective blog

827
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,664
I said all right. Who would benefit most

828
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
From this type of

829
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
Absolution

830
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,016
What great things about today

831
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
Security data

832
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,112
That affects everybody it doesn't matter if your hospital

833
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,648
School stadium

834
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416
Assateague

835
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,696
Enterprise customer

836
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,768
Transformers technology that is a quart

837
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,096
Address problems

838
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,144
Regardless of the customer type

839
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,240
But really where customers need a very supportable scalable

840
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,568
Secure solution to the boy named it to the Rockets game

841
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,432
Great so can where can folks go to learn more about Dell Technologies

842
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,992
And the iot solution for surveillance

843
00:32:54,016 --> 00:33:00,160
PlayStation 4 shake the time

844
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,976
Adele technology.com

845
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,800
Everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

846
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
Jerome

847
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
Kraken

848
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,640
Who is the CEO of Eve

849
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
Systems

850
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,200
Hello Jerome how are you today

851
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,480
I'm doing great

852
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,760
Excellent

853
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,784
All right

854
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,904
You guys have been around for a really long time in the Smart Home Park

855
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,232
Do you want to just tell us a little bit about Eve's Origins

856
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
In the Smart Home

857
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:41,888
So even being a pretty 20 years ago in Los Gatos in California

858
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:45,216
And we people cheat on business free times

859
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:50,848
Our last move was to sell of a gaming activity in July last year

860
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:56,992
And since then we are fully dedicated to Connected home device

861
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,808
Under The Apple homekit

862
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
Platform

863
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,160
Okay well let's start there because

864
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
It feels like

865
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,512
Held so much promise early on

866
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:14,912
I feels like actually entire smart home ecosystem held so much promise early on in the 2013-2014 timeframe

867
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:21,056
Feels like things have stalled a little bit not just in the overall Home Market but also with Apple's homekit

868
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,592
Can you give us a sense of

869
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,640
Where do you think the market is today

870
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,176
So

871
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,200
Social

872
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:33,600
Is true that everyone was thinking 2:20 or so smart to a market with very very big

873
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
Promise

874
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,416
How eyebrows

875
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,720
Penetration of smartwatch

876
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,256
Mitsubishi in Europe

877
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
Is quite slow

878
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,608
And this is my schedule of

879
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,168
Education the consumer on

880
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,960
What are the benefits

881
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
That jeep

882
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,128
Connected home product and it's not too much related to the technology which platform

883
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:00,480
But about which use case Are you delivering to the consumer

884
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,016
And refilling that

885
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,344
Homekit is a great benefit

886
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:10,464
What was the consumer because it solved free major problem

887
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,512
The first one

888
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:17,376
It gives you the pussy BDT to have a seamless installation

889
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
Ulcer products

890
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,936
Ordon products

891
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,240
Install in one click

892
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
Your dress

893
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
Take a picture

894
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
The Opera

895
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
Trueaccord on the product

896
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,688
And you can cornhole

897
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,248
Zip product formula iPhone

898
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,552
Your iPod or your iWatch

899
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,856
You do not need to install

900
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
Home hub

901
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
20 Wi-Fi Hotel

902
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,232
Or any Gateway

903
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
Not all

904
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
Specific app

905
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,584
And your phone

906
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,448
Hopper app is on old iPhone

907
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
Origins

908
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,032
So in one second

909
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,848
You are installing and controlling a product

910
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,896
And this is a key benefit

911
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,944
That's right getting 12 uses

912
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
Okay and that makes sense

913
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:10,624
It feels like the connectivity part has really changed a little bit over the years Apple did

914
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
Make this seamless

915
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,232
But Amazon and Google are now working with

916
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,768
Gorham seamless Wi-Fi ever

917
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,816
What else has Apple done

918
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,840
To make this

919
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,376
Is smart home effort easier

920
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,704
In fact I like talking husband on

921
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,264
But I lost a little things

922
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,592
Has been communicated to the consumer

923
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,384
So I also work

924
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,432
Apple benefit

925
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,224
Especially in Tamil

926
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,504
Security

927
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,296
And data privacy

928
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,832
To be

929
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,904
Numbers most home away

930
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,208
This is the third largest island that we are

931
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
So

932
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,280
Today that is not anymore

933
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,560
Technological

934
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
Challenge

935
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,608
Which is more

936
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
Emotional

937
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,680
Challenge to cool Bay

938
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:59,008
Does key benefit of the Apple homekit platform

939
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,312
Twitter user on a group

940
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,360
And not only

941
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,920
So few authors fan

942
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,456
Well knowing what

943
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
About

944
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,504
Hyperdontia

945
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
Okay

946
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,552
Ease-of-use

947
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:17,696
Ease of installation and privacy are those the three things that have made kind of Apple's ecosystem a little bit different

948
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,280
It is one of Sophie and or so we should not forgot

949
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
Security aspect

950
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,632
Because with Apple homekit

951
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,192
You are really a fool

952
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,240
Data encryption

953
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,288
Between you product

954
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,080
Cell phone

955
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,872
M2 operating costs

956
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,784
We don't have any Cloud infrastructure

957
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
Connected home experience

958
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,952
Just only have

959
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,488
Local product

960
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,512
And iPhone

961
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:56,096
There is no Cloud infrastructure in between

962
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,632
So what does it mean

963
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,656
It's raining.

964
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,496
Stay inside the product

965
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
So what

966
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
Spiritual

967
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,128
American Deli Brown. Privacy

968
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,712
The user at the global scale

969
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:17,856
That's interesting so how do you guys work with some of the Integrations that you have I know that you have an integration with

970
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,648
Hue bulbs for example or

971
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,952
Maybe how does that privacy stance

972
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,768
Interfere with your ability to do some of the energy

973
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,864
So we are integrating other devices

974
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,680
The Apple homekit

975
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
Infrastructure

976
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,032
So it is only cheated with

977
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,056
Home hub

978
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,616
Apple TV

979
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:44,480
All the iPod and behind it happened crossword clue

980
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,016
But anyway

981
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296
There is no

982
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,392
Infrastructure

983
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:55,488
To make integration happen between frog party

984
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
Product

985
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,792
Okay

986
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:04,192
It felt like apple came a little bit late which is fine that's totally what Apple does but

987
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:09,312
Then it also felt like with the rise of the Amazon Echo and Google home assistant

988
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:15,456
Markets that Apple through kind of the homepod over the fence and then left it there

989
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,552
And it feels like we haven't seen a lot from Apple on the smart

990
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,856
Are you disappointed in that

991
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,672
Disappointment

992
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,232
Is that

993
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,560
Alex Amazon Alexa or Google home

994
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,120
Have driving connected Home Products

995
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,912
Things to boys

996
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
Colt Ford

997
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,496
And what we see he

998
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,544
In Europe country

999
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,336
The adoption of

1000
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,640
See if he has a voice phone call

1001
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,688
Online phone call

1002
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:50,272
Connected home device penetration is quite true

1003
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,832
People are not using as much

1004
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:56,160
Sealy as we can see in the US market

1005
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,184
Cheer in Europe

1006
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,768
And this is one of the challenge that we have

1007
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:06,400
Yes we stopped at home key travel course your boys going forward but in fact

1008
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,216
People eating you up on the choosing it

1009
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
It is there

1010
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:19,456
I figured that summer language reason is you speak to me in English I was I live in the u.s. doing 10

1011
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,528
Speak English like this

1012
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,624
So I think that some difficulty to be understood in your local language

1013
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,904
Oh that makes sense

1014
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
It's okay I lack of accent

1015
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:37,632
It's tough you know you're out there you're speaking a second language possibly a third and then you get dinged for it

1016
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,168
Do you feel

1017
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,776
Because there is a lot of communication with apple when you're producing home kit

1018
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,312
Products Daredevil

1019
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
Very rigorous

1020
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,128
Set of rules associated with

1021
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,456
Is Apple still serious about the Smart Home

1022
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,784
Wii theme song

1023
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,320
How many

1024
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,648
Apple product inside the home

1025
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,928
Going from

1026
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,208
The iPhone

1027
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:05,536
The MacBook Pro the iPad DIY

1028
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
So homepod

1029
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,352
The Apple TV

1030
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,168
Wishing that apple have radius

1031
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:14,240
Trump ecosystem inside the home

1032
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
I believe

1033
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,592
But I mean we strongly believe

1034
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,384
That's awkward takes a home

1035
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
Shutter speed

1036
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,712
Today it is true

1037
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,528
Down facing some competition with

1038
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,368
Amazon Alexa and Google home that seems to

1039
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,440
To be in front of his friends

1040
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,512
Watching the long run we are still feminine.

1041
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,816
Apple has a key

1042
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,864
Leading position in this market

1043
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,240
And this is why we are going at 12 everyday and try to develop a pecan kit

1044
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,520
East Cuisine

1045
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,288
Product

1046
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:53,919
It's true you guys you guys are consistently putting out new stuff which I really appreciate and I'm sure

1047
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,223
All the people out there who are homekit enabled

1048
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,295
Appreciate as well we get a lot of requests

1049
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,319
For homekit

1050
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,599
Capable products

1051
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,391
With that in mind

1052
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,927
I actually saw

1053
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:09,023
You guys had a wonderful blog post probably about a year-and-a-half ago

1054
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:12,863
About creating a homekit capable security system

1055
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,935
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the products

1056
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
Could be used to do that

1057
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,287
Because there are lots of consumers out there who are like

1058
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:24,127
I really want to do this security thing but I don't know if I want another hub

1059
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,407
A bunch of other devices

1060
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,943
Can you talk briefly about that

1061
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:33,343
So you know it's true that we see that the smartphone market is

1062
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,879
3 + 5

1063
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,439
Security application

1064
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,231
And on our side

1065
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,815
Remember want to be a number two and number three

1066
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,351
Inside a category

1067
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:50,495
And what receiver got shenzhen IP camera in the high-tech camera

1068
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,775
GE Profile

1069
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
We're already

1070
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,383
Quite loud so we decided to do not invest

1071
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,175
Indus category

1072
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,735
But for sure we are looking

1073
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
How to grow

1074
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,831
More song inside the secret aspect

1075
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,367
And little girl wedgie

1076
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,135
On

1077
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,415
The fence all that

1078
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,439
Github

1079
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,719
Rich

1080
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,767
Subduing window sensor

1081
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
Some

1082
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,327
Smoke pencil

1083
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,143
A movement detector

1084
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:22,751
And it's easy to set all that up as a security system using is it

1085
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,567
Conditions are routines what is it that apple

1086
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
Calls there

1087
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,871
Turn alchemation of

1088
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,735
I think if you're leaving a apartment

1089
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:37,599
The most easy way to set up a security system

1090
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,903
Is to cool a door and window

1091
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,927
Sensor

1092
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
On your front

1093
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,487
Adult

1094
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,791
Because the statistics show that

1095
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,839
You should live in Aberdeen

1096
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,375
If there is a break-in

1097
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,703
Take me to enter through the main door entrance

1098
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,239
I'm just by touching

1099
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,287
A door and window sensor

1100
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,359
Wikipedia for Deadpool at $49

1101
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,639
You get another

1102
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,943
Thanks to Apple homekit

1103
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,503
Once a door is open

1104
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,039
Normandin Falls always open

1105
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,111
And let's talk about sensors forum

1106
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:15,231
Because you guys have been developing Bluetooth Pace sensors because Apple supports only Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

1107
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,255
And

1108
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,791
This is been a tough

1109
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,863
Area to find products in so I'm very curious

1110
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,167
What are the challenges associated with

1111
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,191
Bluetooth sensor

1112
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,471
As soon as battery

1113
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
I don't know

1114
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,055
Foster to adopt

1115
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,335
I want Wireless

1116
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,615

1136
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,943
Knowing that

1137
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,967
Bluetooth

1138
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,759
You had one drawback

1139
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:14,367
Which is the range of the wireless photocard

1140
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
And we are

1141
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,671
Walking

1142
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,743

These French

1144
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,047
This is a Frost Bank

1145
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,351
And the circle under

1146
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,631
What we see

1147
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,399

Walkie on Bluetooth

1150
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:35,359
And we see that our consumer and I'll buy you one sensor

1151
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,383
And many times

1152
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,687
Two or three other products

1153
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,503
Paris time

1154
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,039
Prove that

1155
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,063
Syringe

1156
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,855
Is not an issue

1157
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,951
Oh that's good yes cuz I I will say that I

1158
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:53,535
And I lived in a strange house but I always had a lot of problems of like

1159
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,887
I want to turn off my lights upstairs but I'm downstairs in the range is terrible

1160
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:05,055
What about something like Bluetooth mesh now that that technology is come out and is certified is that something that you're

1161
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
I'm looking at

1162
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:11,711
Of course we have to investigate or Alive grade of Bluetooth and we are

1163
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,991
Isis theme song

1164
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,063
And do you have a sense of the

1165
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:21,439
Drawbacks I I've been told that Bluetooth mesh does have higher battery consumptions just

1166
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,255
Based on the fact that it's waking up a little bit more often

1167
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,791
This is correct

1168
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:29,375
Highway patrol office software company

1169
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,167
Is how can we develop

1170
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,215
A software you know that

1171
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,543
To avoid the throwback on the battery lifetime

1172
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,311
Off

1173
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
Annies

1174
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,127
Improvement on the Bluetooth range

1175
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,199
And is a connected device company are you

1176
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:49,599
Predominantly making your money just from the sale of Hardware are you looking at other options I know a lot of smart home companies

1177
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,183
They're like we're going to sell the hardware but we're also going to

1178
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,487
I don't know magically build a Data Business

1179
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,279
Password krita subscription model

1180
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,839
So how do you think about being in the business of

1181
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:05,983
Operating something that is going to exist in a consumer's life for maybe five years or have to support it for that life cycle

1182
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:10,335
Ubi clearly focusing on the hardware and I think

1183
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,895
It's a question of pokerus because

1184
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,199
As mentioned before Mini

1185
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
Player

1186
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:21,599
Are disappointed with your result of the smart or medium of Hogan you in term of business

1187
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:27,231
And they trying one that tries to how do I have they tried to watch tonight it does not work so well

1188
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,279
Let's improve my business

1189
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,071
And moving to a doctor

1190
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,399
A substitution

1191
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,167
More than

1192
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,959
And the.

1193
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:40,031
If you player a successful so far

1194
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:43,359
On our side we are here for the long run

1195
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:48,223
And other told you before we can get apple homekit will be a winner

1196
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,503
On the long run

1197
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,527
And

1198
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,087
Aspect

1199
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,391
Ebenezer AAA is nuts

1200
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,695
A turkey for many consumer

1201
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,975
You really want

1202
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,559
Internal run and we are preparing this long-term asset

1203
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,351
And by

1204
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,631
Digital King

1205
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,447

1206
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471

1207
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,263
And oh by the way

1208
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,823
A seamless user experience

1209
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,359
Truck consumer

1210
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,407
This is where he's I want for Christmas

1211
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:22,527
And I'm going to assume that that's why you feel like you can compete with some of the

1212
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,319
Mega players that look like

1213
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,879
Are now in the smart home so you got Amazon who's

1214
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:30,975
Purchased ring has purchased Eero you've got Google which has there

1215
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:37,375
Best line of products in there are tons of others there's Arlo there's netatmo over in Europe that are all

1216
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,191
I'll try to compete against these guys even though they're smaller

1217
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,751
How do you view that competition and what difference

1218
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:47,615
If I look about some of their figure all that out official

1219
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:51,967
How about towards appear that you mention in the number of products sold

1220
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:58,111
Contrary to our story so far 750,000 connected products

1221
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,927
That's mean we will reach 1 million product

1222
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,207
By end of

1223
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,487

1224
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:07,327

00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
For what

1228
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,679
I've mentioned before

To the connected home

1234
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,687
And

1235
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,735
Why would I ever

1236
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
2

1237
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:29,599
Have such product that has such numbers and such poor

1238
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,903
Is because we are focusing

1239
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,695
Onza a political system

1240
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,023
And today is true well mostly

1241
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
People who buy out

1242
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,839
Product of a person

1243
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,911

End

1249
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,615
Is very high

1250
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,895

1251
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,175

We've got the security and data privacy

1257
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,695

1258
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,975
Hazel naked

1259

1261
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:18,495
Excellent so I have to ask because I live in a mixed household I have an Android Apple home

1262
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:22,335
What is your advice for people who want to use your products

1263
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,127
And apple homekit in a bit

1264
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:24,895
Mixed household

1265
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:30,271
So we have developed a product two years ago which is a button

1266
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,831
What gives you the opportunity to

1267
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,855
Cukor

1268
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,647
GE products

1269
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,719
Especially if you are on void user

1270
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,255
Okay so

1271
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
I get a button

1272
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,071
All right it is a beautiful button

1273
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,351
And I will say okay

1274
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,655
Thank you so much for

1275
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,215
For coming on the show I feel like I've learned a lot about Apple

1276
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,263
I won't count them out just yet

1277
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,031
End

1278
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:55,103
I am excited about better Bluetooth sensors coming

1279
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,127
Hopefully down the pike

1280
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,943
