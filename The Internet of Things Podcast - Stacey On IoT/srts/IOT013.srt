1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,984
Hey everybody this is the internet

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,264
The things podcast

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,824
Higginbotham and my co-host

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,104
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,944
Yay this week we have a lot of awesome stuff for you

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,992
Actually I shouldn't say that because

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,040
Restart on a pretty Grim topic

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,832
Which is the question of

9
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
If

10
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,368
If

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
Be smart home

12
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,416
Is crumbling

13
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,232
Are people still really into the Smart Home

14
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,280
We had a couple of news item

15
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
Recently

16
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,376
We had Leo which is a company that makes a smart light

17
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,912
Tired I don't even know how to do

18
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,472
Describe Leo actually it's it makes a smart night light

19
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,312
Also listens for your smoke detector to go off

20
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:50,176
And then it will text you if it goes off so it's kind of like a way to retrofit your smoke

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:50,944
Actors

22
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
It is also a night light

23
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760
Does that make sense

24
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
That makes sense

25
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Makes sense

26
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,600
It's interesting

27
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
It's like the Labradoodle

28
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
Gadgets

29
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,536
You just come by and some kind of random cool stuff and you get this

30
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,352
It's a nice Gadget I've actually tested it out

31
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,888
It's about a hundred bucks and

32
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,704
Yeah it's a it's a fun thing

33
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,752
Last week the company laid off

34
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,568
About 30% of its staff it was 16 people

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
And

36
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,152
I talk to the CEO and

37
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
Basically the issue is that the

38
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,552
The smart home is kind of getting there a little slower than anticipated

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,624
And they wanted to conserve their cash and they have

40
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,672
They raised 37 million info

41
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
Their pretty good

42
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
So we have that

43
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792
We also had

44
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,840
We talked about it in previous shows

45
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,168
The quirky was getting out of the making all products

46
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,216
Business and was selling

47
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
It's wink

48
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,800
Home automation Hub software in

49
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
Platform

50
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
And

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
I kind of like of the opinion that

52
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
The wink was not a crate

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,272
Platform the software is actually really good but the hardware just in

54
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
Was it just didn't work

55
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
And so

56
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:06,464
Taking those things plus a couple other instances for example there's a Smart Lock called Gucci

57
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,768
I don't know if you remember this cabinet lunchbox

58
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
2013

59
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
I do remember it

60
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,864
So it actually hasn't shipped

61
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,704
It was supposed to say It was supposed to ship in December of 2013

62
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,776
People are basically if you go look at the Twitter account

63
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
It's kind of sad there's this one

64
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,128
It's like one for a person who's having to handle at least

65
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
Say hey

66
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,968
I would not want to be that person

67
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
Yeah

68
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
That's Tuff

69
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
There's also plump which was a

70
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,184
Wifi-connected light switch the founders were actually cedia

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,976
The Trade Organization for kind of

72
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,048
Yeah I am home and install

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,864
They launched in 2013 in

74
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,680
They still haven't produced eras light switch yet

75
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
Still available

76
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
Pre-order they say they're going to ship it in

77
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,616
So there's like a lot of stuff happening here that kind of made me

78
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
Look and realize that

79
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Maybe it's time for a reckoning

80
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:05,088
Will you notice I think there's two things going on here one is a lot of companies and started to jumped in

81
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,184
And promised the world and I commend them for that cuz I I

82
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
Like a lot of these

83
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
Potential products

84
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
A lot of them haven't delivered yet

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
And

86
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
It's funny because I've said in the past

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,264
Smart Home Market is kind of moving so slow but in some respect between pretty quickly when you have all these companies jumping in with potential products

88
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
The last couple of years

89
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
The thing is

90
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
Promising the product is one thing

91
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,920
Implementing and delivering is another

92
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,016
And the market itself that with so many bigger companies getting in

93
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,344
Seems to be crowding out something small guys to the point where like

94
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,696
Who this product we promised sounded great when we launched it but now we're competing against

95
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
Ab&c here

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,144
This isn't going to fly we need to either retool rethink or or something here and so I think they get into the state of paralysis

97
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,472
And it looks to me like it's really just a lot of companies that

98
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,264
Didn't deliver timely enough

99
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,104
And we also have a lot of consolidation going on in this industry right now so

100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
I think it's those two things going on

101
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
I think building good Hardware is hard

102
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
We talked about that plenty

103
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
I also think there is

104
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
A lot

105
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Of

106
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
Poorly reviewed gear out there

107
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,488
And that makes people nervous and there was an artist inside study that

108
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
Came out last week

109
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
About

110
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,095
Demand for Smart Home Products is

111
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,167
Dropped 15% in the last

112
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
Year

113
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,007
So from May 2014 to now and then

114
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,823
It also showed some data in this is August

115
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Isn't

116
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,663
Counting actual sales their measuring things like

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,271
Reduce inventions on social media

118
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,063
But they actually

119
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,159
Got a pretty good track record of predicting what's going to do well so

120
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
That's why I'm actually mentioning it

121
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
And then

122
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
This week

123
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
Icontrol

124
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
Put out some data about the Smart Home

125
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,631
It is also worth kind of

126
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,703
Looking at in terms of like demand and who's buying a

127
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,751
Basically

128
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
It looks like

129
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,871
Younger people are much more likely to buy it in the age range of 25

130
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
234

131
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:09,503
Are likely over 50 about 50% of them are likely to purchase

132
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
A smart home service are connected appliances

133
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
Within the next 12 months

134
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Versus

135
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Consumers

136
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
What you say

137
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
About 31%

138
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,535
Would purchase a smart home service

139
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
And only 25%

140
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
Purchase a connected

141
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
Appliance

142
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,215
And across-the-board the percentages are

143
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
In the

144
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,567
Mid-thirties for everyone purchasing smart locks

145
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,919
Connected home cameras connected lighting and connected door locks or what they're measuring

146
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
So

147
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,039
It looks like if you get into this 25 to 34 age range

148
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
Which theater URI

149
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,159
Sorry to spell thank you appreciate that

150
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:55,583
So it looks like younger people are a little bit more willing to spend but even then only half of them

151
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,703
It looks like when they're willing to spend is is worth mentioning to because

152
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:05,823
It looks like people don't just like walked out to Best Buy and pick one of these kind of connected devices up

153
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Looks like May

154
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
They're waiting for

155
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,663
Events like the birth of a child or

156
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,455
Moving to a new home

157
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Yeah

158
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:19,135
Yeah it's it's also interesting to me in the eye control report on and we've hit these two topics before but it just want to highlight it since it's

159
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,951
Two major obstacles found in the study for

160
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Consumers

161
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,583
Privacy data concern 71% of consumers share the fear their personal information make it stolen

162
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
No surprise there

163
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
And this is

164
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
Big thing with me I can say no forever

165
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:37,311
Can your devices talk to each other 60% of the consumers wish their devices to a better job

166
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,663
A talking to one another to me it's it's a platform thing it's not just individual

167
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,759
Fragmented devices and hope that you got radios that talk and work with each other but not

168
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,063
And I think that bodes well for the

169
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:54,463
Cornhole platform makers we've talked about him getting the pass and how it's been slow but there's an example of a platform that will

170
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,047
Probably resolve that issue of Kenya devices talk to each other

171
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
Exactly

172
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
I will say another thing

173
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,983
Another concern of theirs is that smart home technology will have too many bugs

174
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,775
57%

175
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
People

176
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
Are worried about this

177
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
And you know what they are

178
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
Your home is a minutes

179
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Where you live at

180
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Where you at

181
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
Sleep

182
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,111
Affirm for new nights when we work I mean we can't have bugs in the home

183
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,463
Meropenem in ants and roaches

184
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,023
Know that we can have those either however

185
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
No we can't have

186
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,631
A broken smart home that needs to reboot every year

187
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
3 hours

188
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,703
Yeah you want to relax you want I mean

189
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
Yeah it's it's a basic thing

190
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:45,407
Your lights to turn on a mean I even get frustrated with Netflix if I'm if I'm trying to watch TV and I'm like

191
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
You know it's like

192
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Oh

193
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
He must detect the internet is working

194
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
Oh I'm connected to the internet

195
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
Now

196
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,623
Who's watching I mean like all these steps and you're like

197
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,183
Just want to watch Netflix just want to see the movie

198
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
So I can so I

199
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
See that by the way

200
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
The entertainment

201
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,327
Internet Security in the eye control

202
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
Survey is the

203
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:09,727
90% of people buy a smart home for security so they're they're emphasizing that as they would

204
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
Icontrol

205
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Provides

206
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
The backend smart home software for

207
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
Comcast for

208
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
ATT

209
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
For a lot of

210
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
What is so security is one of

211
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Selling point

212
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
Entertainment is the other

213
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,087
And people are ready

214
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,439
To connect their entertainment rooms first followed by the kitchen

215
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
And let's see

216
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
I'm trying to think what was

217
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
What was the other thing

218
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
And then the bedroom for a second there I thought it was the bathroom

219
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
Smart bathroom

220
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
It's not there

221
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Percent of people are in

222
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
Connecting their bath

223
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Yes

224
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,663
I really don't need my toilet to tweet every time I use it

225
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
Oh Noah needs that

226
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,039
I would say actually I have speakers in my bathroom a lot of

227
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
Smart sales

228
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
Good lighting

229
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,671
Those are all very very nice to have but

230
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
Certainly.

231
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
So

232
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
That is kind of

233
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
Where people are in the Smart Home

234
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
Tom and

235
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
I think

236
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,143
If you can serve your cash

237
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
You're putting out a good product

238
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
And

239
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,799
You know you're in it for the long haul I think that's probably the way to go

240
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
And

241
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,199
God help us please let's get some smart platform just like let's get things talking to each other in a real

242
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
Easy-to-use way

243
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
So there's our learnings from that

244
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:33,439
We should talk because last last week we recorded before nest made there

245
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,023
Huge announcement

246
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Siri announce

247
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
But we'll go with Kevin and

248
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
Your sarcasm

249
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Kevin

250
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,983
Shall we shall we briefly cover what Nest covered

251
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,127
Version 1.01 of nest

252
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
It's getting a software upgrade

253
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
There's a brand new Nest protect

254
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
Smoke detector

255
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
And

256
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
There is a

257
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
Brand new

258
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
It's now the nest

259
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Scam

260
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Nest

261
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
Cam with a

262
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Capital c

263
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
Instead of the Dropcam

264
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
Which

265
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,375
This condo at this looks The Nest cam looks a lot like the Dropcam

266
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
Ampro

267
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,727
Two hundred bucks

268
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
Yeah

269
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,823
The Nest protect is still at a hundred bucks

270
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
And

271
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
You know the nest thermostat is 250

272
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:30,015
I will eagerly await my software update I'm really glad that they did not introduce a new nest

273
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,063
Turn Nest Thermostat because I'd hate to

274
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
After ripped mine out of the wall

275
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Yay 4th Avenue

276
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,767
Who I expected more boo boo

277
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,071
I know we have rumors of audio

278
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
We had

279
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,703
Like some sort of home audio entertainment product we had rumors of voice control

280
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
We had some great room

281
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,055
Rumors aside I mean really

282
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
This nest

283
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,943
When was when did Google buy nest for 3.2 billion January

284
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
Okay so you're in a half ago

285
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
And what's really happened since then

286
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
Not much

287
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
I got a check when

288
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Nest

289
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
Best spotter Google bypass

290
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:18,655
No not much has happened and the features they have in these things are not

291
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
Rocket science they're not like

292
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Daunting

293
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,031
Especially in the camera side they're not

294
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
We should get ahead of the cops

295
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Petition

296
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
It was January twenty

297
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Audio

298
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
Sonesse was a big

299
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Kind of

300
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,951
The biggest the biggest thing and we'll probably talk about it on another show cuz I'm

301
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
Planning this

302
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
Crazy idea

303
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
The

304
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,607
Announce that American family which is an insurance company

305
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
And Liberty Mutual

306
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
Are going to subsidize the nest

307
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
To protect

308
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,287
And give it out to homeowners as a way to like

309
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,615
Help prevent fire damage in homes in hopefully

310
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Lower

311
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,455
The incidence of payouts for fire damage

312
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,783
And if you do that you get a free Nest protect

313
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:12,927
From your insurance company and you also if you send them monthly data reports you'll get 5% off

314
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
Nice

315
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
So cats in

316
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:20,351
For American family which is the only one that offers this program now and it's only offered in Minnesota right

317
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Right now

318
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,727
You can actually staff discounts so your security alarm discount that you might get

319
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,847
Say to get 5% off each month format and then you can get 5% off for the nest

320
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Defender like woohoo

321
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
That's good deal good deal

322
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
So

323
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
However

324
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
It's still not that exciting

325
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
So

326
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
On the really exciting energy

327
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
The front we have this awesome

328
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
New Gadget

329
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,023
And I talked to these guys a couple of months ago they're based in Austin

330
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,863
I've been super excited wanted to tell you guys about it it's a product called curb

331
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
And

332
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,471
You install it in your circuit breaker box

333
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
Is it a circuit breaker

334
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,359
So you like the box with Breakers

335
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Open

336
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,967
And if you don't actually install it an electrician install

337
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
What you can

338
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
Do with this is amazing

339
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
You get to see

340
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,135
On a device level

341
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,439
How much energy something is

342
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,255
Is consuming in your house in real time like

343
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
I sat through the demo in

344
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,727
He remotely turned out he had it installed in his home the CEO had it installed in his home and he remotely turned on a space heater

345
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,543
And you could see the graph in the kilowatt hours

346
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
Soon to go up

347
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Like

348
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
I can't remember.

349
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
It turned red in light

350
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
The numbers got a lot bigger in

351
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:44,063
He's like sea based on this you know the space heater just turning it on for like a

352
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,855
8 hours a day would cost me

353
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
$5 a

354
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
$5

355
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
It was

356
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,279
Amazing DD

357
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
App is very

358
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,119
Compelling it's it's very easy to read

359
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
It's currently hard for me to talk about

360
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
.

361
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:07,103
So I'm going to say in a personal level I am super enthusiastic about this

362
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,199
Because I have tried to do this in the past with the

363
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
Kilowatt meter so I don't know if you

364
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
No those are actually kind of like

365
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Smart

366
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,671
Smart Meters that can determine how much juice is flowing through a particular Outlet

367
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
The curb does it at the

368
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
The circuit level so

369
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
Guess

370
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,583
Pair multiple things on a circuit you're actually

371
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,655
If you can break it down to those individual things

372
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
But that's okay

373
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,263
You can break it down I mean it depends on how your house is

374
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
Yes yes

375
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,151
And that makes total sense but so so the kilowatt that I used to use a couple years ago

376
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
You know that was

377
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Literally just

378
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
Measure 1 Outlet the

379
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
Outflow of energy

380
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
1 Outlet

381
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
This can do at 3

382
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Full House

383
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Which I love

384
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,951
Part of the reason I love that is because I have 41 solar panels on my roof

385
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:59,327
I can tell you to the second how much energy each panel is producing

386
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,607
Because

387
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,679
Every one of the panels as a microinverter and its shares

388
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:10,079
Data over power line to a little web server have running and so when I get historical information real-time data yada yada

389
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
Thing is I don't know how much energy I'm

390
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
Assuming

391
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
Steve

392
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
For my monthly Electric

393
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Bill

394
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
Since I am

395
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
I'm still tied to the grid

396
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,599
And I can't reconcile it really on a device level

397
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
So this is

398
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
I think I'll standing

399
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
For someone who really wants to

400
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,511
Get a feel for the energy consumption in the house

401
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
I agree in

402
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,119
Another reason I think you would be such an interesting candidate for this

403
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
Solar is the top reason

404
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
But the other is you got

405
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
A fold or lease

406
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Hypervolt

407
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,823
So you can actually calculate even

408
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,407
Better your Energy savings because when you plug your car in

409
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,479
You can see exactly how much

410
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,039
How much it cost to charge your car so

411
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,879
The CEO sent me some data from someone in Austin who has

412
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Two Teslas

413
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Lucky man

414
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
He's got a roadster and an s

415
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,791
The one week.

416
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
You know that he tracked it

417
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
His car is cost him

418
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,679
$27 a little over $27

419
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
To charge

420
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
So

421
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,519
That's that's a week's worth of

422
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Charging

423
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Are those things

424
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
That's pretty impressive in

425
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,943
That's how she's amazing data cuz you can start seeing like

426
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
Is it time to replace my fridge because

427
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,343
She's assisting cost me a hundred bucks a month to you

428
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,927
Yeah the the electric-car bit

429
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,743
It's actually not that impressive tomato I'll tell you why

430
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,583
Because unlike a lightbulb

431
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
Or some other device

432
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
There's a fixed amount of energy a car can

433
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:45,567
Can take can consume and I know the capacity of the battery in my Volkswagen Atlas

434
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,871
Bass Elite 13 kilowatt hour battery

435
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
So

436
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
I can just multiply my

437
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
Hourly

438
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
Usage rate

439
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,831
To figure out how long that is it's about a buck and a half for me I know it is on a daily basis

440
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
It a little bit

441
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
You know

442
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,439
Beneficial to me for the variable type things

443
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,791
Okay I would love this before I put in do you know my

444
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:10,399
My Ness and that's where it's at my Nest my ecobee my LED lights because

445
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
Actually have a sense of

446
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,335
Am I saving money or am I just you know installing $250 thermostats just for fun

447
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Yep

448
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,711
We probably both it's a little bit of both because I keep my house at an ungodly Hi-Tech

449
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
Temperature

450
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
So

451
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,367
Speaking of savings we should get to the downside of

452
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,927
Which is this thing is very

453
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
It is

454
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,279
It is the devices on Indiegogo

455
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
Right now you can pre-order it

456
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Indiegogo

457
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
And it will ship in September

458
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
4

459
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:47,263
One one unit is $350 and that measure 16

460
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
Different

461
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Circuits

462
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
18

463
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,103
Centers $0.18

464
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:55,199
16 zones of appliances what it says

465
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
649

466
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
Which in my house I actually

467
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Three of these

468
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
And then there's also the charge

469
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,463
For the electrician to install it

470
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Which

471
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
They're trying to

472
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,327
Current that the guys at Kerber trying to make it so

473
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,167
Still have a network of installers that will pay a set fee

474
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
Right now

475
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,031
They haven't got that in place so he estimates about a hundred

476
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
$250 for one

477
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,943
Eventually he'd like to be $100 for one and a hundred fifty for the two pack

478
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
We'll see

479
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,295
I am getting one in my house

480
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
So I'm going to be

481
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,903
I feel like maybe I should have them send it to you Kevin because

482
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,231
With a solar you're like way more compelling

483
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
That's up to you

484
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:46,911
I bet I'll let you decide how it looks like there app is available for IOS and Android so that's a good sign

485
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
And

486
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
Yeah looks pretty good

487
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,055
Yeah so that's our excited that's our exciting thing on curb

488
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,871
Indiegogo is doing super well

489
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,711
I think I've been there they're so close to getting there

490
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
There they're raising 25000

491
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Ed

492
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
23000

493
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:11,231
I'll tell you guys a secret there shipping in September because I already producing these

494
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
So

495
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,303
It's it's a little less produce safe

496
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
Yeah it's a little less

497
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:20,447
Yeah and in the end plan is probably to go install this in

498
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
Like talk to

499
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,799
Solar power cup like when you're getting your solar installed

500
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:31,199
It's a perfect match for that absolutely

501
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,503
They're doing because they've got a smart home initiative

502
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
You know just

503
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,831
Pop in the sky in here cuz you can amortize it with

504
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
House

505
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
French

506
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,047
As expensive as it is I think I could get started with the early adopter package at 309 and that's

507
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,887
A tenth of the price of a Tesla battery that I actually reserved

508
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,423
So to me it's

509
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,751
Probably worth the 309 if I get an early I might I might

510
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
I guess talk to my wife

511
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
Oh

512
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,663
You know what this was the 309 wasn't actually available

513
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
They must have opened up some more

514
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,271
Early doctor either so there's a few left

515
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Yeah okay

516
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,647
It's okay

517
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,231
Yeah and in the large home there's a two pack for 5:49

518
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,863
It just to clarify the reason you would need the 2Pac is because

519
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
You have two circuit breakers

520
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
Actually have three circuit

521
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,495
My house is very

522
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,519
Overachiever

523
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,591
What my house was wired for the future

524
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,127
Yes so

525
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,663
So when we built it

526
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,199
2 years ago that's that was our

527
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
Thought process

528
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,039
So you know what yes we are overachievers

529
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
But

530
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,903
That's I also going to get really granular data when I am

531
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
Does pops away with

532
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
So I can I can tell you how much

533
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
My washing machine

534
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,047
I can't wait y'all

535
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
Okay

536
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
Moving right along

537
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
2

538
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Arnex picked

539
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
Snooze

540
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
Which is

541
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,983
Amazon Echo

542
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,543
Oh I thought you're going to do your echo echo

543
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
Echo echo

544
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
I would but I'm a little peeved

545
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,759
That means it's good news let's just say what the news is Amazon Echo is available to everyone

546
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,575
For 179 99 you don't need an invite

547
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,391
And I believe July 14th is when they're in stock

548
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
Ship July 4th

549
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:22,048
Yeah so as we all know I passed on the echo.for $99 and you

550
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,608
Got one for $99 as a Prime member

551
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,728
I later said on this very show I think I'm going to reserve one again and I did for 149

552
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Well

553
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:36,128
I never got the 149 invite and now I've got to pay 17999

554
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,456
Sometimes it pays to be a believer

555
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,808
Yeah we we should say that this is going to be today's 5 minutes

556
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,368
Yes Papa

557
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
Because

558
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Because I think

559
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
Now that anyone can buy it at

560
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
Reply

561
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,840
If you were unlucky like Avenue

562
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,888
You would have gotten it but now you can go buy it

563
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,680
180 bucks

564
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
So

565
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,752
Okay for those of you guys who

566
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,336
Have not heard us talk again and again about the echo this is a

567
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,384
This is basically Siri combined with a

568
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
So

569
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
You talk to it

570
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
And

571
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,832
Is connected to the Bing search engine is connected to a lot of other things

572
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,904
And you tell it what you wanted to do or you ask it a question

573
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
And

574
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
10

575
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
A response

576
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,512
Set also plays music at axes like a

577
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,304
Bluetooth speaker with your phone

578
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
What else does it do

579
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:32,960
Well they've added a bunch of things like a lot of content I got to Pandora

580
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,776
And I could always read you the news from NPR

581
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,056
I wouldn't have the timer

582
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,360
Timer so and

583
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,456
So so in the last so when it launched it was basically

584
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,856
Connected to being so you can talk to it ask us some questions it would tell you casket jokes it have the timer

585
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
And then it also had

586
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,952
Amazon music search

587
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,768
Write a Prime music Amazon Prime

588
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,352
So it could play you could be like Alexa play Taylor Swift

589
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
And it would play Taylor Swift

590
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,448
If you happen to have that album in your pregnant

591
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
In

592
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
You know what for 99 bucks

593
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
Set the time

594
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
I thought it was a joy

595
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,408
A joy to use it was wonderful to talk to is the most effective

596
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,736
Kind of natural language translation service I really encounter

597
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,784
It was really it's really very good

598
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,600
But it was such a limited

599
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
I did nothing

600
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,416
He wanted to tell it to do things

601
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:30,816
But they did change that in February this off I think it came out in November and February they said we've got a

602
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:36,448
Early SDK for developers and I started to add some things and they later added

603
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,520
Smartphone type things such as Philips hue light support

604
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
WeMo support

605
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Couple of things

606
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
It's this and that

607
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,432
Fort for select services

608
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,040
So long with all the home automation stuff it's also added things like the ability to

609
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,600
Read your audible books and

610
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:58,208
You know you could always do things like add stuff to your grocery list and now you're just

611
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,512
You're basically saying it over all expansion

612
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
So

613
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
The question is

614
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,680
Who should spend $180 getting a

615
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
$449 to Yuan

616
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:16,896
But that's another story are not doing that deal okay I retract the question

617
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,688
Not if I have a question

618
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:23,040
I still would like to see it have things more Integrations with Spotify

619
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
I want to give it

620
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,112
More commands in my home

621
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,952
I can already talk to my house like my thermostats using

622
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,792
I'd like the nest thermostat I can use Google but

623
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,144
My husband and I both use the Ability we tell Alexa to turn off her lights

624
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
Every night

625
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,288
You also have with the device a remote control that you can use

626
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
To speak into

627
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
For when you're far away

628
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,152
Or at the room is too loud

629
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
And we use that a lot too

630
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,760
I personally might buy another Echo

631
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
Go actually for upstairs

632
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
That's how much I like

633
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,624
Yeah

634
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,976
There's a lot to like here in a minute because they've expanded what it can do I was not

635
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,024
I didn't want to spend $99 at the

636
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,328
The time because it was very limited in my opinion

637
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,656
The funny thing is I just talked to my family about this

638
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:17,056
And I said you know if I get this you guys going to use it and even after watching the video which has been updated to show

639
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,336
All the different things you can do now

640
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,152
They're like probably not so

641
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:25,504
Surprisingly I would be the only one who would theoretically use it according to them

642
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,344
So I don't know if I'm going to do it especially having to pay $30 more

643
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:35,744
I don't know I have a lot of other things I can talk to and do things with such as my phone one of my watches and so on

644
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,816
I like how it's all integrated into one device

645
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
But

646
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,680
It does duplicate a lot of things I can already do

647
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,240
But it does them so well

648
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,080
My family didn't think they would use it

649
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,896
But I think we probably

650
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
And I don't have soap

651
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,248
It is a no-brainer if you have a huge music collection

652
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
Turn on Amazon

653
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,576
On Amazon which we do not

654
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,624
We do not either so but I will say to

655
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
Two people who do

656
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,184
This device

657
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Will be amazing

658
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,256
Because you basically just tell it what you want

659
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,560
And it plays it in the sound quality is pretty

660
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,400
It's its equivalent with like a jam box or something

661
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
So

662
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,264
But that aside my husband didn't think he'd use it

663
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,800
But again he uses it every night

664
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,616
We actually use it at the dinner table to settle like

665
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Debates

666
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,944
Who is president in

667
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,248
Oh you should ask it who was president in

668
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,528
1841

669
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,064
Because that is

670
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,624
Secret Pop Quiz question and you will be surprised

671
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Put that there

672
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,768
I'm thinking but I don't know

673
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,560
That's all I know

674
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
So

675
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
I think you should spend the money

676
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
If

677
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,448
If you have actually Hue Lights you should see

678
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:54,336
We've actually set it up so when you tell it to play music are Hue Lights in the living room flash on and off

679
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,152
I didn't see the color circle

680
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
Which is fine

681
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,224
So my advice

682
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
If you have music

683
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
On Amazon

684
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
Prime

685
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,624
Amazon yeah Amazon Prime music service

686
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
If you have

687
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,464
Connected lights that are Hue or WeMo enabled

688
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,512
And if you

689
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,864
What are elected like you're very excited about voice-activated technology

690
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,656
This is an easy

691
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
Easy Spanish

692
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,984
And it's actually relatively low cost

693
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,800
When you think about what it does do for you so that's fair

694
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,824
What's gravity group

695
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,384
And I use the kitchen timer part of it all the time

696
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:33,760
Everything I have plenty of other timers but it's very nice just to be like hey Alexa set a timer for 15 minutes

697
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,320
Or hey Alexa what time is it

698
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,136
Everybody's if you have one right now it's going off

699
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,952
Sorry y'all okay

700
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,744
So I think that that

701
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,304
Covers Us for this week that's a lot of news

702
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
And

703
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,376
So please

704
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
Stay tuned

To rent

708
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
Cameras

709
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
Drones and wearables

710
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:05,760
I'm going to talk about some surprising data that lumoid has to offer people about werewolves and where they met

711
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:11,392
Donuts

712

Who is the CEO of

715
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Lumoid

Healthy

717
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,728
Hi sweetie thanks for having me here

I am super excited

719
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,848
Because you get to live the dream you're living the dream man

720
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
You have

721
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
Resume Lloyd

722
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,736
A platform where people can rent gadgets and try them out

723
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,760
Is that

724
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
Fair way of saying it

725
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,904
Yes that's exactly right I am living the dream I am a gadget nerd and

726
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,720
Everyday eyeshadow look at work and I get to

00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,536
Working for you this all kinds of really cool

728
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,912
This is pretty much what I wanted to be when I grew up

729
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,216
Why does a try before you buy service

730
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
For electronic

731
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
Wevent

732
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,872
Spell all kinds of gadgets we started with Photo & Video gear

733
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,968
Cameras lenses psychological to things like that

734
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
And then expanded into Jones

735
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,344
Angles of taking off is doing really well no pun intended

We have Apple watch in the face

740
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
A whole bunch of other variables

And we have a great time for you by thermostat lock him up

742
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,032
Yikes it sounds awesome and I have to ask

743
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Because

744
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:37,408
I am in the enviable position of getting a lot of review gadgets for my my smartphone

745
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
Stuff

746
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:42,528
But I know a lot of people out there especially if people listen to the show or probably like

747
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Hey

748
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,880
Are you guys going to go go into some of the smart home devices

00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,840
Okay well

751
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,400
That that'll be really exciting I know that

752
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,960
Friends of mine abused actually the site to rent photo

Before a big trip

759
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,064
Or an event

760
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:22,208
This is actually really good way to do it I know several journalists who've done this before they've covered stories in that sort of

761
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
So

762
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,048
We're mostly concerned about your wearable stuff

763
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
Because

764
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
In addition to like

765
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,888
Having the stuff in the business line

766
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
You are also a dataset

767
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,008
And your prior company trueandco

768
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,056
Which I have also used

769
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,640
Was a kind of an online retailer meets offline retailing for

770
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,664
Surprise

771
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,736
And you actually sent people bras out to try

772
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
And

773
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,064
Gather data on what bras

774
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,856
Actually gather fit data for them

775
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,392
Then you sent the prize out for

776
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
And then

777
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
You guys

778
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Kind of track

779
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,560
What people actually kept from the ones that you sent to them

780
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,864
And then felt even bigger and better profiles

781
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,936
So how does that attention towards data kind of

782
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,496
How does that influence what you're doing it live

783
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,592
When I was doing so I went off the coupon first air

784
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,640
My job was to go

785
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,712
M14 pinyin online

786
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,760
One of the things that the exact blood

787
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,088
The entire world was going from

788
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,416
Physical retail stores and online say the same

789
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
But people still wanted

790
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,280
Chest and touching feeling

791
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,352
Actually try out items before they committed to buying them

792
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:37,984
The try before you buy was a no-brainer that worked out really well

793
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,824
Anthony spark needed even more interesting and useful on both sides

794
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,152
And so far as the story by

795
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:51,808
Is something that we tested before and it's worked really well and in the age of consumer electronics

796
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:56,160
Now you're seeing Manufacturing moralistic

797
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:01,280
And Scott is getting into manufactured and used in Kickstarter campaign

798
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,864
Just lots and lots of manufacturing Innovation happening

799
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,168
And the net result here is that

800
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,472
Are many many options to try

801
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,288
But there is no way for you to test drive in

802
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,824
In the comfort of your home

803
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:18,432
Unless you was deciding to pay full price

804
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,712
Awesome so

805
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
What I'm seeing like

806
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,552
Right now you've got like a runner's kid on the site

807
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:30,208
And let see in that as the Fitbit charge HR the Garmin vivosmart the Jawbone UP24 in the street

808
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
Fusion

809
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,072
That's poor and I get this for like a week and it cost me

810
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,376
It looks like $25 is what this cost

811
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:41,728
Do weed work if you get to either pick a kid

812
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,824
You want to measure

813
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:50,176
We also have these fun little kids like things like that

814
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:53,760
If you'll fit into one of these please set aside

815
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,600
Buckets of what kind of credible person you are

816
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:01,440
You can get the kids or you can pick and choose up to five items

817
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,256
And it's all on the cartwrights and you can add the

818
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
Winter Park

819
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
Try them out for two weeks

820
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,424
Whenever you decide at the end of two weeks when you decide which one

821
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,704
Is the best for you

822
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
Everyday commands

823
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,520
Workout with me

824
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,312
You're really bad at context

825
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,968
And at the end of the lease once you decided which one

826
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,992
The best for you

827
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,808
Will send you a brand-new one of your choice

828
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
And that

829
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,112
Price of judicially pig

830
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,648
$25

831
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,720
And then it goes up as you get more expensive devices

832
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,280
That goes towards the purchase of the item

833
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:41,376
You also have a really interesting gender split on the wearable side

834
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,264
I think four for most of your product so for the drones you have drones and photography are your other two section

835
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,848
And those it looks like they're about 74% male

836
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:54,432
Yeah and that's what's the interesting part

837
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,992
The most exciting part

838
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,552
Monday-saturday photo video gear

839
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,576
And then you find it

840
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
Drones

841
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,232
Retracted gender split and for the longest time

842
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,024
26 virgin female

843
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,816
Launch printable

844
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:14,912
And Parabola is volume 59%

845
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,984
Answer me that was incredibly surprising because

846
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:23,104
The perception that you see in mainstream media that gravel dissolve used by men

847
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,432
It's cheetah to understand the sizes are good chords

848
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,992
Pragmatism

849
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,296
By the people who are actually using this

850
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:36,928
Happened to be more female than men

851
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,488
And you'll have a coordinated dance

852
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
+ 4

853
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:47,936
Most marathons 60% to 55%

854
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,216
And 42

855
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,080
McCormick's very well with back pain

856
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:59,200
Yeah I wonder if that's because women are more likely to want to try or if we're just more active

857
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
For we just care about having

858
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,272
Stats I don't know

859
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:12,768
2 months ago and you've been tracking it initially we just thought it was an anomaly

860
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,096
And maybe decorated falling out the crib

861
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,912
I've been excited reaching out to the customers and

862
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:22,752
The more we cleaned up the green Adam RV rental

863
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
Define

864
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,896
It's actually true and you know

865
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:33,760
Kind of different from the rest of consumer electronics has how the perception is

866
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,064
It's much more females are there

867
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:40,928
And we should be able to just conference play one of the speakers at the same thing they were like

868
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,464
Our customers are

869
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,744
Mostly female

870
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,328
Largest airplane

871
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,888
And I think this is something that we go

872
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,472
We started telling manufacturer Partners to

873
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:57,568
You need to take notice there's a lot

874
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
Maui now

875
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,688
Not sure if that's how you're confusing it but that's ardida

876
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:06,528
And it might be helpful for you to keep that in mind for your next version of the

877
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
Oh that just means more people

878
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,368
That's

879
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:14,208
Unfortunately that's that's what what I've experienced so far in the gadget world

880
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
Let's put some pink on it

881
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,280
You also have the

882
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,560
The Apple watch

883
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,328
Twitch

884
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
Is

885
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
Ghetto super hot

886
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
And it says I think I can

887
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,704
You got a wait list of over 4000 people

888
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,984
The train

889
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,288
How many watches do you have

890
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
And then

891
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
How many will how many Apple watches

892
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
Do you have

893
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,200
Right now we have a little over a hundred units

894
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,736
Apple watches and

895
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:41,344
Is it Rangers I mean we have most of what we have are

896
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,416
Apple watch it tells we have about

897
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,208
25 units

898
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,256
Get much more expensive and

899
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,304
People want to castrate them

900
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,888
But did you for trying out the sport edition

901
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,472
Because that's the one big injector Toyota Venza

902
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:01,312
OKC $350

903
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,872
It's a compliment to my phone I can see myself

904
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
Music in Paris

905
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,688
Inside out

906
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
Hibbett Sports

907
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,552
Waiting to drink only water

908
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:16,160
Did you work with apple to get those or did you just go buy them up on the site that night

909
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,952
We just went and bought them

910
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,024
Okay so now puts of the wearables

911
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:27,168
You mentioned sharing data with some of the manufacturer is so do you have Partnerships with those manufacturers

912
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:33,824
We do with the manufacturers we have Partnerships and now that you're moving thousands of units

913
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,664
Manufacturers are coming out and talking to us that's been denied Spark

914
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,248
And so now he's established on the timer

915
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,064
Ice dragon

916
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
Bunch of these companies

917
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,416
And more new ones I think you're doing it please

918
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,464
Jodeci Partnerships

919
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,024
And that's been taking off Julie and

920
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:57,888
Okay and I can see the rental market for photography being a great sandal in business

921
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,216
But it sounds like on the wearable side it's really like

922
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
Hopefully I passed

923
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
2 conversion

924
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,824
I don't see a lot of people thinking of man I really need a

925
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,848
Fitbit for a week

926
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,128
It's kind of like

927
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,200
It's more of a try-before-you-buy as opposed to like

928
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,016
A drone to do a project or something

929
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,368
What are the percent of people are percent of purchases people who convert

930
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,184
Parables

931
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,512
Nearly every other customer

932
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,816
About 50% in conversion

933
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
Nice

934
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:31,424
And it sounds like the most popular wearables are the Garmin Vivo

935
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,520
Vivosmart the Jawbone UP24 in the whiting's pulse O2

936
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:42,432
That's the most popular to try but it looks like the ones that are most popular buyer a little bit different to jawbone up 24 in

937
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
Garmin vivosmart are both on that list

938
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,576
The most popular one to buy is actually the Fitbit charge HR

939
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,672
Fitbit charge HR

940
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,488
Beacon off

941
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
One eye tearing paper

942
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,656
Think about it and book

943
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,728
Did I think there's this whole section of people who just sang

944
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,264
Bible verses

945
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,312
Exercising to come and go

946
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,848
It's not going to stick it out

947
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,920
Well yeah there's Apple watch that everyone else is going to feel

948
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,480
I think the signing but I do know has like

949
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,528
Making these people

950
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,624
Gravity Auto Sales and the margin that they

951
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,416
There's Something About This variables

952
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
I want to try it

953
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:30,816
Take me to Thai Chili has started doing a really good job with marketing then I need monkey the app

954
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,168
I think they sponsored The Amazing Race recently

955
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:40,032
And you can eat a lot of that happening and I think that

956
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,056
How much

957
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
What do you get

958
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
From something like

959
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,432
Yeah mean initially

960
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:51,296
Much bigger issue when he started the total video.

961
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,856
Initially

962
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:58,208
But you know we started looking at what other companies like Airbnb

963
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
Square

964
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,536
PayPal login companies

965
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,608
We started using the thinking to BPI 50 you

966
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,680
We have our own so I could think to mention theme

967
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:13,312
Do you that only took them to understand what are the odds of the person committing charge is

968
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:17,408
Everybody every

969
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,224
Determine whether we shared.

970
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,552
Should we take a refundable deposit for some customers

971
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,832
Are incapable

972
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,856
No

973
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,672
Sixty-five 70% of our customers we don't have any

974
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,696
Deposited

975
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,512
Dave Franco

976
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,304
And being able to shut the box

977
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,376
I like you can always send a drone to hunt them down

978
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,192
I'm imagining you have this huge Warehouse

979
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,848
We do I think we have the largest Native John's in San Francisco

980
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:50,944
Right now we have 74 so Jones just sitting here in Texas

981
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,480
But what's your favorite drones

982
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
Since I'm assume you've tried the

983
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,344
DJI Inspire 1

984
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,672
Beautiful 4K video

985
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,000
And you know what

986
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,888
I think I did it again

987
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:14,240
$20 to replace

988
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:17,056
But the doors are locked and the video for kids

989
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:21,152
Awesome but what is your favorite Will Blast your favorites in all categories

990
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,432
So what's your favorite

991
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
Photography

992
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:28,576
I'll get the year I used to shoot with Canon by mechanic

993
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,368

994
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:37,792

Ridiculous

997
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,360
Now it's just

998
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,151
Did you send such a good job

999
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,943
Jason Stryker

1000
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711

Iran economy

1004
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,207
Vivosmart

1005
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,743
I like it alot

1006
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:11,839
I don't know if anybody else on my team like it but I'm trying to convert them

1007
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
I'm a gunner

1008
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:17,215
I really like the Garmin vivosmart executive drinks with the connector

1009
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,823
Apple watch

1010
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,847

1011
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,383
How to play Candy Apple watch

Battery for my phone

1013
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:32,575
Take me to an iPhone 6 Plus gesture that I get more battery life

1014
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
Engraved everything

1015
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,391
But I'm trying to

1016
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:40,255
You know it's getting better

1017
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,303
See I was looking through and I was actually

1018
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,327
Kind of tempted by the

1019
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,375
The Fitbit Aria smart scale

1020
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,935
But I thought maybe I don't really want to nobody

1021
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215
Body fat

1022
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:49,983
Percentage

1023
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,799
Everyday I have it every day to Rio

1024
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,871
Halloween scale in the office and I have one at home

1025
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:02,527
This is basically what we do it's a lot of fun and it's a lot of numbers

1026
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,111
And it's everything is all Quantified Self and

1027
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
I love it

1028
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,047
Slice of pizza

1029
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,631
And I having everything at Islanders we have a blood pressure monitor

1030
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,167
This is a lot of fun

1031
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,471
And I'm sorry but

1032
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,799
It just has to have all these gadgets with her

1033
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
So I

1034
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,639
I am totally with you I love having gadgets just for the

1035
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
The sake of God

1036
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,687
Get some things to play with

1037
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,295
You know because you have your expertise and data I'm curious

1038
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,879
You got you mentioned that you haven't you've just kind of started to do stuff with

1039
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
Set the data

1040
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,927
But just

1041
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:46,303
As you're playing with this stuff do see this is more a toy and fun for you or do you really see like

1042
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
Life changing

1043
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
Potential here

1044
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,935
Is it just kind of like oh it's a fun thing for people who are well and

1045
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,751
Can into that sort of thing or do you think this is really something

1046
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,775
Change

1047
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,799
Healthcare

1048
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,383
You need to have the mindset of the perspective about

1049
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,199
How healthy or unhealthy you want to be

1050
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,527
And use the wearable with a way to stop dementia life.

1051
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,087
I think a lot of people

1052
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,111
Once I get

1053
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,159
This particular wearable

1054
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:16,511

Skinbetter

1058
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,935
That's not how it was

1059
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:30,079
You can't expect everything to change just because you have you noticed watch on you

1060
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,151
And I feel a lot of people trying to do that continually

1061
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,735
And I almost want to tell them what what did you expect

1062
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
