A unified

Identity management

System for the king

36
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,192

Trey over a million people use the ring video doorbell 2 help

44
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
Protect their hosts

Ringo's

46
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
Home security begins at the front door but it doesn't end there so now they've extended that same level of security to the rest of your home

47
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
The ring floodlight

48
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,976
Just like the doorbell

49
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
Floodlight cam is a motion-activated camera and floodlight that connects right to your phone with HD video and 2-way audio

50
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,704
It lets you know the moment anyone steps on your property

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,032
Which is a handy feature of these doorbell

52
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,360
I know cuz I tested the ring doorbell I enjoyed

53
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,664
How quickly was how responsive it was

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,016
And it was super fun actually to watch my kid when she would leave wave at me

55
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,576
As she walked out the door while I was traveling

56
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,416
So you two can see and speak to visitors and even set an alarm right

57
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,696

Kids are almost too old for this story but I was really excited

68
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
To see that Madame a is

69
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
Going to get a

The Toy Fair

You guys

74
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,720
Before Kevin tells you what he thinks

75
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
You know me so well

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,864
Because toy fair is awesome I went

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
A couple years ago

78
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
And I was

79
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,704
Prepared for like high-tech toys

80
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
I was not

81
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,776
Prepared for what toy fair actually is

82
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
It is like

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
Soulmate dolls

84
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Stuffed animal

85
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,712
Very low text at the high-tech stuff was actually pretty relegated to just a few

86
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,248
100 square feet in the Javits

87
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
Vengeance

88
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
So it was in 2014

89
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,856
So very low tech industry

90
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
Trying to get

91
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
More high-tech

92
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
And they're doing it with matinee

93
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Kevin your thoughts

94
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280
Well

95
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
I mean I think there's there's Merit in some of these things like there's some interesting trivia type games and box games that

96
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
Add some smarts

97
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,080
But for the younger crowd I just worried about

98
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,872
They always listening type

99
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:33,760
Microphone stuff and kids privacy we seen so many connected toys for this has been an issue

100
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,576
Those were smaller companies Amazon

101
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:41,696
Maybe they were protecting their databases and servers and so on as much as Amazon does but still

102
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
I went a little when I hear about

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
And to be fair these are companies like Mattel and Hasbro building the sin

104
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
Using Amazon stuff it I think actually

105
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,240
Amazon as opposed to having them do it themselves

106
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,776
Tell me the smarter move because

107
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
I feel like both Hasbro Mattel it had some

108
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
Issues were they

109
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
I didn't think all this technology

110
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
So

111
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,784
And I kind of like the idea of adding

112
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
Some of these

113
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
Gaming Elliman

114
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
It's to the ecobee

115
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
Because it is kind of a fun thing

116
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
To do with your kids

117
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
Like my daughter and I play

118
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
Would you rather

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
And we also play Jeopardy

120
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,583
So some of these things

121
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Especially

122
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
Especially like trivia games I think

123
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Would be fine

124
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
In this isn't Amazon

125
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,519
First for a coveted toys

126
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
Last September

127
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
The echo button

128
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,895
Which is like a $20 pair of button

129
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
You hit the button

130
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
And you're like

131
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,295
It's like a button in trivia so you

132
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
You get to go next

133
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,903
Right right they work with certain

134
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
Skills Witcher

135
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
Game oriented

136
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,559
That's a little more interactivity that less voice but still smart so yeah

137
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
I get it there aren't too many of those

138
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:59,007
What's 16 of those right now

139
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
I thought that already

140
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,175
The other thing is they talk about most of these being things like

141
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
It will play a soundtrack

142
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,271
I'm sorry it is so lame

143
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,343
I'm not I'm not excited about that but I would like to

144
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
Be able to interact

145
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Morphwiz

146
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Amazon

147
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
I do think if you wanted to do that though

148
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,303
You would actually want to build like a Persona 4 Madam a

149
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Laker game persona

150
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
So

151
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,423
When you were playing with her

152
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,471
That would be great by daughters only child

153
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,007
She'd have more of a

154
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
It's more fun as opposed to like

155
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
The score

156
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,175
Right right

157
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,967
I thought it was interesting that the

158
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,807
Travel trivia game The Voice Originals When in Rome which is

159
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
This morning's choice

160
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:50,975
It uses voice actors for some of the questions and some effects and such and I think that's great that's a speaker

161
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
But then

162
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
You know

163
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,119
Maturbation keep track of the scores and provide guidance on rules but

164
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:03,519
That's a part of the fun of the game just and it's Dino just adding scores up and I'm not having fights with angry sandwich see that score

165
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
As opposed to just saying

166
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,871
You know you're winning 7 by 7 points

167
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,943
There's no questions asked at that you know there's no math involved

168
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
I guess I was thinking like when you be fun to have a monopoly arbitrator because like I don't know about you

169
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,671
When I play Monopoly with some of my friends it's like all out War

170
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,975
Different rules

171
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,767
House rules in Monopoly

172
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,327
So you can you can definitely see like

173
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,143
An opportunity there but then I got to take up

174
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,239
And then I'm like I don't explain to Madame about like

175
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
My family is like oh

176
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,383
You can you can give people instead of paying the back you can give them like

177
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,943
Returns when they land on your property

178
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
Wichita

179
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
I think my husband and I almost divorced over

180
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:52,671
Chase book this may not appeal to all our listeners but I would say the best use of a smart speaker pair with a game

181
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,975
What do you have the smart speaker whoever it is

182
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,303
Dungeon master in Dungeons & Dragons

183
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Okay speaking

184
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,167
Dangerous

185
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
I could have been somebody either I could have just said

186
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
Speaking of matter bag but I

187
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Play next weekend

188
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,991
Traveling it's crazy it makes me the information is reporting that

189
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
You should not take money

190
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
From

191
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
Amazon's Madame a fund

192
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
And the reason

193
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,647
Is because

194
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
They will screw you over

195
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,535
That's me too long didn't read version of this

196
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815
They pulled a couple examples

197
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:36,191
Really the point of the story isn't don't take money from Amazon it's just that all the big

198
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
Platforms

199
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,263
Really trying to win

200
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
It's a consumer Smart Home

201
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
Consumer Hardware

202
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Which means

203
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,895
They don't have time for your

204
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
Efforts to build an app

205
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,223
They're going to turn you into a modified hard

206
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
Fast as I can

207
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
So

208
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,599
Example what are the examples was Amazon

209
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,159
Had made an offer to buy August

210
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
Locks

211
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
Apparently end

212
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
August

213
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
Said

214
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
No

215
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,815
We don't want that and

216
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,887
Then they were like well okay fine will work with yuan

217
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Amazon

218
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,983
Deprogram but it turned out that Amazon kind of wanted to take

219
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
The software experience away from August

220
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,127
August was like no I want to send people to my ass

221
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
Because that's what's valuable

222
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
Me neither

223
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
Usernames I neither

224
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
Data other email

225
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
That makes sense

226
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,647
Yeah it does and this is the danger in this race in general

227
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,951
Just before the show you drop a good example of

228
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
What's the Apple home app

229
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,839
That's the unified experience for a smart home and now I'm kit world

230
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,423
But all the individual apps they're still there and still install if you want them

231
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,239
But the thing is once people go to an easier CMAs

232
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
Experience of

233
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:48,127
Then these companies that sell the products and create the software for it

234
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
Who's out of the sufferer experience

235
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,039
Once actually Jason Johnson over in August to the Sea over dog is

236
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
I'm about

237
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
This sort of like

238
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
Commodification

239
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,975
And he was like you know the poor always going to send people to rap to

240
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
Things like you have to download the app

241
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
Install it to calibrate your

242
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,679
But that's that's not making that customers life

243
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,519
Isaiah Wright

244
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
This didn't feel great

245
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
This makes sense

246
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
The lesson to learn from this is

247
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
My God

248
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,455
If you don't have some unique and compelling a pin

249
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
I'm with you

250
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,319
A lot of the value of these things is to do not ever have to use the app

251
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,647
I mean I can't tell you how little I use my phone to control my

252
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Back to devices

253
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,743
And that's great for maybe Amazon

254
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
Google

255
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,071
Music now but it's not great for

256
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,607
Hello sir tune

257
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Any others

258
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,191
Yeah. I don't use my Wink app

259
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,519
Very much at all even though I have install my watch my phone's Etc

260
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
It's all voice

261
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
Tell me that

262
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
Absolutely

263
00:09:54,431 --> 00:10:00,575
Gel and then the other samples when we were familiar with your other show which is Amazon had invested in nucleus which

264
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
Which was making an inner

265
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
Cam system using battle

266
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
And then they put out the

267
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,511
We had Jonathan Frankel on the show talking about how this

268
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:16,447
What yeah they can see why I can say it was not just intercom systems video conference type intercom system with a screen a display just

269
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,983
Like the Echo Show now has so

270
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
I don't blame him for being upset

271
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
Indeed RI

272
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
This is not this is

273
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
An ongoing

274
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,247
Do you want to be valuable I think you have to Center yourself around Gathering

275
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
Useful data from you

276
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Your device

277
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
And you don't companies that do that really well

278
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
Please like Kenzo

279
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
Connected thermometer

280
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
Basically

281
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Creating

282
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Epidemiological

283
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
So close you guys

284
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,655
Unblock where diseases are spreading

285
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
And that kind of stuff is

286
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,007
Really compelling in the other side where I think you could get

287
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
Value is

288
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Something like

289
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
I hesitate to even say that you love and be

290
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,687
It's really expensive in G he's going to come in and try to do very similar things

291
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
But that's something that provides

292
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
Value without

293
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
The app

294
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,343
But it's just so unique in the market you're like yeah okay

295
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
This makes sense

296
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:13,535
This is why everybody wants to get out of hardware and this is why we're not excited about the Netgear Arlo IPO

297
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
Why were concerned about Ring

298
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
Raising money at a

299
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,399
Billion dollar valuation

300
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Just us

301
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
Realistic by the way

302
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,263
As you just heard ring is a sponsor of the show

303
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
In

304
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
Obviously does not change your opinion on anything

305
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
All right

306
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,431
That's the hard life for Hardware

307
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Let's talk about something

308
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
Cool and Future

309
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
AC

310
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
There's an event this week called the international salad

311
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
State circuit

312
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,671
Comforts which is like the nerdiest place in the world

313
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
It is awesome

314
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
For people who likes

315
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,327
Imparted what team out of this was a bunch of cool new sensors

316
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,191
So when you guys probably heard about was Sony did a low-power CMAs

317
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
Ucmas just means

318
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,591
Manufacture a low-power image sensor that does motion detection on the scent

319
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
So basically

320
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
It's like

321
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
Something's moving it doesn't it just needs that sensor

322
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
And you don't need to have like

323
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,039
Crazy battery or crazy bandwidth

324
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
In Texas caviar

325
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,391
This is interesting cuz it does take

326
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,999
The need for two sensors and turn them into one you don't need a motion sensor to set as well as a camera

327
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
This has like a stack

328
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,327
Structure where one piece of it

329
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,423
Can do the detection and it doesn't through each individual pixel on the top sensor

330
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,727
When the pixels detect movement

331
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,591
I kind of think this some of this technology sorter used in phones today with pixel focusing features

332
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,199
It's just a way to make this cheaper and smaller

333
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,991
Inside of device

334
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,063
Exactly that's all you need to like change the game

335
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Cheaper

336
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
Smaller lower power

337
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
This does the motion detection

338
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,743
At only one point one

339
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
Ashton Kutcher

340
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
Crazy

341
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,119
Qualcomm has there they have

342
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
It's an image sensor that does

343
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,983
Do like 3 to 5 machine learning models

344
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
Just the execution of them

345
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
But it can do those

346
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
Sub to milliwatts

347
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
Not this year last year

348
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
End

349
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
Talk about it okay

350
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,855
So Microsoft also showed off

351
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,391
New time of flight

352
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Sensor

353
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,719
This is actually a type of sensor used in the lighthouse

354
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,511
Camera that we've talked about a little bit

355
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
Basically it just gets death

356
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,119
So instead of just seeing a flat picture the computer season

357
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
What something is based on

358
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
And gets a sense of death

359
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
This is

360
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
Useful for all kinds of

361
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
And

362
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
Microsoft

363
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
Basically making it

364
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,151
More accurate

365
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
Conception because once again

366
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
That's the name of the game here

367
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
So let's see what else

368
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,391
What else do we see there's a couple things I linked to anytime storage

369
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,695
Talk about this including 200

370
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Meter race

371
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
Imaging

372
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
Get to Bloomberg

373
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
Which wrote this week

374
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,143
Story about how everyone will have

375
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
A smart home

376
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,983
Is this story actually disappointed me a little bit because

377
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
Is very much focused on the gadget

378
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
In

379
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
I don't know about you Kevin but

380
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,407
I have so many smart gadgets but I still have a very dumb hole

381
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,199
So I don't really

382
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
Appreciate that

383
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:17,599
Every ship like the idea that guess we're all good except these gadgets to make our lives easier and better but I don't

384
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:25,279
I totally agree I said this for a while now I've had a lot of smart home devices in my house but that the data is not used

385
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
Contextually and together

386
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,607
Home itself has not yet smart

387
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,887
And so

388
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,495
I think we're getting there and I think we're seeing the Growing Pains of that obviously with

389
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
These stories like

390
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,823
Don't let Amazon invest in your startup

391
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,919
Bloomberg appreciate you highlighting a lot of relief

392
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,247
They're on the same page as us with basic

393
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
What things have to be

394
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
Provide additional

395
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,343
Function they can't just be

396
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
For no reason

397
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Or for just room

398
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
Okay let's

399
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
Do the news Rundown

400
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Last week

401
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
Google bus idly and Kevin

402
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Has something to say

403
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,703
I had something to write actually I put a blog post up late last week after

404
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,239
For thinking about the whole

405
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
Intent to purchase

406
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Google isn't

407
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
How to purchase thyroid

408
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,895
You know we talked Stacy you and I talked about the

409
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,711
Google's iot strategy marketing message

410
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,759
Platform save tools a few weeks back

411
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
And said

412
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
Its competitors

413
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Talamore

414
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,367
Helen cohesive end-to-end story

415
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
So the purchases Island

416
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,071
Actually will help Google because I really has a very compelling end-to-end story to talk about why you should connect your products

417
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:36,959
Why and how you should connect your product how do you create business value save a whole business process Services team

418
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
To help people go from prototype

419
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
Two incomplete projects

420
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
And I don't see that at Google so

421
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
Google's going to get that Google's going to get

422
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Zaxby's

423
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:52,831
Existing customer base of which Lutron is I did not know that fact I took Lutron Just 4 months of working as I wait to get there

424
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Products connected

425
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
Which is

426
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:59,743
Super impressive if you ask me how long does it take Google to do that I can't even name a company that's done that with Google yet

427
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
I don't know

428
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,095
I believe there's 45 employees from zyber that will also become

429
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,935
Google says well so I was getting a lot of smarts a lot of

430
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
Experienced a lot of business

431
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,287
This process management when it comes to iot

432
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,359
And I think it's a great idea for them to do this a lot of

433
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,455
People wear poo poo in his whole deal with a lot of an adolescent like you understand

434
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
The whole story here so that that was my thought

435
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:28,415
And does Ivory and I have no idea how many people are still there and how much of the original platform is

436
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,743
But when seikaly started out it started out

437
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
Basically in mm

438
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
8

439
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,375
So way before it was very forward-looking

440
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
In the biggest thing you probably would have

441
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,983
Recognized it was called patchbay

442
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,567
And it did radiation monitoring in Japan

443
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
And after the

444
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,663
Big earthquake in the nuclear disaster

445
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:56,063
Fukushima is at Fukushima that sounds right now they actually had a crowdsourced

446
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Radiation

447
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Pittsfield

448
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
Very Google

449
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
Fairy Lake

450
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
We are Tech

451
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,535
Where is we want to try to change the world we're going to build

452
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,119
Some crazy platform and just have people crowdsourced stuff on it

453
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
It just

454
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,703
That's his Heritage so what

455
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,495
Feels like not only do they have a

456
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,311
Telling story but it came from a very Google

457
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,383
That sounds it's a good fit

458
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
Okay other news

459
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
This elicited 204

460
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Kevin so

461
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Kevin

462
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:32,415
Yeah that was really really impressed by this is another Google thing and has to do with machine learning where I'm sorry artificial

463
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Intelligence

464
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
Google Verity

465
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
Which is their health

466
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,071
Osteria they are able to

467
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
Take retina scans from eyes

468
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,447
And determine with 70% of the time

469
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,727
Accuracy

470
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,823
If you're going to have a cardiovascular event heart disease issue

471
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,895
And the way they do this is they scanned

472
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Old

473
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Retinas

474
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,991
Look for patterns that isn't there AI

475
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
And then check

476
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,319
The results of the AI predictions against

477
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
People

478
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,927
Five years later or within five years did have health issues that's how they taught it

479
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,487
And that's actually amazing because

480
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,279
To do that today

481
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,351
The method requires a blood test and so on

482
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
It only is

483
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
Accurate 72% of the time

484
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,287
So with a i and retinal scanning is almost as accurate as blood test

485
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
That's it

486
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
That is and

487
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,663
It ties into two things one is

488
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
When people are talking about health

489
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
Data

490
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
I think it's really important

491
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
We talked about

492
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Like electronic records

493
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,879
I think I could become increasingly important for

494
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
Training

495
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
Do you have to have

496
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Both

497
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,535
Potato that you're looking at but you also have to know that diagnose

498
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
Gnosis or what have

499
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
Listen to the patient

500
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
It says you're going to need them or

501
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
Picture to get these

502
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,215
That's why we see a lot of x-ray

503
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
Kind of AI efforts

504
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
Because that's like

505
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Yes

506
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,663
Or that person is having a stroke but some of these other things

507
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
School requirements

508
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
Longitudinal

509
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,015
A patient over a p

510
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
Right

511
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,391
Just related I actually just yesterday joined the Stanford heart

512
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,695
Study program through my Apple watch

513
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,487
So I'm confirming my own

514
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,303
Heart rate data to that program which is the one where they can

515
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
Predict if you're going to have health issues or heart issues

516
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
All right

517
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
Maybe one day we'll see her

518
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
I'm gay

519
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
This is for me

520
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
Why is Cam

521
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,871
So they're launching a second wyze cam I got an email last week saying hey

522
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,943
You got your first wife campuses the $20 camera that we

523
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:35,551
And apparently a bunch of you guys were really into it cuz a lot of

524
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
I don't know if y'all bought one

525
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
I really enjoyed mine

526
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
Superfine

527
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
And

528
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,767
It's like disposable because it twenty bucks it does a lot of good stuff

529
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
Second one's coming

530
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,911
And they're getting an ifta integration integration

531
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,215
Coming up which is what they said they would do

532
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:01,151
Yeah if you have a show for example you be able to say Madam a show my wyzecam excetera new

533
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
Stream at 4.

534
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
It is and

535
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,015
I'm not sure what day is it

536
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Functionality will provide

537
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
So that's what

538
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,439
You don't know what this new one has motion tagging a better sensor

539
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,767
Still the same price

540
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
It's crazy

541
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,863
These guys

542
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,191
For Amazon people their whole model is to

543
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
To sell something

544
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,775
Barest minimum margins they can it's just sell

545
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
We'll see how that works out for

546
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
Hey we are commodities

547
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
Accepted

548
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,943
Duvin design your product for that reality

549
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,247
All right and do you need

550
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
Madam

551
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039
In your car

552
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
I don't

553
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,927
I would just talk to my phone or carplay or Android auto

554
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,279
Your car is still that maybe don't have Bluetooth or USB ports and whatnot so

555
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,911
The Wirecutter said hey if you need madhumeh in your car there's a number of plug-ins at you

556
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
You could get

557
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,751
Like 60 bucks or so

558
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,799
They ran through all of them

559
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,871
I think the general take on this was he here they are

560
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,967
They're okay they really need it I don't know

561
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,503
Do they link to

562
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,575
I would imagine they'd have to

563
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
Did you have a subscription or

564
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,184
Yeah I know it's you it's is probably it would choose

565
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,768
To the phones again I guess you should just use Google Assistant

566
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,072
You can use your phone

567
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:28,448
If you have a matinee happening and she's always listening on your phone sometimes do have that built in now so

568
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,544
I don't see the need for an atom but again I have a newer car that has

569
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,104
No carplay and Android auto my choice so

570
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
I can just speak to the car

571
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
As opposed to plugging in a little

572
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,992
Gadget taking up another spot

573
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
If you do have some gadgets

574
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,600
I think you're testing a camera system

575
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
I am

576
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
Will have more

577
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
Reminder Kevin

578
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
Homework

579
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
Also cars

580
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,864
Alphabet song

581
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,936
Getting a little closer to having a self-driving

582
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,240
How long will it be till we're riding around

583
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:08,128
I don't think it's going to be too much longer we knew that waymo was testing there

584
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
Sweet of

585
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,456
Self-driving cars in the Phoenix area

586
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,528
And what they've done now is they have gotten

587
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
Approval

588
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,368
To operate as a TNC in Arizona

589
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,928
Which TNC is a transportation Network company

590
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,744
That allows them to legally charge for rides

591
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,304
So at this point from a legislative standpoint it

592
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,704
It's kind of like they got their ducks in a row there because Arizona is one of the more liberal states when it comes to self driving car testing now.

593
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
Okay

594
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
These guys to Paisley

595
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,568
Take on the Ubers in the lift some song with us

596
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
With WeMo

597
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
Self-driving

598
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
You can charge money

599
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
All right

600
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,224
And now for something totally

601
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,784
I have recently been testing

602
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
Bicycle Domingo

603
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,112
Mirror and this is

604
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
This is America

605
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:58,560
This is a mirror that has a 7-inch display in it and you can

606
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Basically

607
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,144
You basically program widgets and all the widgets are pretty

608
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
HealthWorks

609
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
Weather in

610
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,520
News oriented so it's it's like

611
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
Dashboard interior

612
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,360
And I program

613
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,384
Mine with

614
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,944
Yeah I connected it to my Fitbit

615
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,992
You can also connect to an Apple watch

616
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,528
And the deuce things

617
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,392
Are some unlimited that I found lots of things I have the Virgin Wall Street Journal

618
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,928
I want to see the BBC

619
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000
What's cool about this mirror

620
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
Where is wenzhou

621
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,072
You can set a general settings

622
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
And then you said

623
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
Your own personal

624
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,960
What is it does it takes the information from your

625
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
This is only your iPhone for now

626
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
But your phone

627
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
And it

628
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,408
This is Stacy's phone so I'm going to show her dashboard

629
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,968
Can see Mike my Twitter

630
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,784
And it's nice because it it's personalized

631
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
To an extent

632
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
You have to get within about

633
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
4 feet

634
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,160
You can change the rain gif

635
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,696
If you want to before feet felt

636
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
About right

637
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
So people didn't

638
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
Set it off while they were walking by

639
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,632
And every other time when people walk by

640
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
It just shows you

641
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Like the weather

642
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
Which also is nice

643
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:14,336
It reminds me a lot of it first came out

644
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,384
Text information is personalized

645
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,712
But this obviously Idaho health component because of you said you connected

646
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992
Did your Fitbit so you can get

647
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
Your statistics on

648
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,856
Wigs body mass steps and so on and so forth for the day

649
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,136
I love that it's

650
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,416
A multi-user.

651
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Display

652
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,976
Although for the iPhone

653
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,024
I think I'd only works with iPhone as you said

654
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,864
Nobody my house character phone saying to the bathroom which is typically what I would see this

655
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
Part of this

656
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
So how practical is

657
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
First off

658
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,288
Comes in two sizes there's a regular 24

659
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
$500

660
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
So this is not cheap

661
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
And then there's a

662
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,528
32 High by 24 wide which is what

663
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
600

664
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,624
Initially I stuck it in the bath

665
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
But that's

666
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,928
I was like I never have my phone

667
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,744
So I was just getting the generic

668
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
What's playing

669
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,536
That felt like that

670
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,352
To the hallway

671
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
In there

672
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
People pass by

673
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
That's good

674
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,472
The other Flipside

675
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Is

676
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,520
If you have a child

677
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,824
Again they're not carrying a phone

678
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
They don't exist for this

679
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,152
And you know it

680
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
It in the hallway

681
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
Can see like how many calories I consume

682
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,064
I can't remember if I put that in there they can read my Twitter feed

683
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
So there's trade-offs

684
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,904
And the other the final thing is

685
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,440
Do you really need this

686
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
Yeah probably

687
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,512
What it is fun

688
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,560
Yeah I mean it when you're away from your phone

689
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:45,216
You're in the bathroom your brush your teeth, to her whatever it is do you need that if you needed that you probably bring your phone in with you and stay right

690
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
Read it while you're doing yourself

691
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,568
But it is nice that's why I

692
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
Actually one of my most common bathroom

693
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
What's the weather today

694
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
So

695
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,016
I think it's kind of like whatever user interface works for you

696
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,832
Senior Lifestyle

697
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,880
And it does I asked if they would ever use

698
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,440
Something like the Fitbit cuz I wear that in the bathroom

699
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,488
They're taking my identity

700
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
Turn bluetooth reset that Fitbit has

701
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,120
Security things so they they aren't they may one day do it though for the Apple watch

702
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,400
So Kevin

703
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
You

704
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,704
Get Lucky

705
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,752
I have the darndest time

706
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,032
Keeping the sky up

707
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
Because I am on

708
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
Eero Wi-Fi

709
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,408
It does not that's only 2.4 gigahertz

710
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,456
Band for Wi-Fi and so

711
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,552
It would basically whenever my network was like you should try to fight it

712
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,832
Just drop off the den

713
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
It was intermittent and pain

714
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,952
I know you can't see me but I'm shaking my head back and forth

715
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,280
In frustration because so many of these types of devices are

716
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,816
Single bands and the

717
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,584
Do not

718
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
They were not designed with Mesh networking

719
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
It is very frustrating for you.

720
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,728
Maybe not a whole show but we are tok

721
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
About that later

722
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,800
Because this is something I'm spending a lot of time with

723
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,408
Stay tuned for more on that but now

724
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,944

00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
Is

747
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:43,744
How in my case with multiple Google home devices in Android device

748
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
Don't have an iPhone

749
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,584
Courtesy of work

750
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,632
Not wanting to carry two phones

751
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
Really trying

752
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,704
Transition

753
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,520
2 using iPhone with all these other devices

754
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,800
And it's a struggle

755
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,592
Similar to Stacy's

756
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,640
Switch from Alexa

757
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
2

758
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
Any tips on

759
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
Interacting better

760
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Appreciated

761
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,344
Thanks Kevin

762
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,392
That is an excellent question

763
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:16,512
Better question for our very own Kevin to answer because he actually lives in a house

764
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,792
Acts like what you're describing

765
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:23,680
Exactly exactly how use just for reference I'm generalizing a Google pixelbook

766
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,960
For my main computer

767
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
I have

768
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,056
Google homes in here various sizes and kinds

769
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,360
I have an Android TV

770
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,968
Which is also Chromecast capable and so I answered in the same boat

771
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,296
And it might be challenging during the transition

772
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
Kevin but I don't think it's

773
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,880
Long-term an issue and then here's what I say that

774
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,696
Just about everything I do from a voice standpoint

775
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,304
I'm signed into my Google account so the Google homes work obviously just fine the iPhones not affect

776
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,096
You can install the

777
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,936
Google home app on your iPhone to manage it and so on so that's useful

778
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:02,592
One trick is to install the Google assistant app for iOS on my iPhone

779
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
That will give you a piece lyrics

780
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:08,224
System capabilities with the easiest way that I found to get to that since you can't make that a default

781
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,248
Listening agent

782
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,272
An iPhone

783
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,600
Is to install the widget on your iPhone

784
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
And what that does is

785
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:20,768
Simple slide over from your home screen and you can just tap the microphone button and then say the hot word for Google

786
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,328
And there you go you have access to

787
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,376
Ashlee Simpson everything from an iPhone

788
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:29,472
As far as other information I mean I can Chromecast things from

789
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,568
Generally not a problem some apps.

790
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,616
Still supported the most of them do

791
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,944
So it's really not too bad again ice cream from

792
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
Play iPad to an Android TV with no problem so

793
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:47,648
It might seem frustrating because you can't make Google Assistant the primary listening agent on your phone

794
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,952
But you can always do the widget after install the app

795
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
I'm going to say yes

796
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
Because I do not have an iPhone

797
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,096
What he said

798
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
Kevin Spacey

799
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
That's why he's on the show

800
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,168
All right

801
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
Well

802
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,984
It is that time where we

803
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:07,360

There will be gdpr and there will be

808
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,696

00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
Stay tuned

I'm great thanks Daisy

826
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:24,928
Man I could ask for this

827
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,976
We are going to talk about

828
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,000
Digital ID

829
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,328
It's the new new thing

830
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,864
The new old thing

831
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:39,264
You think I don't know it's been around for a while but it is getting increasingly complicated which is what we are going to talk about

832
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
So

833
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
Quick

834
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,104
Talk to me about your background

835
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,128
Thinking about

836
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
Digital identity

837
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:49,248
Absolutely so you know I've actually been doing digital identity and

838
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,576
Access management forano 15 plus years

839
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
Used to be about

840
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:58,720
Web applications and then we entered the API economy

841
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,792
When it was all about mobile applications and getting them to work

842
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,352
And now in the iot economy

843
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
Which grew out of the API

844
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Economy

845
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,704
It's more important than ever because we have to worry about

846
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
Device identity

847
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,336
And application identities and identities of piles of data

848
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,896
And identities of people all interacting

849
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,432
Each other

850
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
Let's

851
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,480
Talk about

852
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,272
This concept of personas

853
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
Because this is

854
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,088
This is what I run into

855
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,112
The Internet of Things

856
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:30,976
I have devices that I a certain people before the internet of things this was even be

857
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,280
An issue which is I have

858
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
My sense of self

859
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,352
Like IM Stacy and I am always stays

860
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,936
Actually I'm not always Stacy when I'm

861
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,984
At work versus what I'm hanging out with me

862
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
Prince and so

863
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,312
We think about that as personas

864
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:49,152
Talk to me about the different kind of personas that people can have

865
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,968
And then we'll kind of talk about how we should be thinking about dealing

866
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,760
Yeah indeed

867
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:54,784
So

868
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,416
There's some advocates in the world of digital identity and gentlemen vendors for example

869
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:05,536
Google say well you should really have it exactly one identity digital identity that you bring

870
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,328
To every digital service

871
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,864
Every device

872
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
PetSmart

873
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,984
We do live our lives presenting different facets of ourselves

874
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,008
Two different

875
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,312
Circles of people and different services

876
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,360
So you know you have a work-life

877
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,896
I found home life and you might not

878
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,688
Sail the same thing

879
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
Stall those same circles

880
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,296
In fact it was quite revolutionary when Facebook started

881
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:33,696
And try to get everybody to present the same face to everybody in there some researchers that kind of proved there was an article about this

882
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,000
Pointing out that researchers proved

883
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,840
That it's maybe not such a good idea to present the same face to everybody in

884
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,936
Maybe even reuse your Facebook login account your identity

885
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,960
To every other server

886
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,752
This is what we call social sign in

887
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,288
Now where you can reuse

888
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,312
A social

889
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,360
Identity provided by Facebook

890
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,640
Forever

891
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,920
At other services

892
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,456
Although it's quite convenient

893
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
Pattern to reuse

894
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,784
Your social login elsewhere

895
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
Leveraging it

896
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,344
At these other services

897
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:05,696
Means that you're actually sharing is not just sharing a credential as we just defined it

898
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,744
But you're shining quite a lot of data

899
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
That comes with that

900
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,888
With that relying party service

901
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,728
Fraid so yeah but not privacy-preserving so much

902
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,032
So right so it's not just that

903
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,336
Like oh my gosh I want a different

904
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,384
My boss doesn't see me partying on the weekend

905
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
But it's also

906
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:32,064
That maybe I don't want Facebook to have access to like every recipe that I've downloaded using my Facebook identity is

907
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,856
Login for that site or

908
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:38,720
And their real-world consequences I mean I actually know somebody who was

909
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,048
You know considering taking a job with being considered for a job

910
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,096
Add a health-related company

911
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
And when they saw that he like

912
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
Posting recipes

913
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,192
Cocktail which is very good at

914
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,240
They actually we're not so interested in

915
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,800
Which is kind of creepy if you think about it

916
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Yes

917
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
Especially

918
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
Recipes

919
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
It's really means

920
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:02,528
Doesn't prove how much you drink even but if you're over a certain age

921
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,320
Okay

922
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
Maybe he shouldn't work

923
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,136
Actually

924
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:10,208
Shut up

925
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,232
Okay

926
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
So there's fat ass

927
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,072
And now let's take it to

928
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,096
The device level

929
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
Because

930
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,448
What's nice about Facebook is it is my Facebook

931
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,240
But when I start

932
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,288
Dealing with shared devices like

933
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
My car

934
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,896
If I have other people in my household use it or let a friend borrow it

935
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,200
Tickets to devices it gets a little weird

936
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:35,040
So what does that look like now and how should we start

937
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
This is where

938
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,136
We start thinking about

939
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,952
Call identity relationship management

940
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
Talked about

941
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:47,072
That there are no people identities and there are actually

942
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,864
Mobile device identity

943
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,912
You know my phone actually has a unique ID

944
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,704
And they're actually identities

945
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,752
For each of the applications on my phone

946
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
And

947
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,080
Your average car has a lot of identities

948
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,872
The car itself has an identity

949
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,152
Each of the sensors

950
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
In a connected car

951
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
And there's a lot of them

952
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
Has a unique identity

953
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
And

954
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
An owner of a car

955
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
Has one identity

956
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,112
Each of the drivers of a car

957
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:16,256
Cookie money has my identity each of the passengers of the car and when you talk about the scenarios today of

958
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,560
Let's say somebody driving down the highway

959
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,352
And having your average

960
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,656
You know EZ Pass or something like that

961
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:28,032
Which is connected with a payment instrument so that they can you know easily get charged tolls

962
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
Well

963
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,872
Now you've got somebody being surveilled on the highway

964
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,712
Or you have a fleet vehicle and you've got a police officer

965
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,016
Has been assigned a fleet vehicle for their shift

966
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
And you have another voice

967
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
Are coming onto the next shift

968
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,392
Neither real life scenarios pretty much today

969
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:48,512
You want to have the right data being generated about them or the right payments flowing about them

970
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,816
For each time that you have

971
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
Particular driver

972
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
Store owner

973
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
Associated with the car

974
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,192
That period of time

975
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,984
And then a disassociation

976
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
To happen

977
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,032
At the right time again

978
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
So this is why I talked about

979
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
Identity

980
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,616
Relationship management

981
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,408
So that there's a bringing together

982
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
OD identities

983
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,968
Practical purposes

984
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,016
Angular use cases at the right time

985
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,040
I'm going to disassociate

986
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,856
Okay and we just saw the disassociation

987
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,880
When is failing

988
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,696
International Airport in February

989
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,744
Talking about how right now when

990
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
Peopleconnect

991
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,840
Their phones to their rental cars basically all that.

992
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,864
Just stays there

993
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,192
Is no one on your rental car takes it away

994
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
Oh my gosh

995
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,776
So that's just an example of

996
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,056
The lack of disassociation

997
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,336
How should that

998
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,920
Happen where does The Purge from the device and the backend servers

999
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,504
Well one of the ways that I think would be

1000
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,088
Super powerful to do this is actually and I talked about relationships

1001
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,160
Sometimes the best way to think of this is to actually look at

1002
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,208
Technology like graph databases

1003
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,512
And you know that's actually a very

1004
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
Powerful

1005
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,584
And performant way to manage relations

1006
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,376
I'll give an example

1007
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,168
Thinking about smart home devices

1008
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,448
Let's say you got

1009
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:07,616
Now you're smart dishwasher and you kaieteur smart light bulbs and you got a whole bunch of things made by a bunch of different manufacturers

1010
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:11,456
You might have a part of your home that you rent out

1011
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,248
2 something like Airbnb renters

1012
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
And you got family members

1013
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,368
She's got somebody coming to the family cuz they married in something like that

1014
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,904
And what you want to do is

1015
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,928
What we would call

1016
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,720
Constrain delegated Act

1017
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
Access

1018
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,024
To certain parties

1019
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
Like

1020
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,584
Cruising Airbnb renter

1021
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
Today

1022
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,376
And

1023
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400
Kruse family

1024
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,264
So those are relationships that could start to sort of creeped out into the world and

1025
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
Get complicated

1026
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,080
What you want to do is share access

1027
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,872
To those home associated

1028
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
Things

1029
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,688
Only with

1030
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,968
Family members

1031
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:49,088
Only who hasn't been divorced yet maybe and married him

1032
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:53,184
And only with those currently in the Airbnb rental relationship

1033
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
With me

1034
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,768
Those things can expire what you want to do is have them

1035
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:03,168
Actually go along with who's in that fuzzy boundary relationship with you and have them expire naturally

1036
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,240
That sounds lovely but how does that happen

1037
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:12,384
Well it can't happen so you know one of the things that I think you and I talked briefly about the past

1038
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,432
Is a standard called user managed

1039
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,344
Which is based on technology called or which of the standard around authorization of permissioning and consent

1040
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,648
And there's actually a growing

1041
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
Number of standard

1042
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
Around

1043
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,512
Security and consent and privacy

1044
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
And

1045
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
Authorization

1046
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,352
It comes from

1047
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,680
Well the API economy from the old web

1048
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:39,264
World it's actually starting to be more and more applicable

1049
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,544
To the iot world

1050
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,592
That's quite exciting to me because

1051
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,896
It's funny that you know the web world is actually more of a

1052
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,432
Mature in this respect

1053
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
But it's more applicable

1054
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:52,320
Does new world and username to access is actually a standard

1055
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,856
That allows you to

1056
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,904
Delegate constrained access

1057
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,488
Basically any API along lines like this

1058
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,536
So that looks like

1059
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,352
Is that like what I sign into my nest and I'm like

1060
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,424
I'm attaching this device emulator on an app and like

1061
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,728
I no longer own this device I'm going to detach

1062
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,264
Kit to make this a whole account

1063
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:12,800
It is

1064
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,848
Possible to apply to those patterns

1065
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,640
It's now I would love to be in a position

1066
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,712
Listen to talk to Nest about these patterns cuz what we see now is

1067
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,760
You have to implement those patterns

1068
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,808
1byone like sulfur example

1069
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
I downloaded

1070
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
Kevo app

1071
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,184
Because you know might I know some people who have Smart locks on their homes and they

1072
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,768
Invited me to get access to their homes and you know this is how we do it

1073
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,816
So I think you know one by one

1074
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,864
These smart devices

1075
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,680
I've had to implement the pattern of sharing access with others

1076
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,216
A way to do it

1077
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:45,312
In a Multi-Device multi manufacture environment

1078
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,616
Would be to be able to

1079
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:53,248
Add share buttons and add access approval Loops in a more standardized fashion and this would be a way that you

1080
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
How to do it

1081
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,832
Oh so this is like my dream of one app to

1082
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
Control my home

1083
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
And then I can just

1084
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
Deal with it

1085
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,000
It enables you to have a kind of a dashboard of who you've allowed access to what

1086
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:08,608
Okay and we kind of Gliding Over this but I think it's an important thing especially

1087
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Example with

1088
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,936
Your family of divorce in Airbnb

1089
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,472
I don't know what happened

1090
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,264
But

1091
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,544
It's the idea of

1092
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,336
Rights that go along with

1093
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,408
And so it's not just enough to say Hey you have asked

1094
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
Cespedes

1095
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,456
But we also have to make

1096
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,224
Provisions for

1097
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,760
Hey you have access to

1098
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
Despite

1099
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:32,416
I don't actually want you turning my thermostat in the winter up to anything about 70

1100
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,464
Because that's just absurd

1101
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:39,584
Or turning off the entire interface of the Smart Lock so that I can't see

1102
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,144
You know who's coming to my door even if I'm out of town

1103
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
Yes

1104
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,472
So how do we are there Provisions for managing

1105
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
Access

1106
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,032
Right now I feel like

1107
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:48,800
Probably half

1108
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,568
Access my devices

1109
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,592
Do consider

1110
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
And then the other half

1111
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
Durka durka

1112
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,759
Can do it and some of them don't even let anyone else

1113
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
It's only

1114
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,551
One app

1115
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:04,415
Right well it's all as it starts with a matter of what

1116
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,463
Granularity does the API

1117
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,535
You want to start with you know some good granularity there be

1118
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:13,375
Because apis are about making money now and it's sort of

1119
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,423
The host of the API gets

1120
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,751
First right of refusal on what Granite has and you want

1121
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:24,383
Those to be respectful of what the buyer of advice can do but at that point it starts to get really into

1122
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,663
Especially

1123
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,199
I know you've been talking about

1124
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,247
General data protection regulation

1125
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,527
In your podcast

1126
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,551
And in your newsletter

1127
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,831
And this is where it gets

1128
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:37,183
Kind of exciting for people who are in the position to buy devices because

1129
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,719
They're starting to have more rights

1130
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
And

1131
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:45,887
Framework for how they can get more rides and we're granularity is basically coming for those who either are EU citizens

1132
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,703
Indoor travel to the EU and a services

1133
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:52,287
And you know services in front of devices are going to need to start respecting

1134
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,335
Yes if you buy devices from

1135
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,127
People who are based in the EU guys

1136
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,919
This could come to you soon

1137
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:58,943
Yes

1138
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,223
Okay so what does

1139
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:04,063
So I've been mentioning you have access Uma

1140
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,671
And a fact of the folks who work on the samba standard on the cheap Amana Therrien

1141
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,719
We've started to develop a legal framework

1142
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,999
Where you could actually

1143
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,023
Start to have

1144
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:17,119
Kind of standard contracts and even licensing Frameworks

1145
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
4

1146
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,471
How you roll out your terms and conditions and how people can set up

1147
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,495
Policies

1148
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,287
Around what they share with others

1149
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:28,127
And it could even extend to well if you want to make available data

1150
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,663
Coming off the devices

1151
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,223
To Let's a marketing company

1152
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,271
Then that should be possible

1153
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,575
With a kind of privacy preserving bent

1154
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,159
And let's go into one of my favorite favorite topic

1155
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
Switches

1156
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
Kids and I

1157
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
Because

1158
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,511
I have kids

1159
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:49,887
And my child is 11 which means in the US she is governed by

1160
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Copa

1161
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,423
Which state

1162
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:55,007
Child online privacy protection act

1163
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,799
And basically

1164
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,335
Companies can't collect data

1165
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,895
Which right now in my smartphone

1166
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,687
Come means that she's like

1167
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
Yeah

1168
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,295
Difficult doesn't it

1169
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,903
She can't get her voice recognized by things she can't there's a lot she can't do

1170
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,719
Can I get why this is there but let's talk about

1171
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,255
Identities I guess you

1172
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,535
Parent-child

1173
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
Queso

1174
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,095
I feel like I have no identity

1175
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:20,863
It's just

1176
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
Stacy who controls

1177
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
Rosanna's account

1178
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,959
Yasso

1179
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:29,055
Yeah in a lot of the laws in oh this is where I talked about you know this is

1180
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,871
Especially sensitive data and gdpr has a whole set

1181
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,663
Section for it and a really odd thing is

1182
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,943
Under capitalized

1183
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,527
That the age of majority is 13 under gdpr

1184
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,575
It's largely 16 +

1185
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
Four different kinds of data

1186
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:48,767
You find it on every state in the Union you'll find slightly different laws about which kinds of data there's different age

1187
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
Actually even more

1188
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,327
NetSpend

1189
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,631
So imagine that there's different kind of

1190
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,911
Clinical devices

1191
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,447
Is farina generating

1192
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,471
Different kinds of

1193
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,263
Miti Behavioral Health Data

1194
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
Or you know pregnancy

1195
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
Testator for example

1196
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,383
And you know not to scare you

1197
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
Age 11

1198
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,687
Hopefully way too young

1199
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:13,087
But there's no different ages of consent in ages of majority for all these different kinds of data and you know every state and every

1200
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,135
Jurisdiction has a different ages in his nuts

1201
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
So

1202
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,439
Can I see a wrinkle in there

1203
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,255
I'm going to make it even more

1204
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,791
There's also like

1205
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071
F13

1206
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,887
I'll child protection under like Google for exam

1207
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,655
Apple for a while

1208
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,447
What's 0 / 13

1209
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,775
No parent protection

1210
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,567
What you doing

1211
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:39,967
Want necessarily kind of ignores the fact that I want my kid to have access to something

1212
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
Then they can

1213
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
Get further access

1214
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,551
Okay so that's my

1215
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:49,951
You did what kind of a sliding scale if you're to be a responsible parent and yet it

1216
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:53,535
Brightline is for the easiest so maybe some of these things words

1217
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,863
Different age of majority for different things is more reasonable

1218
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,143
Because it kind of admit

1219
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:01,983
Set a responsible parent wants to have a role in their child's life

1220
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,007
For certain things

1221
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
So

1222
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,311
I do only what you want to have

1223
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,079
Is

1224
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,871
An ocean of some

1225
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,151
Management

1226
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
Over

1227
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,711
What a child can do

1228
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
In a

1229
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
Responsible

1230
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:14,783
So

1231
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:20,927
Typically what you would want to do in the view of digital identity Solutions is an ocean of

1232
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,231
Accounts

1233
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:23,999
And this

1234
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,303
Shouldn't be I mean that the solutions that you been

1235
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,839
I think we're just know they're not

1236
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,631
Taking advantage of as possible

1237
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,935
So here is what we typically see

1238
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:32,959
In my world

1239
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,751
It's the notion of

1240
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,311
A full identity account

1241
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:42,431
For a parent or Guardian so you know in law and might be somebody's not a parent but a guardian

1242
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,223
Cancer kind of the proxy

1243
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,247
Freedom child

1244
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,015
And that

1245
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,295
Full account

1246
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,623
Would be able to for example set up the account

1247
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,695
A person could set up the account on their own so let's say it's

1248
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,487
You know Alice that's pickle

1249
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:58,559
In my world is Alice and Bob and Alice wood

1250
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,375
Set up an account on her own should have a process where she

1251
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,911
Proves that she's a beige

1252
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,471
The permissions on the account would be.

1253
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,263
She can do lots and lots of things

1254
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,335
The schema governing the information

1255
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,895
That's stored associated with the account

1256
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,687
Would be very full with lots of

1257
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,967
Information so that

1258
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:20,575
It's not blinding certain things it's not disallowing certain information from being stored

1259
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,855
And then

1260
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,879
You would be able to

1261
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,647
Set up

1262
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,671
Alice would be able to

1263
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,951
On behalf

1264
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:32,351
Of her child little Susie or even younger Johnny knows maybe two years old and can't operate any devices or

1265
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
Or services

1266
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,167
And little Johnny would have

1267
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:35,935
A managed

1268
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,519
And a managed account is very constrained and what it can do

1269
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:43,615
It has a limited schema with a very simple set of data

1270
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:50,015
That would adhere to you know that the applicable laws and the jurisdiction and it had very limited permission

1271
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,551
Effectively be

1272
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,319
Change

1273
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,111
To Mom analysis

1274
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,415
Now what are the things that you can

1275
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,183
Excitingly

1276
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:01,279
You do with the notion of identity relationship management is

1277
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
Reflect

1278
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
The fact that they

1279
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,119
I have a parent or guardian and child

1280
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,143
Relationship

1281
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,447
And if you know Little Johnny's age

1282
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,751
You know when he times in

1283
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,799
To certain ages of majority

1284
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,591
And start to give him full rights

1285
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
Under

1286
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,895
The jurisdiction

1287
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,175
Kinds of data

1288
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,967
You can start to collect more data

1289
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,783
And you can start to be able to build

1290
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,063
Amore Digital Life for

1291
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,135
With the with the notion of a digital twin if you will

1292
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
And then the

1293
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,183
The eventual idea

1294
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
OBD2

1295
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,487
Transfer the account

1296
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,279
I'm kind of like co-signing on a

1297
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,583
Car loan goes on your credit report with

1298
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,375
Your parents with you and then eventually be

1299
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
Becomes part of yours and you

1300
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,423
You go off into the world

1301
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:44,799
Exactly it's sort of like he starts with a thin file in credit language and then he starts

1302
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,127
How to build more of a file as he reaches age of majority

1303
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,663
For certain kinds of data

1304
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,735
And it feels like the Enterprise has

1305
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,015
How to unlock more

1306
00:48:54,527 --> 00:49:00,415
How are we going to see this coming to the consumer World anytime soon cuz it feels like we're years behind him

1307
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Desperately

1308
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,207
Better

1309
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
Options here

1310
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,535
You know I think so I mean this is where

1311
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:10,399
Consumer scale I almost done with a consumer it's just there's a Sturm Scion with stance

1312
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,447
Customer consumer Inc

1313
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,751
Were there we've been there actually for a while

1314
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,031
Has certain properties

1315
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,055
Scale

1316
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,079
And

1317
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Performance

1318
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,383
That requires

1319
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,407
Over and above

1320
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,223
Employee I am world

1321
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,527
And house for a while now so it different is

1322
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,575
In quality and quantity

1323
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:32,927
From what we had to do for the employee or the greater employee population

1324
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,951
For a long time now

1325
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,487
Employees and partners

1326
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
Of the Enterprise

1327
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,327
Because you know a lot of those

1328
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,143
Big companies have or even small companies will have

1329
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,935
1000000 or 10 million

1330
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,215
Or a hundred million

1331
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,263
Customers or end-users

1332
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,055
And when it comes to devices

1333
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,359
That they might use will you know

1334
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,639
Multiply it by

1335
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:56,991
Another 10 factor or a hundred factor or if you start looking for sensors

1336
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,783
And I'll keep multiplying

1337
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,111
I don't have to be in a relationship again just keep multiplying

1338
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,391
Bright but I wanted

1339
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,671
Call my relationship

1340
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,463
Things in this case not have

1341
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,535
Company and that's there's no real framework right now

1342
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:10,815
Does that

1343
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,863
I mean we are seeing

1344
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,631
That

1345
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,935
Not only the standards that I was mentioning

1346
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,471
Do account for that

1347
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,495
But I mean

1348
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:21,823
This framework is very real for what I see everyday

1349
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
What we do everyday

1350
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,639
And this is where

1351
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,687
Particularly that graph database

1352
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
Slayer

1353
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Does

1354
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:28,991
Managed

1355
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,015
Tackle

1356
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,111
Performance needs of you know what an individual person has to

1357
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:38,975
Deal with any one individual person I mean how many if you imagine that you're sitting policies

1358
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,255
For who I want to share with

1359
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,815
You know Our Brands tend to explode if we

1360
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,607
We have to jump higher than

1361
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,167
527 anything's at one time

1362
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:53,567
So I think that that that notion is probably pretty well accounted for but the Frameworks of the kind of Technology

1363
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,847
They were talking about I think

1364
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
I think it exists

1365
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,663
It's stuff that can be done

1366
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,943
So then the question is

1367
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,223
You need a business model

1368
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,527
This because yeah

1369
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
So

1370
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,623
I think about my digital identity who would I trust

1371
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
A

1372
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,671
To have all of

1373
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,743
In feet what I pay for it

1374
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,071
And how am I going to pay for it out of pocket cuz right now I pay for it like

1375
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,631
You know a lot of people trust apple and they have a lot of

1376
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,911
Digital identity associate

1377
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,447
And they pay for it

1378
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
Face painting

1379
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
Exorbitant

1380
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,263
Devices

1381
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:29,151
So you see like a breakthrough possibly happening there especially as we have so many more things

1382
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:34,527
So you're asking a question you know how many digital identities should we

1383
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:35,807
And

1384
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,647
It's so tough being so I use a password manager so I can certify

1385
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:42,719
Count how many logins I have and it's not pretty

1386
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
Who have hundred

1387
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:47,839
And you know the average person to do any studies an average person has in Odessa

1388
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
A dozen

1389
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,887
Or several.

1390
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:56,287
They're lying there totally lying I'm really counting them up and you know I do think more people are using password managers for the

1391
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,823
Still in that going to probably

1392
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,103
Low

1393
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
Doesn't

1394
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,407
Percent something like that

1395
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,943
Did the right answer isn't one

1396
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,735
We're talking about persona

1397
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,039
The right answer isn't one because

1398
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:07,807
Then

1399
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,343
Song

1400
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,903
Identity provider node

1401
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:12,927
Everything about

1402
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:13,951
And there's

1403
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,743
There's a theory now about self

1404
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,767
Sovereign identity

1405
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:21,887
That you're going to somehow hold all the information about you on let's say a mobile app

1406
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:25,727
On your client device and then somehow you'll hold out by Disney information about you

1407
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,519
And you'll be in entire control

1408
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,311
And the reason I don't think

1409
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,591
At the end of the day that's

1410
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,383
Harley viable is that

1411
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
Anybody who needs

1412
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:38,527
No information about YouTube get Services going and have you know offer you into

1413
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,551
Sting services

1414
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,879
They need some of that information Vital Information about you to be

1415
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,415
Asserted by third-party

1416
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,999
Like there's not going to trust you to say well I'm a citizen of

1417
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:48,767
Country

1418
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,047
They're going to rely on

1419
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,863
Next country to say who you we are citizen of

1420
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,679
So it's got almost a lot of things

1421
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:58,751
To come from third-party so those third parties count as

1422
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,775
Multiple sources

1423
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
So

1424
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,615
It's a multifarious problem

1425
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:07,455
So between all of us has multiple sources does that mean we're still stuck with

1426
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,735
That many logins

1427
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,015
Zoe's

1428
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,439
But I think

1429
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,743
Here's where I think that we might

1430
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:25,375
Be able to consolidate I'll give you a little olive branch of hope we may not be able to consolidate source

1431
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,143
Identity

1432
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,703
But I think ultimately someday

1433
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,983
Maybe someday soon

1434
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,519
We can consolidate

1435
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,311
To a short list

1436
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,591
Baby County

1437
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,871
You know one hand

1438
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
Of

1439
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,431
Places where we can manage

1440
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,223
Our preferences for

1441
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,503
Could we share with

1442
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,855
So you know any user managed access Lan we would call that an authorization server you know

1443
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,159
Maybe the dashboard the privacy.

1444
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
Because

1445
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,487
Ultimately

1446
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,023
What preference is we

1447
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,047
What

1448
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,631
Authorization policy we have what privacy settings we have

1449
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,935
Our only source for that should be us

1450
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:03,007
Like if your preference is smoking or non-smoking or

1451
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,543
Aisle vs. window

1452
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:07,615
Can you trust anybody else for that other than yourself

1453
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,919
Like I've trained my husband

1454
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,711
He knows that I get the Isle

1455
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:15,807
Exactly it's I mean you can store it someplace else

1456
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,111
But it has to be self-assertive

1457
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,647
Well this is

1458
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,183
Again

1459
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,463
That's a small Olive

1460
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,231
French meadow cafe

1461
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:23,999
And

1462
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,279
I will also thank you for

1463
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,047
For coming on the show

1464
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,839
It was a delight

1465
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:34,239
Thank you that's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot

1466
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:39,871
Sign up for my newsletter at Stacey on iot cam will see you next week
