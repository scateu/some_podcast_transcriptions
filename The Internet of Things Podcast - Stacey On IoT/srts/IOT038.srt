Kevin tofel

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
And Kevin I was apparently

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,504
Play feeling Grinchy this year but

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,296
For the holidays

8
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,856
We know that you're probably going to get

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,392
Apple connected devices

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
If you're listening to this show

11
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
We hope you get

12
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,024
We do we hope you get them unless you don't want any and then you know

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,816
We're glad you're listening to the show anyway

14
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352
And since

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,912
Since this is going live on Christmas Eve

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,984
We wanted to do a special holiday podcast

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,080
In which we briefly spend a few moments with you to sing a few carols

18
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,872
Drink a little eggnog

19
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
I'm just kidding

20
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,944
Freaking out he's like there was no singing

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
I was reaching for my glass

22
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,016
You had me right now

23
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,392
No we wanted to do just a quick kind of like

24
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,672
This is our Christmas gift

25
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
Do you guys which is

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,352
Which is actually kind of a downer we're going to assume that you might have some trouble say

27
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,912
Merry Christmas

28
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
Yes so

29
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
In case

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
We're also going to assume that

31
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,592
We're going to try to help you out

32
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
Before you get into

33
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
So

34
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,968
We wanted to share advice when we're setting up connected.

35
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
Send devices what do we we've gone through all the pain point for years so that you don't have to that's our hope with us

36
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,160
So here we go

37
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,696
Starting out

38
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
Kevin you want to go with

39
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
With your your first

40
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792
Tip for people

41
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:44,192
Right off the bat you've got to have patience and time put aside if you're going to be connecting your devices weather

42
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,592
Are there add-ons to existing system or just a whole brand new system I'm in I was joking with Stacy before the show this is now

43
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
Not the kind of project

44
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,200
That you didn't want to do it between say Christmas dinner and dessert

45
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,248
Make sure you give yourself plenty of time

46
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
And have patience

47
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
Is devices upon startup sometimes there they look like they're ready for you to add things you don't maybe you got a hubber bridge

48
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,000
Legend cycling headlights

49
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,304
Just make sure you wait sometimes babe

50
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,376
LED indicator sometimes it don't just be patient

51
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,680
And follow instructions when you should be fine

52
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
All right on that note

53
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
You need to read the

54
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,080
Instructions and you need to have your tools at the ready

55
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
So

56
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,224
So guilty of this I am often like so excited I grabbed it out of the box

57
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
A start

58
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:34,368
Trying to install stuff and then I've got like my hands full of stuff this is really important for like

59
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
Things that involve

60
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
Light switches

61
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
Locks

62
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,488
Actual physical installs of products

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,048
But make sure you have your tools ready

64
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
Like that include your phone

65
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,168
If for some reason is still like back in the early

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,984
Translate mm and has only a web app

67
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
I might need your computer

68
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,312
So read the instructions

69
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,104
Make sure you have your tools ready

70
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
I'm screwdrivers

71
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
If you need to

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
Turn off the power of my God turn off the power

73
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
And then

74
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
You know

75
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
Start your install

76
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
Don't be too afraid to do any of those things

77
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
Exactly exactly

78
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,768
And then once you really get going

79
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,352
The first thing I do with just about any device that I add to my house

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,448
I always check and see where in the app for where the settings

81
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
Firmware version is appearing

82
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,312
And usually will see a check for updates in there

83
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:29,664
Always check for updates before you even start adding devices to other devices

84
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:35,040
It's a simple process you might follow instructions to the T out-of-the-box for device

85
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,064
But it still doesn't work

86
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
What's usually the culprit

87
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,672
From where maybe something is changed and instructions

88
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
Haven't weeks or so on and they don't apply anymore because the firmware has been changed so I highly recommend making sure and every single device

89
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Has firmware

90
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,168
Make sure you update that from her before you really get going

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
Also with this

92
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
Possibility

93
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
Make sure

94
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,056
Your device actually works with

95
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
Your device

96
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
So

97
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,968
I can't tell you how often I've been like in the Google app store or Play Store

98
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
Xiaomi

99
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,344
I'm looking for an app for device only to find out that it will only works with iPhones

100
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
And I'm like

101
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,488
That's not a big deal cuz I also have an iPhone but if you don't you're going to be kind of sad

102
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,607
And actually that probably should go before the other one because a bunch of open the box York

103
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
Going to be like now I can't return it

104
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
This is going to be the worst regift ever

105
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,383
Just to add to compatibility a lot of these products write on the box

106
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,711
I'll tell you what hubs and bridges and other products they work with

107
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,039
So just make sure before you even open it

108
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
Just make sure that

109
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,415
You know if I say will work with the base B if it says it's compatible on the box

110
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
You could open a keep going

111
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
Yeah cuz what if it's like

112
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
I'm sorry Mom

113
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:53,375
But what if they're like Clarity like connected devices so I got you this connected device

114
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
And then

115
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
Like oh my God but this only works with the

116
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,055
The wink Hub and I have a SmartThings Hub

117
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,127
I need this would not be a problem for me but for other people

118
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
This is true

119
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
So

120
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,015
I know Stacy doesn't want me to say this I'm gonna say it anyway

121
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Oh yeah

122
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,391
This is so under duress you guys

123
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
So are we.

124
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,999
Stacy still upset that I haven't installed the

125
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,535
Bluetooth

126
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
Busy I'm sorry

127
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:29,983
I'm sorry Stacy is still upset that I have not installed the Z-Wave lock set on my front door

128
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,543
Actually I have tested it

129
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,127
And that actually is a good thing for this list of things to consider

130
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,711
I already know that the locks that works because

131
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,807
I took it out of the box I put the batteries in I set it up on my

132
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
With my phone

133
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,927
And I was actually using my phone to lock and unlock the door lock

134
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,999
Even though it was in the door and I say this because

135
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Why bother

136
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
Taking out a lockset putting in a new one only if I know it doesn't work maybe you didn't put the batteries in right maybe you didn't set some

137
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,215
Something up right maybe there's a switch inside

138
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:05,567
So just test things before if you can test them before you actually install them

139
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,127
I don't think it's a bad thing I said under

140
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
That's because it's not hard

141
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,247
Install and uninstall lock change the batteries

142
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,415
Also because yes I'm mad at you for not installing the locks I said to you

143
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,487
Anyway moving on

144
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Also

145
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
Kevin brought it this week

146
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
Which is really good point

147
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
About order of operation

148
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
And install

149
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
So once

150
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,983
When she performed are very dull and very serious checklist

151
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,287
Which will save you time and trouble

152
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
Start with

153
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
Especially with things like light bulbs

154
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Start like

155
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
What was your tip there

156
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,015
I said start in the center Mortuary

157
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Yeah
