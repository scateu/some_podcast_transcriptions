What a week

61
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,432
I already tired and we haven't even started

62
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
And it's not just because I'm traveling

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
I'll let everyone know that I'm recording this week from a hotel room

64
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,112
So any weirdness in the sound that is my fault

65
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
And

66
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
You can

67
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,232
Certain send me emails telling me all about how you don't like it

68
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
Or how you do like

69
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
Whichever

70
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
It won't change anything but you can send this

71
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,888
You can tell me how you

72
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
So let's talk about

73
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
Google IO

74
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
Cuz this week

75
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
We had two big Tech

76
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,824
Is Google IO and Microsoft bills

77
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:32,224
Both are really important in our space so we'll start with

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
Google because

79
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,368
So much yes there's so much

80
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,696
Yes I actually watched the live Keynote

81
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,000
Providing commentary on

82
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
Watching it

83
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,400
There was a ton obviously some of it does not apply to this particular show

84
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
But if you're not aware there are new pixel phones that are

85
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,520
Half the price of the current ones and still have all the

86
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,312
Good photo qualities etcetera

87
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
What's a fungi always

88
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,320
For our purposes there are at least three or four

89
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,368
Key aspects I just want to bring up

90
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
Today

91
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,744
And I want to emphasize how privacy and security was

92
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
Underline message

93
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
Google IO for the Keynote

94
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,655
And that's that's obviously important to our listeners

95
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,447
For all their connected devices

96
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
So in that regard

97
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,799
Google demonstrated and discussed

98
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
How they're doing

99
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
Natural language

100
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
Process

101
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,967
This is mainly taking place on the phone

102
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
Today

103
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,295
Google said they basically compressed like

104
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,111
A language down from the learning model rather from

105
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
100 GB

106
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Down to

107
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,743
I have a gig which fits on a phone obviously

108
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,791
And what that does is it

109
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,399
Brinks privacy when you're speaking to devices that have on device NLP

110
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Presume this will be coming to the

111
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,519
Approximately in the near future but it's for phones right now

112
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
Protect your privacy because the

113
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,175
Things you say don't go to the cloud it's all happening on device because

114
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,967
Already there

115
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
So that is important

116
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,319
Additionally Google is talking about their next

117
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
Generation

118
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Assistant

119
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
Of course

120
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
In the home

121
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,463
People that Google Home Products that's very relevant

122
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,047
Discussion again was around on device processing

123
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
Also what they're doing with the assistant

124
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,679
Last year they had duplex were they

125
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,263
Yeah you can speak

126
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Reservations

127
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
Which you can do that now

128
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
I took about a year

129
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
Blowout etcetera but it's here

130
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
In actually

131
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
Just a quick

132
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
I didn't realize this duplex like full duplex

133
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,087
Conversations basically mean a conversation where

134
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,647
Highest person can say something and then

135
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
Another person responds so it's a

136
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Actual Back info

137
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,279
So I had no idea that's where the name Duke

138
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,375
Oh yeah I mean I thought about it from like modem

139
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
Yes I don't know why I didn't make that connection

140
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
That's okay

141
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
Back to the 80s

142
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Anyway

143
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
So they're bringing duplex to the web

144
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,919
And they showed off how you can book a car

145
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
Next trip for example you're on a trip

146
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,807
Google on a trip because you probably have email saying that right

147
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,159
Yes Google knows where I'm staying at night how I'm getting there when I'm getting there

148
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Yes

149
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,487
So what you could do in the demo anyway

150
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,047
Sho Nuff you could say hey G

151
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
Book a car with national for my next trip

152
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:33,727
Instead of going through all the steps in on the way International app

153
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
The assistant

154
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,639
Refills in all the information based on where you are when you're going to need a car

155
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,991
What car you might have enjoyed using last time etcetera because has that

156
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
So it can

157
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,623
Free fill everything in and can say okay I've got your car books

158
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,415
Do you want to pick up class

159
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
Chose this class last time

160
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,255
And literally make a reservation happen

161
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
4 Yuan

162
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,143
That's really cool to be even cooler if I can save book the cheapest car and it can go find

163
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,447
I would not surprise me if

164
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
I always want more Kevin

165
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
Also they should work on switch

166
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
However

167
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
Because again Google has this information

168
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:23,391
Later this summer you're going to see on Smart displays a new feature called pics

169
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
For you not

170
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
Pictures for you but pics

171
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,791
Such as suggestions of recipes events and podcasts

172
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,863
Which is fantastic because podcast Discovery is a

173
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Huge cow

174
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
Yes why aren't more people listening to

175
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,007
I didn't go there but yes

176
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
All over the place

177
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,103
All right

178
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
We got gesture control

179
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:50,783
Gesture controls in the home and I wrote a post about this not that long ago

180
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,087
Isn't all that when it comes to the home

181
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:57,183
There are times you want to do things without waking somebody up or shouting to speaker

182
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
An amazing new

183
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Google

184
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Nest

185
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,095
Hubmax will talk about short languages

186
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
Their next smart display

187
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,191
It has a camera and that camera has

188
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
Face match

189
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,031
Meaning if you allow it to

190
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,079
Recognize faces you have to train it

191
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:20,735
When people sit in your house they will save their calendar information pop-up which is rather interesting

192
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,039
From a Jester standpoint when it's

193
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Laying

194
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,135
Music or something like that maybe your phone rings you want to stop

195
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
You don't have to shout out hey

196
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,535
Instead you can just wave your hand or put a talk to the hand gesture out there

197
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
It will stop playing

198
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,607
Now I kind of wanted to do that automatically

199
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
With yonomi

200
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
Once I discovered my devices

201
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,055
Actually automatically whenever my phone would ring

202
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
It would stop on my Sonos

203
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
It was kind of cool but it did kind of

204
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
I had to take my daughter Sonos out

205
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
She got really mad when my phone

206
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
In her music interview

207
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Greenwood stop

208
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
However

209
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
Pennisi privacy implication again

210
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,255
What Google is doing is it is switching

211
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
The learning models for language

212
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,399
And switching to the edge so what happens now or will happen

213
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:15,519
The learning model happened on your phone or your Google assistant device

214
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
And only the

215
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,591
Model itself

216
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,175
Will go back up to the cloud to make everyone's model better

217
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:26,527
So your date is going to stay local you won't be sending it to the cloud goes we sending

218
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
Model information

219
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,391
Excellent and going back to your own device natural language

220
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
This is something I wrote about unless

221
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,231
Swix newsletter I talked about

222
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,791
With something like this and a microphone

223
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,375
People could actually build voice control devices that aren't connected to

224
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,471
The cloud exactly now this will only work for Less sophisticated

225
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,775
Things like you're obviously not going to go

226
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
Here we go full duplex

227
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,615
With some of it isn't cloud-connected but

228
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,431
There are lots of things where you could actually

229
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Have

230
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
Functioning NLP model Plus

231
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Sense of

232
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
Commands available to the device

233
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,111
It would make a lot of sense.

234
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
So a washing machine

235
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
One of my favorites

236
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Because

237
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,535
Little complicated you're like I've got a bunch of sweaters or jeans

238
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
If you could just tell it

239
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
I'm washing a load of jeans

240
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
It could actually pick the settings

241
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
For you

242
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
Yeah without the cloud

243
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,079
That seems like a really good use cases

244
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
Reducing

245
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
The intellectual load

246
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
For the person

247
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
And also enabling a computer

248
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
Voice control to make it

249
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Easy to do something

250
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:36,671
Kind of help can I get the sense from Google IO that that's where they're heading with all of this which is wonderful because

251
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,999
Today everything has to be connected for a Google home

252
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
If you don't have

253
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
Internet connection

254
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
Google home as useless as our other products

255
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
Eczema products such as mathematics

256
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
You have to wonder though

257
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,007
Google's big revenue is it sad business

258
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
So where does an inn we don't need to answer this today

259
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
I don't think we're going to but

260
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
My overarching question

261
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,199
Google is going to be

262
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,247
I know that they're using data to build

263
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Better products

264
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
Siddharth said

265
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
At some point in

266
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,391
Time if you're not advertising

267
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
Sing what are you do

268
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:14,303
And it makes sense everywhere and you don't have screens everywhere you do have to flip

269
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
So just keep that in my

270
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
Home Products are going to get better in one way

271
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
And yet they're going to get worse in another

272
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
So Google has killed

273
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
It's works with Nest program

274
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
Or rather it is killing it

275
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,271
After June 25th you'll be asked to migrate your

276
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
Nest accounts

277
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
It sounds like your Google Wi-Fi

278
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
Google

279
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Home

280
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,023
Yes because it's kind of vicious

281
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
There's a lot of

282
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,071
Duplicity there

283
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
Duplicity that's lying

284
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:55,263
There's a lot of vacations there has been a long week

285
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
3200k

286
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
So you're basically

287
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
In some ways this makes sense

288
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
So what's happening

289
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
Is there killing their works with me

290
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
You will be asked to migrate Your Nest account

291
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
Your Google Wi-Fi account all of this into one

292
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Google home

293
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
Google assist

294
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:19,583
And the reason they're doing this is because they're changing the way the nest device

295
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
Historically

296
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,703
Developers have been able to use apis to call for info

297
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
Information from Nest devices so like

298
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,823
I might have my hue light bulbs talk to Nest to say

299
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,615
Is Stacey home or away right now

300
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,431
And if I go away it will actually change my lighting

301
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,575
Because I'm away and it's nice that makes my house look more lived-in and secure even if I'm on vacation

302
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
So

303
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
That is going to change

304
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,207
No longer will devices be able to grab

305
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Data

306
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
From Nest device

307
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
So if you are another Smart Home

308
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Company

309
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
Or a service such as if

310
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
Etc

311
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,983
You will now have to go through Google home

312
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
To talk to Nest device

313
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
And you won't

314
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Be able to get

315
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Data from

316
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
So instead of

317
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,431
I look at it like

318
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
In the older

319
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,319
System all of my Nest devices in my Google devices they work together through

320
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Formal integration that I did

321
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
My Nest devices

322
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
Other devices through formal integration

323
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,255
And basically every device had a brain

324
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
And many of them

325
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,167
What's going to happen is all of my Nest devices are basically losing their brain

326
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
Inability to

327
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
They're only going to talk to

328
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
And the implications of this are

329
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,383
If you have Nest devices those Integrations will break

330
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
As of the end of

331
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
August

332
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
And that means if you got

333
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
Thermostats at

334
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
Store

335
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
Are any of that all of that goes away

336
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Some of them

337
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
Will be reinstated

338
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
But not all of them

339
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
Google actually

340
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Had been

341
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
Very

342
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Considered

343
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,815
About how it used its API so

344
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,887
It actually limited the API calls on Nest devices

345
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
Is it wouldn't actually give you video

346
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
Turn Nest devices to other

347
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
Video capable screams unless they were Google

348
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
So

349
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
Some of this week and moving toward

350
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
But there's a bunch of applications

351
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
Consumers

352
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
So let's talk about

353
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
What is

354
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
Every smart home now

355
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,647
Needs a hug that's the model we have clearly moved

356
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,975
So in Google's world it wants it to be the Google home

357
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
In Amazon's World it wants

358
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
To be madame

359
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
The funny thing is we

360
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,935
This is kind of reverse ending for the past I'd say year I've kind of been

361
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
Giving up on hubs

362
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
NSYNC

363
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
I want a hug

364
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
But I guess

365
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
Market dozen

366
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
Now the market soccer

367
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Right

368
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,783
So this begs the question hey what happens to

369
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,647
Companies that have acted as like virtual hubs or physical Hub so like a SmartThings

370
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Wink

371
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
You know me

372
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
Etcetera

373
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
I look at

374
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
Dislike

375
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
SmartThings will probably

376
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
Now go

377
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
Talk to Nest devices through the goo

378
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
I see that

379
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,007
It'll be an interesting test for WIC

380
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,311
To see how really on top of things they are

381
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Because

382
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,383
This is going to be a development of

383
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
There's going to be a pool here that you have to make

384
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,735
And I don't know if link is going to do it

385
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
And then

386
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,343
With a company like you know me which is all virtual

387
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
Don't know how this is

388
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,439
I am very eager to talk to them

389
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
Send out some emails

390
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
End with ant if

391
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,303
It says that it will not hurt it at all

392
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,839
Rishi Chandra

393
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
Who is

394
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
Ahead of Hardware over at

395
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Google

396
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
He actually spoke to a colleague of ours yonko

397
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
Add variety

398
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
And he basically said

399
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
This kills

400
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Didn't basically

401
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
You said it will break

402
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
It

403
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
So that's

404
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,735
Not great news for EFT

405
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:54,623
When people who really rely on if they mean there's going to be a lot of upset people with they haven't heard this news already

406
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Yes

407
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
So

408
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
You're like oh my gosh

409
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
I love my smartphone

410
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
What should I do

411
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,607
Well the scorched-earth protective gear

412
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
Google to the curb

413
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,191
But this is going to be happening

414
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,751
Everywhere because what's happening is

415
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,079
Your Hardware devices are providing valuable data

416
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:18,175
They're also providing that dated other places and it's become too hard for a cup

417
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
Company to control

418
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
So long with fist

419
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
Announcement Google is actually put out

420
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
Really good

421
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
Guidelines for

422
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
What sensors are in it

423
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
Devices

424
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
Hello sensors are used

425
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
And

426
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,511
How the data from the

427
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Centers are you

428
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,119
That's not something it could do if it was actually sending this out 2/3

429
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Parties

430
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,935
So in some ways this taking back up

431
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,727
Control benefits you as a

432
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
As a user

433
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
Better perspective

434
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
Understanding

435
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Who has your data in

436
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Now

437
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
As a consumer

438
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Sort of hate

439
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
I get why it's at

440
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,551
I do hate the fact that now all my Nest devices are

441
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
That they're no longer like

442
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,647
I don't know if they're going to work in Google's going to do it

443
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Man

444
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
Integration right Nest at 1

445
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
Will Google

446
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
No idea

447
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
So

448
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
That

449
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
Could be a problem

450
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
The other thing is

451
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
There are plenty of smart thermostat

452
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,471
Out there in the world there are plenty of sick

453
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
Security systems out there

454
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
It may be that

455
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,103
If you go all in on Google

456
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
You get to seamless

457
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
Apple like experience right

458
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,711
And a lot of people like

459
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
And they don't mind being that limited

460
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
So they will keep that

461
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
Imagine a lot of our listeners will

462
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,159
Probably steer closer to

463
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
Another device

464
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
Maybe it's the ecobee thermostat

465
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
That is really awesome

466
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
Maybe they do something with Honeywell

467
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,631
2 works with both Google and madam

468
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
End

469
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Siri

470
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,471
So they're still options if

471
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
If you want to have fun

472
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
Multi-Device

473
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
Household

474
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
You're going to have to

475
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,895
To go independent and you're going to have to work a little harder

476
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:59,551
That's the downside of meanness make things more difficult in the decision-making and setup process

477
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,135
Planning process it's going back to a side load model

478
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
Wish app

479
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,719
Has pretty much a solid model

480
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,047
Now looks like Google's going that way in yet

481
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
They don't

482
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
Truly have like a multi radio

483
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,703
And one thing it was not announced was that next gen

484
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,239
Google WiFi product

485
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,079
All-in-one with a Mesh networking and potentially

486
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
As a hub that I've been talked about

487
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Before

488
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,943
Mr. All That device is still in the works

489
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,759
So is there a Google home

490
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
True upcoming I don't know

491
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Yeah me either

492
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
So

493
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:41,279
That's pretty much all we have time for but we'll we'll probably keep talking about this as more information comes out and where vendors are

494
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:46,143
And in a lot of it you're going to see in your home a lot of emails over the next few days telling you

495
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,215
This particular device is going to change his functionality

496
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,007
We didn't even get into like the idea of

497
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,823
How device functionality changes but will do that later

498
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,175
Okay before we get away from Google I O I just want to

499
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,479
7/32 invention that Google

500
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,527
Nest hubmax which is a new product

501
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,575
It's a 10 inch smart display very

502
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
It's identical to the smaller

503
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,671
What used to be called Google home hub

504
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
It's now called the

505
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Nest hub

506
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,815
This has one more prone to tweeters for Better Sound it's got a camera

507
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,375
What you can turn off electronically not with a shutter

508
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
And

509
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
That camera can be used

510
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,007
Like a nest cam to monitor

511
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
The room around it

512
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,359
Got a security feature as well

513
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
The original

514
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
Google home hub

515
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Yes

516
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,247
I should probably dig into the Google privacy

517
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
Palisades

518
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Okay

519
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
Look for my newsletter it's going to be

520
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Full of exciting

521
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
All right moving along

522
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,255
Not very far just to the next digital assistant over Madam a

523
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
Amazon's digital assistant

524
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
Do we calm anime because

525
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
Cuz we don't want to set everyone

526
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:55,007
Jeff Eller over at the Washington Post did a wonderful deep dive on his Madam a

527
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,823
Differences these are the things you say or every time that

528
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
Madam

529
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Wakes up

530
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
And says yes

531
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,783
It starts recording so he went and listened to all of his recordings over the years of living with

532
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,855
And what he found is

533
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
A lot of

534
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,415
Totally normal

535
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
Interactions where he's like

536
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Turn on the lights

537
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Play the song

538
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Set a timer

539
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:21,887
Videos about a lot of times where it was mistakenly activated and lots of fragments of conversations that

540
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,679
Should have never been recorded

541
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
Much less

542
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
Tencent up to the cloud for bras

543
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
So

544
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,847
People read this and he said he is actually dumping his

545
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,639
Amazon Echo and his Google.

546
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,431
He's like yeah I'm done

547
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
Not doing it

548
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
I know this is how she

549
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,111
And I went through and I actually on my Google device change the way

550
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,183
It works because you can go in on your Google devices

551
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
Pause the

552
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Recordings

553
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:51,071
So it won't actually record your utterances when

554
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
You say something

555
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
Like a g

556
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Now

557
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,167
That means it won't go

558
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,215
Get better so that is the trade-off your make

559
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Getting there

560
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
However I was like yeah I'll make that

561
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
Straight up at school

562
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
There's not an option

563
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
Palazzo

564
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,151
I don't know what do you think Kevin I'm like should I

565
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
Don't matter to me

566
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
And I know this is happening

567
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:13,343
It's a very personal choice on it so I can't make a blanket statement telling people what to do

568
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,440
I think you have the right approach you have a good understanding of

569
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,512
What it says what it sends to the cloud

570
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,840
And you're making that choice you know between convenience and privacy

571
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,704
Don't use a madhumeh my house is outfitted with Google products

572
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
Cause

573
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,080
I just prefer those products in the way they work it has nothing to do with the privacy

574
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
So

575
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,504
I don't know I mean this is not something I mean I don't think anybody should be terribly surprised by this

576
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,320
4 years putting a microphone and or cameras in your house

577
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,856
Ways to privacy

578
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
Challenges and

579
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
Oh yeah

580
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:52,512
If that's the kind of environment you want to live in where you have the convenience

581
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,560
Of the features that these bring them

582
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,120
You're going to have to live with those privacy application

583
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,448
Right and as part of that or maybe it was

584
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Was totally into

585
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,776
Over a taxi ozena freed who is

586
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
Excellent

587
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,664
Said or did an article on what Amazon knows about you

588
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,968
And it's pretty astonishing

589
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
I mean

590
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,040
It's not astonishing

591
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
You know if you

592
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,136
Oh yeah Amazon

593
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
Video

594
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,048
Or what how many books are read on my Kindle including for me my library books because I get

595
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
A lot of library books

596
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,144
Hand with key

597
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
Amazon go in nose

598
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,984
And it was

599
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,312
It was a pretty good overview some of the link to that so you can have

600
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,104
More educated decision

601
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,408
I didn't really talk about Amazon's credit cards

602
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
Chase Bank

603
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,504
I have one of those along with many other people in

604
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
Look at those quite a bit about that too

605
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,392
Nina also has Links at the bottom of that

606
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,976
With similar articles about what Google knows about you Facebook

607
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,792
Tesla Etc and they are also well worth the read

608
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
Alright here's some

609
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
Little Amazon product

610
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
Amazon has

611
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,776
Dependents man of a ring integration with person detection alerts

612
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
About time

613
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,968
Yeah so this is a new feature you can find in the settings for your ring camera just

614
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
Disabled person

615
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
Detection

616
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,344
And I assume it works similar to like the nest hello person detect

617
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,232
She better notification that tells you who's at your door or in the middle

618
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,048
I don't even have to open

619
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
I just need to know Kevin

620
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,656
Amazon is also a blink XT

621
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,704
T2 camera

622
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Is a battery powered

623
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,288
Camera Amazon bought blink

624
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
2 years ago

625
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
Link head

626
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:46,944
Been a chip company that had a really cool image processing chip that

627
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
Was very low power

628
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
And

629
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,624
That didn't sell very well or didn't sell it high enough margins for them so they decided they were going to make a camera

630
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
And I sold the camera

631
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,720
And it's worked really well and Amazon bought it so they got a

632
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,024
A camera company but they also got a really cool

633
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
Silicon provider

634
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
As part of that

635
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,864
Background of Link

636
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
The blink

637
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,680
Xt2

638
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,496
Is an indoor outdoor battery-powered 1080

639
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,056
PhD video camera

640
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,592
Two-way audio

641
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,176
It's going to be 90 bucks with free cloud storage and no monthly fees

642
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
I will say

643
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,504
We got a lot of requests for a

644
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,272
Wireless

645
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
Outdoor cam

646
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
This

647
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,160
It does amazed at the battery life they claim

648
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,696
Two double a batteries

649
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,512
Would last up to 2 years of battery life

650
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:36,096
That is the medical power of optimized silicon

651
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
Yep

652
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,192
So I'm going to get one of these cuz

653
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Why not

654
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,520
Wireless outdoor camera in $90

655
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,824
Is that why is kimchi

656
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,616
No but it's not crazy

657
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Much less

658
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
Soho k

659
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,736
Moving on to the next big Tech

660
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,272
Compass Microsoft

661
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Also happening this

662
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,880
And a lot of stuff on the industrial sites

663
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,952
Things We Should Know Windows 10 iot

664
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,024
They actually are making it a lot

665
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Easier

666
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
To get your old

667
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,144
I don't include industrial but you're old

668
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:14,240
Stuff that's running older versions of Windows like Windows CE

669
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,032
Over to Windows iot

670
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
Windows 10

671
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,128
So that migration was really important

672
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
Because there's tons of old stuff out there

673
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,504
It is susceptible to all kinds of security flaws

674
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
We just need to tell

675
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,624
But you can't kill something that you spent $1000000 on it runs like some highly

676
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
Proprietary process

677
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
But now you can migrate it

678
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Yay

679
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,256
Microsoft also announced

680
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,072
Rather it's AI in robotics

681
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
Cool kid

682
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
Any limited preview for Windows

683
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:47,520
So you can

684
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
And as your tools

685
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,104
Physical systems

686
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,384
Yay

687
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,736
Now basically this is the really embedded part of

688
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
The internet

689
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
Things in Microsoft

690
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,880
There's ways to get them running a modern secure operating system

691
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
That will conveniently

692
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
Tie back into a cloud

693
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
All right

694
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,280
Also at build twilio

695
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,584
Announced that they will have

696
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,144
Some of their iot SIM cards

697
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,240
Will Ty and very easily to Microsoft azure iot

698
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:23,360
SKB part of Microsoft iot plug-and-play connectivity effort in

699
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,384
Microsoft

700
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:31,040
Way way way back in the day when you actually connected your printer and keyboards and stuff to your computer they had a plug and play poker

701
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,344
So you didn't have to download driver

702
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,928
Microsoft Word with all these device manufacturers that they were like

703
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464
Where can I build everything we need

704
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,792
So someone can just come in and plug in a printer to this machine

705
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:47,168
That's basically what they're doing with iot plug and play but they're working with manufacturers

706
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,216
Devices into the Azure cloud

707
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
So

708
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
Similar

709
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
Concept

710
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
Slightly different index

711
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,128
And so these are smart Sims

712
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,480
Run by twilio I think this is going to be a big deal for people who want to

713
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,760
Plugin brand

714
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Two devices

715
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,624
So large scale

716
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
And deploy large

717
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
Yes

718
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,256
The other two things that are worth noting is

719
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,072
Microsoft also launched better conversational skills

720
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
Cortana

721
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,632
And again while

722
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,936
Google and Amazon are very focused

723
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
Smart home Microsoft

724
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
Very focused

725
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
Enterprise

726
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,056
It's doing a lot of the same thing

727
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,848
NLP on device

728
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,432
Thinking about privacy and basically trying to figure out how to deploy

729
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,248
Conversational based agents throughout offices

730
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,832
If you think about this this is a really great area for my

731
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,392
Microsoft understands that

732
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
Hey

733
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
You can't

734
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
Who does advances because it might be someone's like

735
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,280
Secure earnings

736
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,816
Who are other data

737
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,632
So Enterprises are very concerned about this

738
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
Sorts of things

739
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:54,752
So looking for Microsoft to do a lot of cool stuff there

740
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,776
We're seeing a

741
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,800
A couple of last year

742
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
I was at build and I saw a really

743
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
Awesome demo

744
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:03,712
We're basically this device in the middle of a table

745
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
R MTG

746
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,504
Tok notes

747
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
Flag action items

748
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
Concentra portal

749
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Everyone who is a

750
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
The meeting this is the kind of

751
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,392
Technology that

752
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
Fairy Tail

753
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
So

754
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,256
Yay looking forward to that

755
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,816
And then there's one that everyone was talking about

756
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,840
On Twitter

757
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,912
Was a demonstration of recommendation engine

758
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
Interpolated drive-thrus

759
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
Starbucks

760
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
It was very cool

761
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,800
I'm not going to go into that because you know Microsoft just bought a compass

762
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,080
Neither does the same thing

763
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
I fully expect recommendations

764
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
Everywhere I am

765
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
Anyting

766
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
But

767
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,504
What's cool about the Starbucks demo

768
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
1

769
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,600
They're putting iot and all sorts of Starbucks gear

770
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,160
For the predictive maintenance and making sure everything's

771
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
Running

772
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Well in the

773
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
Physical stores

774
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,768
But also they're using

775
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,816
Azure sphere to do it

776
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,120
Azure sphere Grew From

777
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
Microsoft Project sober

778
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
A couple years ago

779
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,240
This is Microsoft sway

780
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,520
Keurig iot

781
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,568
It involves a secured ship

782
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,152
That talks to the cloud and gets data from the cloud

783
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
Certified as being

784
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,968
What it's supposed to be

785
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,552
And all of the information passing between the devices

786
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
McLeod isn't

787
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
And

788
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
It's in the cloud

789
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,440
Checking for vulnerabilities as they

790
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,464
Come up and then

791
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Letting

792
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,536
Updating the chip and letting the

793
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
Manufacturer

794
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,864
So this is kind of like an ongoing

795
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
Physical 2

796
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,168
To Cloud

797
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Security solution

798
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,544
Microsoft just talked about for a while but I haven't actually seen anyone using

799
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
But now I have

800
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,152
And that's good because for a while

801
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,480
When they announced it a lot of people are very skeptical they're like

802
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
Yeah I don't think this is really

803
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
I know it is

804
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
Okay

805
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,624
Few other stories to get to

806
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
Bluetooth

807
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,952
The Bluetooth Sig

808
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,488
Special interest group

809
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,560
Has released a report will link to it in the show notes

810
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,864
Basically it's telling us that

811
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,144
There is a lot of blue

812
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,448
For example

813
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,984
There are now

814
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,800
34465

815
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
Bluetooth Sig members

816
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
That is a

817
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,152
70%

818
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,176
Birth rate in Alaska

819
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
5 years

820
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
Witches

821
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,576
In 2018 there now 3.7

822
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,648
Billion Bluetooth devices shipped

823
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,952
A dumper they expect to grow

824
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,488
25.4 billion

825
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
By 22

826
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,816
That's per year

827
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,376
Well that's not cumulative that's amazing

828
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
Yeah

829
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,288
Okay so there's a lot of really good information in here like

830
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,616
Hey of those shipments how many are for audio streaming

831
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
Versus

832
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,176
Just straight up

833
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,736
Sensors and health and wellness in others

834
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,784
So we'll dig into that a little bit more

835
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,320
The newsletter

836
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,624
You can read the report

837
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
From the links in the show notes

838
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,768
Okay in the update to a story we talked about last week we talked about

839
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,072
Tenants in a New York apartment building

840
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,400
Suing their landlord who wanted to put latch

841
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,424
Deadlox

842
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
The building

843
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,496
In that case is now settled

844
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
So

845
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
The results of the settlement

846
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
NR that

847
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Tenants

848
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,152
Get physical keys

849
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,456
If they want that they argued that their privacy issues

850
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,480
Play etcetera

851
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,272
The downside is this is a settlement

852
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,808
This isn't any sort of legal

853
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
Decision solution

854
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
President being set here really

855
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,416
Except for other

856
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
Kudzu in

857
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
Point of this settlement

858
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
I guess

859
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
But

860
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,072
This is bad news for latch

861
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:36,448
Or maybe it's bad news for landlords who want to cheap out and buy only electronic systems

862
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,496
Without physical keys because latch actually does

863
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,032
Offer a physical keys

864
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,592
And so in the settlement

865
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
The judge said that

866
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,688
Hey physical keys are a required service for landlords

867
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,736
So a smart entry system

868
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
It's not considered

869
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:54,112
A required service so at the landlord doesn't provide physical keys

870
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,160
The tenants could bring this to court

871
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
Again so

872
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,720
Keep that in mind you guys if you

873
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,280
You're getting a smart lock system in your apartment building and

874
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
You don't

875
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:02,816
Want to give up

876
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,584
Physical key

877
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:09,216
Yeah it's not just a privacy the people concern within one particular person in the

878
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,264
And the case is 93 years old

879
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:16,128
Says he's not capable of using a phone anytime self trapped in his home because the Smart Lock

880
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,200
Yep that's the sort of thing people love to read about

881
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
All right

882
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Adele

883
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
It is time

884
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368

DACA

893
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,568
/ iot

894
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,896
We're not going to be playing a voicemail because we got

895
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,712
Several voicemails asking us about the wise

896
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,736
Since

897
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
System

898
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,040
And this is a kit

899
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,344
Sensors made by

900
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
But the wise camera

901
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,160
And I've been testing this in my

902
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,464
Actually for the last few weeks

903
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,768
And it's time for me to tell you what I say

904
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
First step

905
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,584
The wise since

906
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Package

907
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,144
Is $20

908
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,936
You for that price get a bridge

909
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
You get

910
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,312
Open close sensors and one motion sensor

911
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,592
All of these

912
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,128
Work with a wise

913
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,200
The bridge plugs into the back of the wise

914
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
Cameras

915
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,784
So basically what you're looking at is for

916
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,320
4250 bucks

917
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,624
You get this like me

918
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
Security system

919
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,952
It is not monitored

920
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,792
So keep that in mind but it is a really convenient way

921
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
To set up

922
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,656
You should call it security maybe we should just call it information

923
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,472
I mean it's nice nice to know

924
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,800
When people are coming and going in my house so I set this up

925
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
In about 15 minutes

926
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,360
Plugged in

927
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:55,200
The camera I put the bridge and I said everything up but got a comprehensive

928
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
Review on this site

929
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,528
The bridge goes into the actual camera

930
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,600
It does so Kevin eat this is a bridge you would not mind

931
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,184
Exactly cuz it's not another box sitting somewhere on a table

932
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,720
And I put in my camera at the

933
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
Front door

934
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,256
My apartment

935
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,792
And I stuck the

936
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:15,424
Open close sensor on there and every time I set it up so every time that door opens it record the snippet of video

937
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
And

938
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
It works

939
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,776
I don't know how to say actually since I'm traveling

940
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,848
I've used it to check on my dog who spends all day by the front door waiting

941
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
I decided

942
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,480
I'm not going to lie it's really sad to watch

943
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,504
And I said

944
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,112
Another sensor I set it up on the back door and then I set up a motion sensor

945
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,648
At the back window

946
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Because we got

947
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:39,232
Paint it it looks over the balcony that we have

948
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,512
Pick up painters on the balcony

949
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
A psychologist

950
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
Wanted to

951
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
I'll keep an eye on them

952
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:49,216
For that setup though I would need another camera where I guess I would do the pancam to go pay on where the motion was

953
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,264
I don't know if it actually does that

954
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
Cuz I don't have a pan

955
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Nuts

956
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
Okay

957
00:34:55,616 --> 00:35:00,736
It works I don't know how else to say it. Latency is incredibly low these are sensors that only work with wise there on a

958
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,552
Totally proprietary sub gigahertz frequency

959
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
They're small

960
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,416
I cannot emphasize to you guys house small

961
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,440
The sensors are

962
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,488
Bear less than an inch

963
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,512
It is

964
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Crazy to me

965
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,864
Haven't worked with these like to install motion sensors

966
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,240
Also crazy is the price what you're getting for your 20s

967
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,520
Oh yeah

968
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:28,384
Granted you have to have a $20 wyzecam so case was for 40 bucks to really use it

969
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
But still

970
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
I get a camera

971
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,968
Motion sensor

972
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,272
To open close sensors

973
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,904
And have that kind of functionality for literally 40 bucks you have nothing to wise products now

974
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,256
That is crazy cheap cuz I just one motion sensor can easily cost you

975
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,792
20 bucks if not more

976
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,816
Oh yeah and

977
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,352
This is quality Care

978
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,168
I obviously have not been testing it for a year longer

979
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
So I can't tell you how the battery life

980
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,984
Going to work

981
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
I can tell you

982
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
It comes

983
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,616
The tape already on the back so you don't have

984
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,640
Mess with that

985
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,664
Having tested

986
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
Dozens

987
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,736
These sorts of devices over the last few

988
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,528
Sears this is easily

989
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,808
Up there in build

990
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
Lovely

991
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,160
The other thing that people who are privacy-focused my

992
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,232
Want to know about his wife lets you record everything to an SD card

993
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,000
On the camera

994
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,560
And yes

995
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:23,936
But you don't have to have the SD card if you do the event-based recording it will go to the cloud

996
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,960
So you need to know that

997
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
And

998
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,824
They use encryption on the device they have two-factor authentication which we love

999
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,848
Because

1000
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640
Two factors the way to go

1001
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
End

1002
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Yeah

1003
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,040
I did this just to play with it

1004
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,112
It's also a great gift graduation is coming up here

1005
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,672
Your kids are going to be moving the college are moving to

1006
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
Apartments

1007
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,768
Something like this is a really nice way to get them

1008
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,584
Okay

1009
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
So

1010
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,400
The show has been crazy long

1011
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,704
Going longer still

1012
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
Please

1013
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,264
Stay tuned for our guest

1014
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,128
Kiva all good who is the brand new head of iot and Automotive at Erickson

1015
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
We're going to be talking about

1016
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
IG

1017
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
We're also going to be talking about

1018
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,808
Why the industrial internet-of-things has not

1019
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,088
Got me adoption

1020
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
It deserves

1021
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
And a lot more

1022
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,672
So stay tuned for her

1023
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,720
And for a message from our sponsor

1024
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,280
This week sponsor is Dell Technologies

1025
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:29,728
Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is

1026
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,568
Dell Technologies and we are here with bask Iyer who is

1027
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:39,456
And general manager for Edge and iot at Dell Technologies

1028
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,784
Bascule bikini next week at iot world

1029
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
And one of the big

1030
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,624
Is how organizations

1031
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
Can learn to be digital organization

1032
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,208
Do you have any insights

1033
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,744
To offer our audience on that

1034
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:52,768
Yeah

1035
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:57,376
Digital is not just technology it's about people process and Technology

1036
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,704
And we found that in all this is the time to hire good talent

1037
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,544
People who actually understand digital who actually understand real time

1038
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,872
You know your business excetera you cannot just Outsource this

1039
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,200
And we going to talk about process we going to steal a few things from

1040
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:17,600
The world of software development and introduced the concept of the edge I'm not just for software development but the whole company

1041
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
And then obviously technology as a big play

1042
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,488
So it's not just technology but equal

1043
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:29,888
So we talked about people across the same technology and culture the culture is a culture of innovation culture of doing

1044
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,216
Something trying out and if it fails come back very quickly

1045
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,544
Concert is going to be very important in this world of moving to digital as well

1046
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,360
And I understand you're going to be bringing a case study

1047
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
Along with you

1048
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,664
Can you tell me more about that

1049
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:46,272
Sure this is going to be exciting we going to bring an actual case study we going to

1050
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:52,672
Showcase the city of Las Vegas how they're trying to improve the efficiency and safety and drive Innovation obviously

1051
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,488
BM Arendelle Technologies and her partner

1052
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
ATT

1053
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:00,608
And how we create an ecosystem of large-scale iot and its solution

1054
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,656
So Cal Technologies

1055
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:07,008
Is working with a lot of companies in building ecosystems

1056
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,848
So where does Dell Technologies and VMware play in that

1057
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,384
When should folks call you

1058
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,968
We actually believe that we want to encourage is ecosystem

1059
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:20,320
You know we don't believe one player can dominate or should dominate this whole Space

1060
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,880
Iot and Edge is very big it's going to benefit

1061
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,184
All of human society worldwide

1062
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,488
Strongly believe that didn't

1063
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,304
Believer ecosystem

1064
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,864
Please show that before BMX well-known

1065
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:38,752
To promote multiple ecosystems multiple partners multiple storage vendors multiple Drive cloud

1066
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:42,592
We call ourselves the multi-cloud multi-application Multi-Device company

1067
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:48,992
So that's why the ecosystem is important and quite honestly the people we're going to be working in iot and Edge are people

1068
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,208
People such as Honeywell Siemens MSI such as NDT Emerson

1069
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,536
Tillotson and Allen Bradley and so on and so on and so on

1070
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:05,888
Ecosystem for all it players all OT players

1071
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,728
And all system integrators so we can provide what is Right Seneca

1072
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,544
Excellent so where can we go

1073
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,592
To learn more about Dell technology

1074
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:20,992
Well you could come to the Dell Technologies, iot and we'll have a lot of information

1075
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:33,280
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

1076
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,120
Is Kiva Allgood who is the head of iot and Automotive

1077
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,680
Akita how are you

1078
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,472
I'm great sweetie how are you

1079
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Excellent

1080
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,544
It's all right so you recently

1081
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,944
Joint efforts now so let's talk about

1082
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,480
How you look at the iot

1083
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,808
Yes all things iot and Automotive

1084
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,648
So you know anything that's not a handset I'm super excited to be part of the air

1085
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,256
Family and team and from my point of view iot is a slightly over

1086
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,328
Word internet of things or industrial internet

1087
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,608
The reality is it

1088
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,144
The platform of the future

1089
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,912
The way I look

1090
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:15,008
So all the transformation that we've seen over the last 10 years

1091
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,080
Connecting People via phone so you no longer attached

1092
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,664
To the wall you can go anywhere globally and that really means everything

1093
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,688
He says you think about

1094
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:25,248
Transitioning from a analog world

1095
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,320
To a digital world that's happening in your car

1096
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
What's happening in Europe

1097
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,624
Appliances

1098
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
Happening

1099
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
Industrial

1100
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,440
Dance floor

1101
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
That's happening

1102
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,560
Turn thermostat elevators you think about anything we start to touch

1103
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,120
It is being transformed by connectivity

1104
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
And so

1105
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
From my point of view

1106
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,008
It's a it's a perfect place to be because they're going to be driving the

1107
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,288
Forefront of that change

1108
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,943
I agree with you actually I am very much that iot is a platform of light Broadband was kind of like the mobile

1109
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:01,343
The internet was having everything be connected and having data streams from all of them is going to enable entirely new ecosystem

1110
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
Systems services

1111
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
Is it going to be

1112
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
But

1113
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,951
We're not there yet so

1114
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,231
Let's talk about

1115
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:13,631
You worked at Qualcomm which is on the chip side doing building that actual infrastructure u42 GE which is very applied

1116
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,447
And now you're on the kind of networking site at Erickson so

1117
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,239
Given that you have this

1118
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,311
Wide-ranging view of what we need to make iot

1119
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
T possible

1120
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,127
Let's run through some of the big challenges

1121
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:27,199
A lot of people talk about there being like a billion connected to

1122
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,271
Devices switch feels like a lot but even if we want to get to you know

1123
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,295
100 million

1124
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,671
We're still dealing with some basic challenges of scale

1125
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,695
Which ones

1126
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,463
Are you thinking

1127
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,815
In order for that Internet of Things

1128
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
Become truly that

1129
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
Format p

1130
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,911
Can design develop

1131
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,191
Tree ecosystem

1132
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:52,287
Become the next millionaire off of we are going to need to strive for

1133
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,823
Interoperability

1134
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,615
And interoperability will drive

1135
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
Scalability which

1136
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,223
Without the combination of those two things

1137
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,247
It's really difficult

1138
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
Get to that prophet

1139
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,087
I also think one of the key things that

1140
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,367
Is bullying thing

1141
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
Holding

1142
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,695
Say it isn't technology

1143
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,719
It's human behavior

1144
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:15,071
So if you think about where we're starting to connect things it's on a plant floor

1145
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,607
The factory already exists

1146
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,655
There's in billions of dollars spent

1147
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
How to build backpack

1148
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,215
Now we're going to retrofit and

1149
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,543
Connected wirelessly with 5G cuz you can

1150
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
The latency and the

1151
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,127
Performance is the same as if it was wired

1152
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,735
Plus you get a whole bunch of other productivity cuz you could rework the the factory floor

1153
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
In a day

1154
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,063
But a plant manager is going to be resistant

1155
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Because they're so used

1156
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,719
Kind of the way things are and the way the factories laid out today to tell them

1157
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:45,023
They could reconfigure their floor in a day

1158
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
They would be

1159
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
No way because they're the ones

1160
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
Responsible for the outfit

1161
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
Plus there's a lot of

1162
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,959
Systems and things designed in Ms

1163
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,007
Example that industrial example

1164
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
That would have to also be flat

1165
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:01,407
You have to keep your OSHA ratings you have to have documentation how things work

1166
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,431
How to keep your eyesight

1167
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,455
Certification

1168
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,735
Sport in the

1169
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:09,855
Wireless space we were just replacing a phone on the wall and putting it in your pocket and then it became a soup

1170
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,135
Computer

1171
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,415
Standards bodies like

1172
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:16,255
3gpp and others that were working collectively together

1173
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,839
Bring those things to Market we have to start to see that in the internet

1174
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,655
There's a lot of work being done and gone 3gp

1175
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:29,055
AEP and other standards bodies but now they have to find their way into other forms and other places that people work

1176
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:35,455
So that's like the National Association for water utilities Naruto or the electrical certification contortion

1177
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,247
Since he's got all of these standards

1178
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,807
And standards bodies that also have to be in school

1179
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,855
Understand the value

1180
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:45,183
That wireless connectivity can bring in the iot can bring

1181
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:48,255
And I was this year at Hanover I'll tell your personal story

1182
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,047
The 5G was at the Forefront

1183
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,327
Insecure you've got this

1184
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
Historic event

1185
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,167
That's I've had the pleasure of being

1186
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,447
An attendee at

1187
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,983
Over probably the last six

1188
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,567
Yours and connectivity with a component of it but it wasn't at

1189
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,615
Forefront of the show and this year it really was

1190
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:09,503
Searching for starting we're at the tip of that transition where the people's behavior and recognizing that

1191
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,831
You can do it differently is going to start to change people's behavior

1192
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:13,855
Start to change

1193
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,439
Kisses but you have to get to interoperability to get to

1194
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,463
The scalability

1195
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,255
To get to profitability in the eye

1196
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,559
To space and that means people are going to have to change the

1197
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,887
The Technology's finally there it's available

1198
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,423
So it's not a technical issue

1199
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,495
At the people performance and positioning issue

1200
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,263
In my opinion

1201
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Okay

1202
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,591
I also agree with you on the standard size

1203
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
End

1204
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,687
I would say what is interesting about iot

1205
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,503
And there are parallels is

1206
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:45,087
That this is something that's going to be adopted unevenly across differ

1207
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
Industries

1208
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:46,879
In

1209
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,695
We don't actually have bass technical standards yet

1210
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,231
Which I think are really important

1211
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,791
Forgetting things at the

1212
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,095
Network layer to talk to each other

1213
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,887
Standards around security

1214
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,959
Babies in interoperability around certain types of devices

1215
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,543
But I also think we're going to have them at the industry level and

1216
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:11,199
I'm curious if you think the industry is going to adopt standards around iot faster than maybe they

1217
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,991
They did around mobile or even

1218
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
Broadband

1219
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:19,135
I would hope so I mean I I think to your point if we do a double click this on battery life

1220
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,671
To me that's not a

1221
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,951
Technical issues forum

1222
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,975
Can't be solved

1223
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,535
And that's how I think about it's a matter of

1224
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,583
A lot of times we don't understand the use

1225
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,911
I'll give a good example of a water

1226
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,983
Project in Australia where

1227
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,079
Company was spending millions of dollars sending people out text out to measure Lakes

1228
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,639
Because they had to for a commitment to build a building

1229
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
And

1230
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,455
In part because they felt like they

1231
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,271
Couldn't use wireless for some reason even though it was actually

1232
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
Fully covered

1233
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,343
And it was because

1234
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,951
The people who were tried to sell them a product it was sending a signal every 15 seconds

1235
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:57,279
Will they only send a person out there once a month to measure the depth

1236
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
The lake

1237
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:03,167
So you could put in software that would say hey if they're like one above or below this

1238
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,727
Then send a signal Center reports

1239
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,799
And I took the battery life from basically a week

1240
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,567
5 years

1241
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
So I think

1242
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,151
You have to really really really understand

1243
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,943
How the technology is going to be

1244
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,711
Applied

1245
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,503
And then figure it out

1246
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,039
I think there's been a lot of ice

1247
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
I'd say false

1248
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,343
Oh that will never work

1249
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,207
Because people haven't taken the time to really understand the technical application

1250
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,231
Are the use case

1251
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,255
Required

1252
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
Okay

1253
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,095
And that gets to this idea of resilience

1254
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:36,703
Which in the side of the world in the industrial World these are systems that are made to be

1255
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
Resilient

1256
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,775
They have backups they have

1257
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,823
Five nines it's not uncommon

1258
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,127
Even more nines is he better

1259
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,175
When we get to the tech world

1260
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:52,063
That's not always the case we are getting much better but you know it's only been a few years since you don't

1261
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
Twitter

1262
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:57,439
But go down all the time so I can't do this Facebook was just out a couple weeks ago

1263
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:04,095
How do we bring the Innovation and the kind of flexibility associated with the tech world and build that way

1264
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,911
With the resilience and redundancy needed by the

1265
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,447
The industrial world

1266
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
Match these two things

1267
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,263
Together

1268
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,311
Yeah that's a fantastic

1269
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,871
And I think it's one that also

1270
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,407
Causes people to shrivel up

1271
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,991
Because they have those user experiences with a tech

1272
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,271
World on a daily basis

1273
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,343
And so also from security breach

1274
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
So you brought

1275
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,183
Security which is also could be a technical guy

1276
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,719
To the point of is

1277
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,487
Good enough

1278
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,303
If someone can hack their way into a factory and shut it down for the day

1279
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,095
Then again

1280
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,655
The impact of that is more than someone losing their phone for

1281
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,191
Today so I think

1282
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,215
It goes in both.

1283
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,751
And I think that's

1284
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,055
Actually unique opportunity for

1285
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,847
Is Ericsson

1286
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,151
Strives for more than 5 9

1287
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,223
I understand what it means to stand up a network

1288
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,527
Working as we move into

1289
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,831
Dirt space we're doing it with that

1290
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,599
Framework

1291
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,391
So I'd say

1292
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,415
To date that hasn't

1293
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,695
Surly been the case

1294
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,767
Some other folks that they definitely that all will just stand up and that work

1295
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,047
But they don't realize it

1296
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,583
Really really difficult

1297
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,607
Computer network

1298
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,631
And redundant

1299
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,911
And Performing all of the

1300
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,727
And that's what's going to be required in order for us

1301
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,495
Austin Moon

1302
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,567
And really make the reality of iot

1303
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,847
Happen in profit

1304
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:22,687
And I think that now we're at a point where the network

1305
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
Finally with 5G

1306
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:27,551
Work will be able to provide that for these berries

1307
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,575
Specific use case

1308
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:32,671
And you'll start to see the products in the services stand up around though

1309
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,719
Not everything's going to be in the cloud

1310
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,023
I think you're going to see a lot more Edge compute

1311
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,327
If you think about what does a Industrial

1312
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,399
They're having those for today they have a computer usually

1313
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,959
Sometimes they have internet access but not always

1314
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
Cuz that's back NBA

1315
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,311
It's red so I I'm confident you'll end up with

1316
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,079
Services

1317
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,895
It notable get married and they will both be resilient

1318
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,431
Excellent

1319
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Okay

1320
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
End

1321
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,783
You keep bringing it up so let's talk about 5G

1322
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:03,391
What industries do you see adopting 5G first will it be like

1323
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,207
Consumers will it be factories with a

1324
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,743
Cars

1325
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,047
Obviously with our carrier partners

1326
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
The faster that there is

1327
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,863
Deploy Network

1328
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:19,263
It's going to be a lower cost per gigabyte than the current 4G so there's a huge incentive there even for the consumer

1329
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,311
Strongly believe that

1330
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,335
It's going to be

1331
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:28,223
A transition for the carrier partners and then for their customer So the faster we can drive that

1332
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,247
Clicker that equals 2

1333
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:35,647
System will continue involved after the carrier marketing consumers I do believe that it's going to be industrial and Autumn

1334
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,671
For sure

1335
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,231
Those are two use cases where

1336
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,511
5G create

1337
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
Competitive advantage

1338
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,327
They're not as hot sensitive when you're

1339
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,375
Turn off terabytes of data off

1340
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,143
Vehicle

1341
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,215
It has to be real time and it has to be reliable

1342
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,239
5G is the best

1343
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,031
Same thing for the end.

1344
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,359
Lipstick into the industrial use case

1345
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,151
This is because Factory floors are

1346
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,711
Horrible environments for Nerf

1347
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,527
I love the factory floor

1348
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,831
There's one of my

1349
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,111
They're horrible 4rf

1350
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:12,255
If we're talking about deploying 5G in these situations especially with

1351
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,303
At some of the higher frequency

1352
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
Spectrum

1353
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
How does that

1354
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,887
Work what will that end up looking

1355
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:21,983
And in one of the big games that the factory floor will get

1356
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,007
From deploying

1357
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
Basically five

1358
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,335
Yeah again you get the low lately

1359
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,127
You get the high throughput

1360
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,407
High performance

1361
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:33,247
It really doesn't able to the point where you can cut the cord

1362
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,551
Angular my view and my vision is

1363
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,343
Especially when you start to look at the

1364
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,367
The transformation at the

1365
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:43,231
Crying in a manufacturing environment

1366
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:48,095
I hate they want this specialized 3D printed thing for themselves they want their Uggs

1367
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,655
Was just smashed with that or they want their

1368
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,191
Invisalign or plastic

1369
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,495
If you're starting to get to an economy of one

1370
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,543
Which means manufacturing now has

1371
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
To be more specialized

1372
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,615
If you could reconfigure the facts

1373
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,639
Before and

1374
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,663
Pull and Pay

1375
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:05,503
And place different things based off of what was ordered every hour first

1376
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,807
Every month that gives you a ton of flex

1377
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,927
Now 5G if you're able to do that wirelessly at the same output

1378
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
Same

1379
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,231
Reliability and seams

1380
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,791
Security as if you had everything connected

1381
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:21,119
Then that's a huge that's a leapfrog that's a big step

1382
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,911
We're at that point now

1383
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:26,495
Partners like a TV and others were we've demonstrated the fact

1384
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,031
That you can get that thing for

1385
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,823
Performance where you haven't been able to

1386
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:30,847
With others

1387
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,895
And I know from my past

1388
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,991
Experience that we use technologies that on paper that based on science

1389
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,295
If you were to put this radio inside out

1390
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
A windmill

1391
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,599
You wouldn't have interference

1392
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,183
But once you did and I'm the window started turning in the generator started

1393
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,999
I'm annoyed that was actually created inside

1394
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,023
Giant thing

1395
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
It didn't work the Way You Are

1396
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,583
You didn't get the

1397
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
That reliable

1398
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,911
I think now you're finally at

1399
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:58,239
Point where the radio in the connectivity and a connection

1400
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,287
Is going to be able to provide

1401
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,079
The same type of

1402
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
Experience

1403
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:08,479
But you can sometimes better cuz you don't have to issue a rats or people tripping or something cutting

1404
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,271
Did you actually get a ton more

1405
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,295
Flexibility

1406
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,343
As the current user nodejs

1407
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:19,999
Yeah and I think the flexibility is a really interesting use cases I haven't thought about rats but sure rats also

1408
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,071
When you have programmable

1409
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:26,143
When you start seeing more AI on the factory

1410
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
Floors

1411
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:31,519
You can actually start moving your equipment around and reprogramming it

1412
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,311
As it were in a way that

1413
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:37,407
I don't think you could do with a wired system so I talked to a BB and

1414
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,431
A couple other

1415
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,223
Companies about that sort of thing in

1416
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,759
It's pretty exciting

1417
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:46,367
Titty transformational especially to if you start to think about yeah that's really pretty

1418
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:50,719
Space that really gives you the flexibility long-term to to have multiple discs

1419
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,487
Lines

1420
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,511
Allows

1421
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,559
La devise a ingenuity

1422
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,351
Start to find its way into Factory

1423
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,375
For which I think is

1424
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,447
Frontier it's really going to be

1425
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:03,007
The platform of the future it's just going to be redefined

1426
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:07,359
Economy in a lot of other things coming

1427
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,639
It's a lot more interesting

1428
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,687
If you're trying to find people

1429
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,967
To work at a factory

1430
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:16,319
If it is more of a robot and it looks more like a phone

1431
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,111
You're going to be able to hire them

1432
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,391
Stokes and Trainor

1433
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,927
It's a lot more effectively and efficient

1434
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,743
So I have been talking with Ericsson

1435
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,815
For probably the last five or six years by iot

1436
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:29,375
The company has really been very forward-looking

1437
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,447
In building out services in ecosystems

1438
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,471
Json

1439
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,751
I'm curious

1440
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,031
Are we there yet

1441
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:40,383
I feel like we started talking about it and things weren't real excited and then

1442
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,711
Things had a plateau where people were doing pilot projects

1443
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
Really happened

1444
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
So

1445
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,295
Do you see us

1446
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:53,183
Accelerated with iot are we still kind of at this place where we're like a lot of talk and not a lot of action

1447
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,511
Yeah I mean again I I've been here for

1448
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,535
Coming up on a month

1449
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,815
My focus is action

1450
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:02,655
For sure so you know what I love to do is to take a company from

1451
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,703
A couple hundred million to a billion

1452
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:11,103
I have faith that the core capabilities are here the core products are here we're getting a lot of traction with the carrier Park

1453
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,383
Partners and they're getting a lot of

1454
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:16,735
Pull from industrial and Enterprise Partners on wanting to do things to

1455
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,015
Differently sometimes it start

1456
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:18,783
With a

1457
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:19,807
He mentioned

1458
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:26,207
Proof of concept that we're really he's got 32 Partners in the ecosystem around the industrial space

1459
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,255
Had a ton of sick

1460
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,279
Sauce with regard

1461
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,583
To our connectivity manager

1462
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,143
Product and our device management product

1463
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:38,495
As well as our connectivity management product so we're scaling as quickly as he passed

1464
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:44,895
I think now it's a matter of can we scale as quickly as the market would like us to and I think that's where I feel

1465
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,175
Canker sore relief

1466
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:50,271
What are those use cases where we can create the most value and where

1467
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,295
Are those partners

1468
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:56,927
And partners I think that's one key thing that the internet did so well is it allowed

1469
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,951
Multiple player

1470
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,231
To win to be successful

1471
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:03,583
Now we're transitioning what I would say is a very traditional closed

1472
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,375
Systems if you think about

1473
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,167
Anna players and

1474
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,191
Oil and gas

1475
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:08,959
Or

1476
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:12,287
Even manufacturing for they sold the hardware they sold to

1477
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,079
The software and then they never let anybody else

1478
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:14,847
Now

1479
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,615
We actually have

1480
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,919
I really think about that transition

1481
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:22,527
And we have to find the right Partners that'll help us bring our products and

1482
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,575
Solutions to Market as quickly as we pop

1483
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,879
We're going to have to partner fast

1484
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,415
So I think from that

1485
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,183
Perspective

1486
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,975
It's taking our core capabilities

1487
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:33,535
Matching those up with the system integrators

1488
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:36,095
And the players in the space under

1489
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:40,191
Like I said mentioned ABB they know

1490
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,215
Factory floors

1491
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:41,983
We have a fax

1492
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,031
Before but we don't live in a fact

1493
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,847
We can connect all of the things that we need

1494
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,127
The partners to help us

1495
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:52,479
Let's get there and create that more open ecosystem that allows a lot of pee

1496
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,503
How to be success

1497
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,295
Certain product

1498
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,319
After entity so

1499
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,111
I'd say that's going to be a slightly different

1500
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,159
Lens and I think we are there

1501
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,231
Oh good cuz I've been waiting for these use cases

1502
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,279
I have been waiting for years

1503
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,839
Alright keep it thanks so much for coming on the show

1504
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:15,263
