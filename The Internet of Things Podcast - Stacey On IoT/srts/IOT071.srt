11
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,288

00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360
Which did bite the bull

00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,896
Purple

15
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,456
But first

16
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,784
Let's have a word from our sponsor

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,928
Working on building a connected product don't do it yourself it's complex and it could be years before you're up and running

18
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,464
Years you can tap

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,744

Kevin

00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,600
Ticket office in a little more exciting the death board

26
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Sorry everyone

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,160
Let's start with staples connect

28
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:40,864
Sad so here's what happened Staples connect which was one of the initial home hubs actually it launched

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,704
About the same time that revolved and SmartThings version one did

30
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,008
I actually tested all three of those

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,056
And the original Lowe's

32
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
Iris platform

33
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
73 years old

34
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
Yeah I think that was a

35
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,248
December 2013 story that I reviewed all of those so

36
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,296
Its agent in the world Electronics

37
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
But

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
It was really a great

39
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,208
Set a route to versions of it in both of them

40
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
We're awesome

41
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
These heaux

42
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,304
We were actually my favorite

43
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,864
For a long time

44
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,216
We're the ones I would recommend anyone who is kind of a beginner getting into the Smart Home

45
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
I thought that SmartThings was super fun and open but was a little more happy and you had to be a little bit more clever and know what you're you do

46
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
Doing

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,456
The Stables connect were design for mainstream customers in

48
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,552
By golly it looks like the mainstream consumers did not take them up

49
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:38,208
It's kind of a shame because in addition to being one of the first usable ones on the market usable hugs

50
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
I recall

51
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,560
Events

52
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
Where they showed off the

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,168
Staples connect display

54
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,240
And they're showing consumers how everything would work because

55
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,128
Really you know it's at the time PetSmart on Hulu with that wasn't me maybe our listeners did but the mainstream audience

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
Consumer did not

57
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:04,320
And it was one of the first I think to do a great job explaining all the benefits which products work with which how they work together

58
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
Why you want this

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,696
And it was fantastic from consumer experience standpoint but you're right

60
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
It just didn't catch on

61
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,560
It did not end a staple spokesperson

62
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Told

63
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Twice wechat

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
Is a publication

65
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
That the move was prompted by quote

66
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,216
Changing market dynamics

67
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,776
And a focus on more business-oriented solution

68
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
Unquote

69
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,384
And this makes sense so Staples actually tried to buy Office Depot

70
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,712
The FTC said no no no

71
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
They got some issues

72
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
So

73
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
They are still going to sell Smart Home Products they just aren't going to have their own branded Hub that

74
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
You know

75
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
Works with us products

76
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,584
So what but there's good news for people who do have that huh

77
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
Yes

78
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Kevin

79
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
Yes so

80
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:56,544
What Staples is doing is they are turning everything over in terms of sales and support to Zone off

81
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,152
And other Z-Wave products which is an online retailer

82
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,456
That sells obviously Z-Wave products

83
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
So that's

84
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,576
Good news for people who know how to solve love the sub

85
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
I was just not going to die

86
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,952
Like certain ones that I won't name

87
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,839
Revolve

88
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
So yes

89
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,727
Basically the continuation of your Staples connect is brought to you by the letter

90
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Z

91
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,823
I have purchased things for the Z-Wave products folks

92
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
A Z-Wave remote actually

93
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
And it works fine

94
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
Arizona

95
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Is

96
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:40,575
They've been doing this for years there actually in Kevin's backyard

97
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:45,183
You keep telling me to go visit them you've been telling me for three years they have a laugh

98
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,743
It's really cool

99
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
So I won't ask anymore Kevin

100
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,447
You're not yourself

101
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
So anyway so so tough

102
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Actually

103
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
Is how we're supposed to say it

104
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
Is

105
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Supporting this they're going to

106
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
Continue to make updates

107
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Connect app

108
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
Which

109
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,967
Is awesome because

110
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,111
You know these guys change their devices all the time so it's really actually hard to be kind of a Hubbard integrator

111
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,927
Because you have to keep up with the changing of

112
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
So that's going to still happen

113
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
It may not happen forever

114
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,143
But they will to ease the transition

115
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
Have a

116
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,519
Dedicated website which willing to in the show notes and they also have a hotline which is

117
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
1 800

118
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
380

119
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
1 V

120
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
1/8

121
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:41,503
So if you have a Staples connect system because I did recommend this way long ago

122
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,343
This is where you will get continuing help for at least a little while

123
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
And that basically leaves

124
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
Only the lows

125
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
Product

126
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,767
Out in the market as a kind of vendor

127
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
Retailer supported

128
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
Device cuz I don't know if you guys remember it was a

129
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
Flash in the pan but Best Buy had the peak

130
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
Platform

131
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
Which has disappeared

132
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
I'm sorry if you have

133
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Pink platform

134
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
I didn't get the sense that

135
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,639
So cuz that that actually have a service fee

136
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Associated with

137
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
So

138
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:18,367
Business models for the iot going forward and all these include dying

139
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
Maybe a service plan is it

140
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
So crazy

141
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
I know

142
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
Sacrilege

143
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
Blasphemy

144
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,791
So that is

145
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
The Staples news

146
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
So

147
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
Good luck to you guys

148
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
On a side note

149
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
I will say that

150
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
If you are looking for another hub

151
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,519
Because you just can't get enough hubs in your life

152
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
The wink

153
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:42,943
Is currently the Hub I'm recommending I am playing again with the SmartThings Hub it's still no

154
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,783
Not as reliable and I really wanted to be a little easier to use

155
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
So

156
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,391
It is definitely more flexible

157
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
So if you are feeling

158
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,231
Feeling it you really want to go for it

159
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
The SmartThings Hub is gray

160
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,327
If you are a hacky kind of DIY person

161
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
Just doesn't feel mainstream

162
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,591
Yes it's true I am still happy with my winky know by comparison to everything else so

163
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Sacraments

164
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,479
Well yeah and an even more surprising because of you know

165
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
GE quirky

166
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
Getting selling off wings

167
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,415
2 flags and there was concern there what about the product without the support or the service

168
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,231
I don't feel like it's affected me at all

169
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
So

170
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
And

171
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,375
I've been traveling a lot this summer but very soon I will have wink relays in my house

172
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
I've gotten some feedback from the snow

173
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,495
And they say that they love them so

174
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,055
Is it a little touch screen $99

175
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
In-wall pennies right

176
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,919
So those aren't those are coming

177
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
I was going to send them to Kevin

178
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783
Oh I like that idea okay

179
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
What's happened to Kevin

180
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
Although then we'll hear the review three years

181
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
Sounds

182
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,535
Let's go onto now will do that for

183
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
Kevin you found a really cool price

184
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
Interesting yeah it is a Kickstarter

185
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,335
Project keep that in mind when I make that caveats beforehand but

186
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,127
Pretty little as $5

187
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,455
You can get a little development board for iot

188
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
The Omega 2

189
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:26,111
There are tons and tons of add-ons for this thing I'm very impressed by all the add-ons

190
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:32,511
It's super small it's about a quarter of the size of a Raspberry Pi a third the size of an Arduino

191
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
Uno so it is pretty small

192
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,399
Tons of expansion packs as I mentioned runs with Linux

193
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
As a remote

194
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,007
Integration Clinic call it Cloud integrated so that you can

195
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,847
Remote control to it from anywhere in the world using the onion cloud

196
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:53,247
You can do the status of it real time you can deploy software updates to it when it's in the fields that's interesting

197
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,087
Start expandability has Wi-Fi built in I believe

198
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,903
You can add Bluetooth you can add cellular to it

199
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,719
Maven connected to an Arduino

200
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:07,071
Tons and tons of Integrations here so I'd like this for people who want to

201
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,935
Tinker with iot Solutions on the cheap basically I mean

202
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,519
You have to stay out on boards and you start talking about some serious money but

203
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
For five bucks and get started

204
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:24,223
Okay and I was like the onion Cloud I have not heard about that but it's it's it's cloudy

205
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
It's actually for Debbie

206
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Made by the

207
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
Not the satirical

208
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Journalistic

209
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,487
Playset type of this is an onion. IO

210
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,911
You're not living your best iot

211
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
Sorry

212
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Broken it

213
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
Okay

214
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
Speaking of death boards

215
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,591
My devices the company that makes Cayenne

216
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
Which is a easy to use programming

217
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
Eat language for iot

218
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
Partnered with Arduino

219
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
So now they support the rest

220
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,831
Pi and Arduino which

221
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,903
Alarm I listen to send me emails that I didn't read

222
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
And they like

223
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
Cayenne

224
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
You know if you're one of those people

225
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
Now works with Arduino

226
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
Then finally

227
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,655
Particle the company that makes

228
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
The photon and

229
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,495
Other

230
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
I'm trying to think of the name

231
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
The spark

232
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
Scorpius

233
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
Parkour parkour

234
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
And in the photon which has the cellular can

235
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Activity

236
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
I believe

237
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
They have a cloud

238
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Which

239
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:36,159
I may be honest guys I really thought they always had a cloud because you connected your bored and sent data to their claw

240
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
To somewhere

241
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:43,327
They formally announced it last week and they also have built-in Integrations with Microsoft

242
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Azure

243
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Google

244
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,983
Their cloud of infrastructure if this and that and some other places so now it's

245
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,335
More fully functioning for Enterprises in comedies like Keurig

246
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
And

247
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Cleverpet

248
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Use it so

249
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
There you go

250
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
Particle

251
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
That much more legit

252
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
And that

253
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,343
Cats are deaf for the day

254
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
Let's see what should we cover next

255
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:12,511
Wheaties it at the beginning some interesting iot data points in terms of the carrier's

256
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,839
Oh yes so this is for my friend Chetan Sharma who

257
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
Is a wheelchair we do

258
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
He's a wonderful person and he's a

259
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
Really kick butt analyst

260
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,567
If you're if you're needing data about carriers Chetan Sharma Consulting

261
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,431
She tells us Kevin actually you should do the

262
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
So I clocked out

263
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,087
Freaky datapoints at lemon chatting if anybody's ever read his

264
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
Analytical reports

265
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
It's like volumes of information

266
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
So I just went in and

267
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
Snagged a couple

268
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
Of interesting points

269
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:49,375
First one for the first time I O T which includes bathing suit and connected cars

270
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:54,495
Net ads for carriers exceeded the net ads for phones and tablets combined

271
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,567
I guess it's a little I don't to say obvious but

272
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
A little unsurprisingly

273
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,175
Phone and tablet ads have been slowing

274
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,247
Did you see that with my

275
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,807
Like Apple's iPhone sales that's been like the big

276
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
Topic of conversation in the last

277
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
Everyone likes that

278
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Transition

279
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,303
These numbers would higher than these numbers for the first time ever

280
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Now

281
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:25,471
In terms of AT&T there connected-car onboarding pace is twice that of its connected tablet space

282
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,287
What's a wheat back to order sign up with saturation

283
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
But

284
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,639
Other interesting number AT&T is expected to reach 10 million

285
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,199
Connected car subscriptions very soon

286
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
Repeat in roughly twelve quarters

287
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,039
From the time you first started doing it

288
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
Compare 25 quarters

289
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
Super tablet so

290
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,439
They're just getting their of their chips and servicing cars

291
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
Quickly

292
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,095
I still don't I have connected car options in my two vehicles I just don't use them talk about that II

293
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
I don't want to

294
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,191
Prepaid Verizon their iot and telematics

295
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,031
Is risen 25% year-over-year 205 million dollars

296
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:05,663
Which chance has hey we're getting close to 1 billion dollar a year run rate in that business for Verizon which is

297
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,479
No small amount of chump change that's very

298
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
Cricket

299
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
More context

300
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
Before we talk about connect

301
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,135
Okay AT&T achieved according to chat

302
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
A $1000000

303
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,767
Verizon is playing catch-up

304
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,583
AT&T is the master when it comes to connecting

305
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
In cars

306
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
Tesla

307
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
Chrysler they have

308
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
Bunch of brands

309
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,847
So they really won this and I think actually a lot of people say that

310
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,175
AT&T ability to get Tesla is what

311
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,247
Prompted a lot of other carriers to say what

312
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,087
We should really be talking all this connected thing people cuz we danced out on

313
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,927
Okay Kevin tell us why you don't

314
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,767
So I guess I struggle with with

315
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
The business model from a consumer standpoint

316
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,095
I'm

317
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:00,959
I've already got a phone with LTE or maybe after for phones my whole family is with me

318
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
In the car

319
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
Why am I going to

320
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,151
Make a hotspot here in my car why am I why do I need that connectivity

321
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
When I

322
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
Sorry

323
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
No no eye mask

324
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
Cuz mine

325
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
Mycompass

326
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
Okay

327
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
I love the

328
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,647
The fact that my car so

329
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:25,535
Again I'm not trying to lay first world problems people are like Beavis and you said I do

330
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
Has an AT&T

331
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
Connection

332
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,471
I don't actually have autopilot Earl out of the fan

333
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
Fancy Feet

334
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Or that

335
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
Tesla pays for the

336
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,943
An index the difference the car would be

337
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:48,319
Almost useless so I actually have this thing because they're at their like we're going to pay for it for the first I think it's seven year

338
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Of the car

339
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
Anime

340
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:56,511
AT&T hasn't even set pricing for what it would be afterwards in Tesla's actually like

341
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,583
I talk to my friends have you know 2013

342
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
Models in there like

343
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
Yeah I don't even

344
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
So

345
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
Without

346
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,007
Connectivity though if I have to pay for it

347
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
My car becomes

348
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
But useless but

349
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
It becomes less exciting

350
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,431
Unless like a luxury vehicle that I paid a lot of

351
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
Right and

352
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
I think

353
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,343
Did they should be taking the Kindle model on these things because

354
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,647
When you're buying a car now

355
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,951
Most people are thinking they're buying

356
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Computer

357
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
So

358
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,047
If you're actually buying a computer than

359
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,375
You just got to have the connectivity is part of it in the manufacturer needs to pay

360
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,983
That's that's my gut sense and then they can limited all they want they probably like

361
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
I can't stream Netflix in my test

362
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
And that's fine by me

363
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
So that that's my two cents

364
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,735
So I think the big difference is

365
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,783
Hazlet is probably an outlier

366
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,855
In that it's including the LTE

367
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
For you

368
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,415
Where is my new Volkswagen

369
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,231
I got a trial for 6 months

370
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
Which includes

371
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,327
Security in that features and so on so forth so

372
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,399
But after that you do have to pay and I think that's probably more of them

373
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
Prevalent model

374
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
Should it be that model Maybe not maybe

375
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
You know

376
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,311
Didn't going on your take on the Kindle model

377
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,383
Maybe it's just be there should be connected I don't know

378
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
I just think so much like

379
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,479
How are they going to do it over there updated that's not

380
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
There

381
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,183
Stock cars are going to need those so my guess is they could do that and they just cover the data charges through the

382
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:34,815
Carrier directly I never know about it we just pushing update will you get your vehicle updated at the dealership

383
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:41,983
Dealership dealership

384
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,799
Amazon Prime for car updates please

385
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,919
Got me a USB with all the data I don't do that

386
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
All right

387
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
So those are the fun datapoint

388
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
A bit about Canada

389
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
I wonder if maybe luxury cars have this

390
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,391
So anybody out there who's got like a

391
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,719
I don't know BMW or a high-end Mercedes with lots of fancy stuff on them

392
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,047
Let us know info at iot podcast. Com

393
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,351
Because I'm very curious like

394
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
Are we going to have this model wear

395
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
User-pays or wear manufacturer pays because the

396
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,823
I connected features are so much part of the selling point with a car

397
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,431
Okay we're going to run from connected cars to security but before we do that

398
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,223
There's a new toy in town

399
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
It is the

400
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,575
Logitech

401
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
Home switch

402
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,439
It is a $40

403
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
Programmable button

404
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:40,351
That will work with your Logitech Harmony but also many of your other smart devices

405
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
In the home

406
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,679
And you can program it to basically

407
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
Beaverton

408
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,263
Anything you want like goodnight house

409
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
Click the button

410
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Turn on lights

411
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
You can actually do

412
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,711
Different presses a single press a double press in a long press

413
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
So this is kind of like

414
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
The Philips Hue tap

415
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,087
For many many moons ago

416
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:05,439
But it works with other things and it also can it has an app that

417
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,767
The text all the other devices in your house so you don't actually have to like

418
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
Fiddle around with

419
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
Like what you do have to put all around

420
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
Now that I think about it is just

421
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
Hit it send it send it starts

422
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,543
$40 there is a starter pack for

423
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,895
$100 but we're not sure yet what's in the starter pack in with multiple pops

424
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,967
Or what but normally I'm not a fan of AC

425
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
However

426
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,551
I could see myself spending $40

427
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
One in the main reason why

428
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,743
Nobody in the family likes using the echo to turn lights on and turn lights off other than make so they sit there

429
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,791
Is there anyway I can you turn up the lights on

430
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
Yes really

431
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,399
They don't like talking to the device or devices

432
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,983
So I would spend the $40 at this point because it's so aggravating

433
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
But I will just

434
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
Spend $40

435
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
And get them a button

436
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
That turns lights on and off basically

437
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,431
All the switches I just replace after we replace with a smart button

438
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
What weight you should switch

439
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,063
Okay I'm so confused they won't get up and go to the switch

440
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,623
I mean if you're not going to talk to something you might as well like this

441
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
Suck it up and

442
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
Well these are non switches their lamps

443
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,375
All right we'll see

444
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,911
Because here's my dream

445
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,007
Actually I wouldn't buy it cuz I now have a DOT by my bed but

446
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,055
Actually

447
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,919
It's a great fun thing to have a button by your bed that like turns off

448
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Regular

449
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,527
Is done and I actually played with the Hue tap but it didn't

450
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
Control anything other than the lights

451
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
So that was kind

452
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
It was fun to have it for

453
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
Controlling lights with this

454
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,303
Lock up the Fortress turn off the lights turn on the cameras

455
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
Everything happen

456
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
So

457
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,423
Right now the echo doesn't work with all of my stuff

458
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,519
It's not clear a Logitech actually has a lot of good stuff it works with

459
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
More so than the echo

460
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,591
Actually it works also with the echo

461
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
So

462
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,895
Maybe you could be like

463
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,687
She who shall not be named

464
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
Activate my pop button

465
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
That would be so fun

466
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
Are we done it

467
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
Anyway

468
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
I'm just being silly this way

469
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
But with this thing

470
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,647
I think it actually would

471
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
I like button

472
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
And my daughter likes button so

473
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,071
She's got this thing where she doesn't want quote-unquote robots in a room

474
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,655
But maybe if I just gave her the button instead of she hits it things happen

475
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,727
She's she's pretty smart she probably realize it was a robot

476
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
Kick it out but

477
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
I like it

478
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
I Would by One in a heart

479
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
And probably will

480
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,199
The other thing I know about this is

481
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:39,039
This is great for people that babysitters because it ties into the

482
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,831
Logitech Harmony Hub

483
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:45,183
Which if you program that correctly you know you can actually have your TV come on

484
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
Dial with one button

485
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
So you ready

486
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,047
You can create those kind of setting so like

487
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
One button is cable

488
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
2 buttons

489
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
Is

490
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,167
Video three buttons is

491
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,703
Your house is on fire in Everett

492
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,495
When she get out so that would be

493
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:04,127
Really nice for people who got parents are guests who come in or let go and God your TV Soca

494
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Complicated

495
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
Flix and chill.

496
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
That is a Logitech

497
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,039
And now we should talk about

498
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
Hackable

499
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,111
They're not hackable buttons they're hackable a

500
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,672
Kevin brought up the story about 75

501
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
Bluetooth smart locks

502
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
Can be hacked

503
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:24,352
And later on I'm going to tell you all the locks that were hacked and I'm going to tell you August

504
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
Response

505
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,680
Cuz they're a popular

506
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,496
Play the one with the most mindshare I don't know if they're

507
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
The one with

508
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,568
But the most market share.

509
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
Kwikset locks

510
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
They were not in the way

511
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
But

512
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
I am aware that

513
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,992
Kwikset lock is really easy to open

514
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
You know if you have a screwdriver and you just want to open

515
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
Sorry Kevin I know you

516
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:53,024
No you know it's working really well for me but yeah if it's at the highest grade Quality Security oppressor

517
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
Install.

518
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
Connect to Schlage lock I was like oh

519
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,888
This is way better

520
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
Okay

521
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,752
Let's see Kevin did you see anything you wanted to bring up about Defcon

522
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,568
No I mean just a general comment I always

523
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,128
Fringe this time of the year when we have black hat

524
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,432
Defcon and all these security things because

525
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,064
That's when all of these reports come out in and N people researchers have been sitting on

526
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,160
Security issues for possibly 3 for 6 months whatever it is

527
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,952
It's like the scariest time of the year

528
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,792
So kind of cringe mean it's a good thing that they're doing what they're doing but

529
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,096
Universe just tons of Doom and Gloom

530
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
Things that came out

531
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,680

Hey guys it's Stacey

559
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:55,136
Before we get to Bo Woods I did want to jump in with the correction from last week

560
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,976
Last week we talked about Phillips in their new line of medical devices

561
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
Watch

562
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,048
A body scale

563
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,352
ABP monitor blood pressure monitor

564
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
And an ear thermometer

565
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:11,264
When I spoke about them I said that they were FDA approved but that wasn't actually true

566
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:16,896
Two of them the healthwatch in the body scale are listed with the FDA as a medical device

567
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,688
It's kind of a lower bar

568
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,736
For them to clear it basically just means

569
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,552
Not be duplicitous

570
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,624
And be suitable for intended uses and

571
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,672
Be properly labeled

572
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
That's worth

573
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:35,840
So that is kind of what that means and then the other three devices that your thermometer and the

574
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
Blood pressure monitors

575
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
Both the wrist and the arm

576
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,216
Are medically cleared devices

577
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:47,616
And that means that the FDA has determined that they are substantially equivalent to another legally marketed medical device

578
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,688
That is what you need to know

579
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,968
Not approved

580
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
But

581
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,016
Listed and clear

582
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
Thanks

583
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
Now on TiVo

584
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
Today's guest is Bo Woods

585
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:04,256
Who has a what is a deputy director of the cyber statecraft

586
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
Initiative for the Atlantic

587
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
Council

588
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,632
Thanks for being here

589
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,448
Can you tell us what that means and normal people language

590
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,032
Thank you Stacey it's good to be on again with you so

591
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,872
I have a long background in the information security community and Industry

592
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
When

593
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
I came to the Atlantic Council

594
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,736
Did so because I was going to hopefully

595
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:31,136
I'll be able to bring some of the technical literacy to public policy makers who are making decisions about technology that

596
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,440
Influences of everyday things like cars

597
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
Medical devices

598
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,512
Critical infrastructure

599
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
We probably need a lot of fat

600
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
In the public policy

601
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,632
Is fear and actually all over the place

602
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
You talked about

603
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,032
9 points

604
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
A little bit safer

605
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
You should it was awesome

606
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,480
Is back in March

607
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
Now we're here because

608
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,576
Bo was at Defcon

609
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
Last week

610
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,696
And there's a lot of iot

611
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,024
Just in general a lot of people testing the boundaries of

612
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,816
Cyber security

613
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,144
Impressions

614
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
On the show

615
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,544
Yeah sure so I was out there all week long it was a grueling August in Vegas

616
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,128
Is pretty hot but visited the b-sides Las Vegas

617
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,480
Security conferences well as Defcon and heard about some of the things that went on at blackhat

618
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,784
Like you said there was lots of iot hacking

619
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,928
Overall it seems like the level of it hacking is going way up I helped to run the contest

620
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
Storages in advance

621
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
Defcon

622
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,024
And that's where we

623
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
Held

624
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,328
Car hacking Village

625
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,144
It Village and biohacking

626
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,960
I got to say cracking Village was pack

627
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,008
Wall2wall all three days

628
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,312
There was so much good content

629
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,616
A lot of people would set up

630
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,408
Demonstrations and workshops

631
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,688
But they were doing

632
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,344
They had a special badge this year that was in the shape of a car and it had an OBD2 connect

633
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
Electronic that you can use to

634
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,720
I checked in your car and reach of the day off and then as well as to do some other things

635
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,280
Okay wait

636
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
I do like no

637
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,424
Mysterious nefarious labs

638
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,984
Yeah well who knows

639
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,128
Who knows what's really in it the real hackers will go and don't have the Curiosity to dig in and find out what's on those

640
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:28,896
Pcbs

641
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,688
That's what everybody else

642
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,968
Yeah

643
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,528
Plugging something into your car unknown provenance

644
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,320
Might not be the best idea

645
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
You're planning to do it for test purposes

646
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
Go ahead

647
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,208
Security tip number one

648
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:46,560
For you don't plug strange things cars computers and other

649
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,840
General Life advice

650
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,704
It said the car was a big thing

651
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,496
Did you see anything

652
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
The guys who did the Jeep hack

653
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
We're back

654
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,640
And I'm curious the ones who stopped a Jeep

655
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:04,736
Everyone is very excited about it

656
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
They wanted to

657
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,600
Actually I think it was control the brakes of a car

658
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,136
This time around

659
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,696
Did you see anything for them where they impressive

660
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
Yes so I I

661
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,560
Wasn't able to attend their talk

662
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,864
But I heard a lot about it as you can imagine

663
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
The last time

664
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680
They did a demo

665
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,240
Are they kill the engine on a highway in

666
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
St.Louis

667
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,848
And then brought it off the highway to do some other things with it

668
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:34,432
This year they were back and they were demonstrating how they could

669
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,016
Do a lot of the same things that they were able to do in

670
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,552
Very slow speed

671
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,344
At actually very fast

672
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,160
So they seem to

673
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,232
Automatically go through every year and try and bust myth

674
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,560
I hate to miss it was busted this time was that

675
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,096
The only car hacking

676
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,400
Make it happen of turning the steering wheel

677
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:59,008
We have to be at a very very slow speed and therefore it would be consequential on

678
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,824
Highways and things like that so it couldn't be a

679
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,616
A broader Public Safety minutes

680
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,176
It could only be something that was done in a lab

681
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:06,944
Accentuate

682
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,528
And white Christmas Charlie showed is that that was not the case

683
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
That they could do it at speed

684
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
And it could cause

685
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,136
Type of large-scale

686
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,440
Highway denial-of-service if you will

687
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,024
That would be things like massive traffic jams right

688
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,328
I think that one was

689
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
With much-talked-about

690
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
I got a lot of coverage

691
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
Okay so

692
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,984
Just for those of us who are like

693
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,008
Holy cow

694
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,288
That's scary

695
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
What should automakers do

696
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,152
Should I would actually tell me first should I worry

697
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,456
Well I think Douglas Adams said it best

698
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
I said Don't Panic

699
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
Grab your crying towel

700
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
And

701
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:48,672
Just do it the fact that these things are both true and scary and also not likely to affect you at Lee

702
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,952
At least not anytime soon

703
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,512
So while there should be a large degree of

704
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,792
Awareness

705
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:57,376
Among consumers LeBlanc automakers is on policymakers

706
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,704
I don't think it's time to go out and stop buying cars right

707
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:07,616
The worst thing you could probably do is to buy an older model car that has less safety gear

708
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,664
Rather than a newer model

709
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,712
A car which has more safety gear

710
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:15,808
But in which there's more chance of an exotic

711
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,648
Type of failure of security failure from

712
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,952
Newer cars have lots of cool gear

713
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
That keeps you safe on the roads

714
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,840
The older cars don't fare as well and some of the performance testing

715
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,120
That way

716
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,936
Because of the the great capabilities that

717
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,752
Computer system to call activity can actually bring

718
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:39,616
So I think that's the number one lesson is that we want to preserve Trust

719
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
It is more safe

720
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
Vehicles

721
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Okay

722
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,968
So don't panic

723
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,856
Buy a newer car as opposed to one that has no technical things because it's probably going to be packed with safety gear that is

724
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
More likely to save your life than someone is to hack

725
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:59,328
Yep that's right and just a brief aside there was also another talk about

726
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
Autonomous vehicles

727
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
And

728
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,936
The national highway traffic safety administration

729
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,216
Ministration Nitsa

730
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:09,056
Measures the number of deaths per year at around 35000

731
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
200

732
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:15,456
I am like 94% of those are caused by human error of some sort so

733
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,016
Let's be single.

734
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,576
I ended up where it was related to an autonomy

735
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
Driving vehicle

736
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,672
I'm not even fully autonomous just driver-assist

737
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
I believe that's what caused it

738
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
And there

739
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,792
Still very bullish

740
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,584
On the idea of having

741
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,656
This driver assist feature because it will save lives

742
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,752
So as we look at these types of things that make headlines

743
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,288
If you want to talk about

744
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,592
It's also important to keep those in contacts

745
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
So if there's

746
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,152
One death per day

747
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:49,504
Drum driver assist vehicle but there's 80 deaths per day

748
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,528
From a

749
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,576
Non driver assist vehicles

750
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:58,720
Then keeping that it within context helps us see the bigger broader impact

751
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,280
Improved rather than

752
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
Decrease safety

753
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,144
So now

754
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,472
There were tons of exciting hacks

755
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,496
What's the most

756
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,568
I think the one that got the most headlines was probably

757
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
The Bluetooth locks being hacked

758
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,152
And this was

759
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,200
Someone who hacked

760
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,784
I see it was 12 out of 16 available Bluetooth lock

761
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,320
And

762
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
2

763
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,792
So what is your take

764
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,120
Yeah that all sounds really scary but

765
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,400
There's actually a Lockpick

766
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:43,264
Village where they can teach you to do more effective techniques against a broader array of locks

767
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
From the same distance

768
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,848
That is right next to a door

769
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,664
That within some certain proximity of it

770
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
A lot faster

771
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,224
With the traditional

772
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
So

773
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,040
While the Bluetooth

774
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
Lock hack

775
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,112
Is definitely scary and there's some

776
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
Very basic hygiene

777
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,184
Seems like. Missed

778
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,464
Those on the

779
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,560
The computer side the Bluetooth side and the beauty logic

780
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
Processed as well as on

781
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,144
Basic physical gear

782
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
Like you mentioned

783
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
Screwdriver can let you in

784
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,728
That's your

785
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,568
Well that's the level of physical security that you're putting into these days

786
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,384
It's no wonder that some of the computer

787
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
Security stuff is not

788
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:26,272
But again to put that in perspective somebody's got to be really close to it

789
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,808
And if they're really close to it

790
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,088
They can just smash them

791
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Yeah

792
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,280
There's someone

793
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,168
Yeah so the real security that most of these blocks

794
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
Provide

795
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,008
Is that the delay of someone getting in

796
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
So it

797
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,848
Hopefully gives you time to detect them and respond to it

798
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,176
Or it stops a casual person

799
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
Being able to get in

800
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,480
Undetected

801
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,528
If somebody smashes your door

802
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
To get in

803
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
Rob you

804
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,112
Then obviously that leaves a trail

805
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,928
You're able to get in by picking the lock or by

806
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,232
Breaking the Bluetooth locking mechanism

807
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,304
And there's no detective capability you don't know someone

808
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,072
Was in there

809
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
To be

810
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Your worst

811
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,960
In some cases that might be worse than more disturbing than two

812
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,008
Not your door off its hinges

813
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,288
Somebody's kicked it up

814
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,128
Yes it could still be in the house every babysitters nightmare

815
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
Adjust for Alyssa

816
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,944
Some of the

817
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,224
Step were hacked

818
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
Were made by quick luck

819
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
Iblue lock

820
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
Plant Rico

821
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,344
COV

822
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,392
El cycle

823
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,696
Okie dokie and mesh motion

824
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,512
I did reach out to August

825
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
Maker of the

826
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072
Ever-popular August locks

827
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,864
And they said

828
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,216
August locks use AES encryption Cipher Block Chain on top of the standard blue

829
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Encryption

830
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,800
And they've actually been working with

831
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,616
Those hackers for a while now just to make sure there's

832
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
Ask yourself

833
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
If you have an August lock

834
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,456
About it

835
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,736
If you have one of those other locks

836
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
Hayfield Lesco

837
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,648
The floor we also saw the first ransomware

838
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,952
On a thermostat I believe

839
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,000
Is this something I should worry about

840
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,816
Yes first demonstrated rants

841
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,376
Somewhere on a thermostat so this is

842
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
It's essentially

843
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:23,008
Research and the researchers did a proof-of-concept demonstration

844
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Which is

845
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,592
Maybe not something that's viable in real life

846
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,664
Now you don't have to worry about the exact structure that they use

847
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,224
Which required physical access to the device

848
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,504
Security card

849
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
Buckets

850
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,296
Type of thing

851
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,344
Is very similar to actually the last

852
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,136
Thing I was on your show talking about Stacey

853
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,696
Witches in some of the coming

854
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,000
Potential problems in the Internet of Things

855
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,560
When you're connecting everything to the internet

856
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,912
And it software wasn't built to be connected to the internet it wasn't designed to resist

857
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,704
Accidental adversaries

858
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:56,032
Then it's potentially susceptible to any type

859
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:01,664
The specific one demonstrated here wasn't real they didn't release it into the wild

860
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:07,552
However what it did is it essentially set your thermostat on some consistent level and said

861
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,344
NBA Bitcoin

862
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,136
Or you'll never be able to change

863
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,672
The temperature again

864
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,232
Which is actually a common type of technique

865
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,560
Used in other computer systems and we've actually seen it

866
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:25,216
Accidentally hit some healthcare equipment and the researchers he reported that same type of capability

867
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
To a new platform

868
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,032
Type of pots

869
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,920
And there's a growing body of evidence to suggest that this type of attack holding

870
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
Home systems for ransom

871
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,504
Might actually be something that's coming

872
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
The future

873
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,576
Secure spannabis a robot

874
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,624
Dirty saw that in the first episode of

875
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
Reason why season 2

876
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,696
Where a smart home was

877
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,488
Essentially entirely taken over

878
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
And if you're watching the

879
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
Mr. robot show

880
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,120
And did you read the document that we put out in

881
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
March

882
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
On

883
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,960
Smart Homes in the internet of everything

884
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,264
We had a kind of Doomsday scenario and

885
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:03,360
Which looks a lot like the mr. robot scenario which is going to need to have predicted

886
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,384
Mr. robot

887
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,432
Maybe they just stole it

888
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:12,320
Listeners by the way I will link in the show notes to the episode that but was on so

889
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,624
If you're if you want to lose some sleep

890
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648
You can go listen to that

891
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,232
Make a secure you should go

892
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
So

893
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Absolutely

894
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,096
Physical access because this is something

895
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,888
I feel like when I think about

896
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,424
Securing connected devices

897
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,192
Stairs

898
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,752
Can I have to ask myself is this

899
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
Physical access

900
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
Desperate

901
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
Is this a threat

902
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,128
From the wireless radios like

903
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,432
Pekin overheard a man-in-the-middle type attacks

904
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
Is this a threat

905
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,296
Like getting my data or passwords from someone else's

906
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,088
In Astoria still in the cloud

907
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
Or is this

908
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
Let's see

909
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,720
I don't know what else there is what other category should I be worried about

910
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
If I'm thinking about this like as a

911
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
Normal consumer

912
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,888
Right so there's many different levels to take on

913
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,960
Because you kind of talked about the physical access

914
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,824
One thing to keep in mind is a lot of the radio that are typically used

915
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,104
Talking to this thing

916
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,128
Such as Bluetooth

917
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,664
Have a certain range

918
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944
Thursday

919
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,992
Normal range that is supposed to work in

920
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,064
And then there's the Amplified rain

921
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,160
Which I think the research has demonstrated a quarter of mile to isn't the Bluetooth

922
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:20,928
Assistance

923
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,952
Are the some of the

924
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,024
That's a larger threat surface

925
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,072
Or potential number of attackers

926
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,424
Then if it's a physical thing where you need a screwdriver to get in

927
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,216
But it's also a smaller

928
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,240
Attack surface

929
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,800
At War number of physical attackers

930
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,896
Then something that's connected to the internet where it could be

931
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
Attacked by a new

932
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,712
The five billion or so people

933
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
You have access to the

934
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,064
This is one of the interesting parts of

935
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
Looking at

936
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
Smart devices

937
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,928
Is as weekend the model

938
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Home lock

939
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:58,048
We assume that someone will be right there don't need to be right there to jump

940
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
To defeat that lock

941
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
On the internet

942
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,656
Someone could be anywhere in the world so

943
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
The number of potential attacker

944
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
This way up

945
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,800
And as we know in most cases it only takes one person

946
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,616
With an internet connection who wants to do something

947
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
To be able to pull it off

948
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,968
Know that sounds really scary until you think

949
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,344
What is the good of having someone unlock my door unless they're actually outside my house

950
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,928
That's a great question and I think we've

951
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,208
Come to the point where

952
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,744
We no longer have to ask

953
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
Can we do some

954
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
Talking with technology

955
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,840
But we haven't yet started to ask

956
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
In all cases

957
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
Should we

958
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,400
Judas with the type

959
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,960
I think that might be the growing

960
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
Question that

961
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,008
Manufacturers

962
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,544
Should be asking you that

963
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,824
Consumers more important

964
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,848
We should be asking

965
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,896
Do I want this device

966
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,176
To be unlocked

967
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,968
Do I want my front door to be unlocked

968
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,504
From anyone on the internet

969
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,296
Or is it sufficient

970
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,344
Stop someone right there doing it

971
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
Highway

972
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,648
Bluetooth

973
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,928
Or with it

974
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,208
Number combination

975
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
Warwick Davis

976
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
God forbid a physical lock

977
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,864
I have one

978
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:09,472
That's kind of good to think about I actually have had

979
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
Milocks

980
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,288
So I have a Kwikset zwave lock

981
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,360
And I have them attached to a wink hub

982
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:19,456
And I had a lovely hacker come over to my house hack into my wink hub

983
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,784
And through that he actually was able to unlock my

984
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,808
Z-Wave locks

985
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
And I was like

986
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,112
Suck

987
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,696
It didn't take him quite some time and

988
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:33,024
To be fair I did have to give him my Wifi password

989
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,608
It was a bit of a contrived situation

990
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
2Xtreme

991
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,496
So if we're not worried about Bluetooth locks

992
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,032
We might be worried about rants

993
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,872
Which I would die if someone took over my thermostat and said you know

994
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,896
You can't have it

995
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,200
Set it to anything about like 77 in

996
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Summer

997
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
So

998
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,552
What else did you see anything else there that you're like

999
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
Oh man

1000
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,856
We should also worry about this

1001
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
Maybe on the medical device

1002
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,184
Well I'll tell you this

1003
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
Maybe not

1004
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:06,304
Hey we should worry about this but I saw a lot of things going on with

1005
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
Here's what we can do to

1006
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
Did you better

1007
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,400
And one of those was at

1008
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,192
Bsides Las Vegas

1009
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,472
I am the cavalry

1010
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
I'm also part of

1011
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
I had a track

1012
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
On

1013
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,336
Any updates

1014
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,384
So what the landscape look like

1015
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,664
As well as an attempt

1016
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,432
To come to some

1017
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,224
Really good profound

1018
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,040
Discoveries about what we will need in order

1019
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,832
Virtu at scale

1020
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,368
Ensure that

1021
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,416
Technology that has the ability to

1022
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,464
Impact Public Safety in human life

1023
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,256
That is worthy of the trace

1024
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
The trust that we place in it

1025
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
So

1026
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,704
The details of that you can check out through videos which will soon be released by besides

1027
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,824
But I think we made a lot of good progress on figuring out what each of the stakeholders

1028
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,616
In that ecosystem

1029
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,663
Including buyers can potentially do

1030
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,455
I took make sure that

1031
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,735
They're more secure and

1032
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,503
More safe

1033
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,343
Okay so do you want to give me like the top two things

1034
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
Buyers can do

1035
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Sure

1036
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,719
We already talked about one of them witches don't panic

1037
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,279
Understand things in their contacts

1038
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,351
And understand that when you're getting a

1039
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
Driver-assist

1040
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,911
Type vehicle that

1041
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,703
Can automatically pilot you around

1042
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,263
That a single exotic death

1043
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,055
Or single exoticaxxx

1044
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,359
Should not offset the games

1045
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,151
From the many many Monday in Acts

1046
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,175
Consider prevent

1047
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,735
Another thing is to going to ask question

1048
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,527
For Physicians

1049
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,647
You are looking at new medical devices are hospitals are looking at new medical devices

1050
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
Or patient

1051
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,743
Ask whoever is in the conversation with you

1052
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,535
What's the safety what's the f

1053
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,839
To see what's the security of this device

1054
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,167
Same thing goes for people buying home devices

1055
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,959
No ask at the store

1056
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,495
It turns out as we

1057
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,823
Talked about last time I believe the customer is asking it

1058
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,847
Store-level

1059
00:42:55,103 --> 00:43:00,991
Is actually a really good lover to be able to go back to the manufacturers and say hey everybody's asked me about this

1060
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,271
What do I tell them

1061
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:06,367
And then maybe a third thing is to look for certain indicators

1062
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,903
Security measures are

1063
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
Precautions

1064
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:13,791
So if you look for things like coordinated vulnerability disclosure program

1065
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,327
It's a manufacturer

1066
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,607
Makes available

1067
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,167
It seems an indicator to the market that

1068
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,703
We're very confident safety

1069
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,983
Security of our products

1070
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,031
To the point where we invite people who

1071
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,055
Find flaws in

1072
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:25,823
DFCS

1073
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,383
Tell us about them so that we can make them better

1074
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,943
Okay cuz I was like what the what

1075
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,759
I don't even know what that is but you're talking about a bug Bounty Pro

1076
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:40,415
Bug bounties one instantiation a bug Bounty is a system where a company pays researchers

1077
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,207
4 flaws and they find

1078
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,047
There's another one which has a lower bar which basically just says

1079
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,607
We won't see you if you report in good faith

1080
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,239
So there's lots of people who are out there using their devices and accidentally run across flaws

1081
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,031
In certain cases

1082
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:02,431
Manufacturers have either ignored reports of this laws or have actively tried to sue researchers or others

1083
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,711
Fishing report those laws

1084
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,527
So I message from the manufacturer that says

1085
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,599
We won't sue you because we believe that our customers

1086
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,135
Must be protected

1087
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,927
Against these types of laws

1088
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,463
Yeah that's a good indicator

1089
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
Okay

1090
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,255
So super fast

1091
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,303
If I

1092
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:23,167
If your manufacturer look to build in Safety and Security in Europe

1093
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,191
Tire design

1094
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
Life cycle

1095
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,263
Take reports of flaws or

1096
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,311
Defects from those who find them

1097
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,591
And work with them

1098
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,639
And third make sure that your

1099
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,175
Products are updatable

1100
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
So that

1101
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,015
When there is something better way that snow nor

1102
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,295
Aeroflot it's found

1103
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,111
You can respond to that and at least

1104
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,647
Make the fix available

1105
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
All right

1106
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,975
Are there are there other

1107
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,023

Yes

1110
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,143
For policymakers

1111
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,191
It's a subtle nuance

1112
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,727
Thing sometimes

1113
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:02,335
Different stakeholders within the government can have different roles

1114
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
One that's taking a

1115
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,199
Particularly active interest is the Federal Trade Commission

1116
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,247
Who looks at things like

1117
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,783
Baby monitors

1118
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,063
Stay they are secure

1119
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,599
Actually they're not sick

1120
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,927
And looking at claims versus actual

1121
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,695
Effectiveness

1122
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:21,279
Food and Drug Administration has done a great job to date

1123
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:26,655
Coming up to speed on cyber security and safety issues within medical devices

1124
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:32,031
The Department of Transportation has recently shown some good sign that they're coming on board

1125
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,335
I in January they published

1126
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,127
A roadmap of what their working

1127
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895

This year

1129
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:42,015
And one of those was to work with security researchers you often find flaws

00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:45,855
And you can help be a part of getting those flaws fix

1131
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,391
Strengthen the automotive ecosystem

1132
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,183
