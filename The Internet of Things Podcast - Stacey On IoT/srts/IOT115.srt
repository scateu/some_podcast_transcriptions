00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,744
And some new Services are launching

10
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,328
Where there's more phones with more personal assistants on them

11
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,120
And the internet

12
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:37,888
Things

13
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,704
Man there's a new study out and it says

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,752
Terrible things are headed away

15
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,336
I bought a brand new device will tell you more about that

16
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,360
We also have

17
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,688
A message from a brand new sponsor TE Connectivity

18
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,248
You're going to learn a lot about connected appliances

19
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,040
And this week's guess

20
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,576
Are actually three people

21
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:01,184
We got Scott Harkins from Honeywell Adam justice of connectsense and nuala O'Connor

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
The center for democracy

23
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,280
Technology all talking about different facets

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
So

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,656
It's going to be a Napoli show

26
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
But it's going to be awesome

27
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,544
Let's Get It Started With the passage from

28
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
This week sponsor is Affiliated monitoring if you are hunting for a subscription Revenue model for your iot business

00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
You need to hear about Affiliated monitoring in response to trigger any connected device Affiliated professionally

Affiliated work with hundreds of smart home security health in other iot businesses visit a Philly

Turn an idea into a thriving business

34
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,736
With a 100 million dollar exit that's Affiliated. Com

35
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
/ iot

36
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,112
Alright Kevin

37
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
A is for apple

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,304
Let's do that in Sister Talking Letters we can throw in WWDC because the worldwide developer conference is going on this

39
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,120
With apple and Michelle Obama

40
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,168
Yes yeah

41
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
Yes

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
The most

43
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,824
Obviously there lots of

44
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,176
Software news for developers which is good cuz it's a developer event

45
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
They were Hardware refreshes on the

46
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
Competing side

47
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,088
And then there was a new product and I think a lot of people

48
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
Don't quite get it

49
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
But that's just me

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
What is a name

51
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
So it is a

52
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,864
Smart connected wi-fi speaker called

53
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Homepod

54
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
What do you think of homepod

55
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
Anthony

56
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,544
Show me the name

57
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
Don't love it

58
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
What were they going to do I Spy

59
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Speaker kit

60
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,064
Is it those are kind of software kits so

61
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
Yeah yeah

62
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
Just

63
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
They didn't call it the Siri

64
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
And I think

65
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
We might get into wide

66
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
Why it's not called

67
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
So

68
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
So what do you think

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
Beyond the name

70
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,168
So beyond the name just

71
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,984
Quick high-level this is a $349

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
7 in tall

73
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
Cylinder speaker

74
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
With us I think 7

75
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:31,712
Wattpad readers and so on speaker since I don't recall the exact numbers

76
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Speakers

77
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,320
But it's interesting from a speaker standpoint because

78
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
It has

79
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:42,208
Beamforming so it can adjust the sound based on type of music

80
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
Placement of the speaker and so on and so forth

81
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
It's got wifi in it

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
From that standpoint

83
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,472
If the Apple application of currently existing speaker technology to me

84
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,288
And everybody says it sounds good I'll be over there listen to it

85
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,104
Set a timer better than the echo

86
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
And I would expect that

87
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
Couple reasons why because they're selling the $349 speakers sound better than $180

88
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Ecco Aurora

89
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:14,720
$120 Google home it's much heavier than those devices about 2 and 1/2 pound so

90
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:20,607
Speakers and power have a lot to do with the weight in the magnets and so on so forth so I would expect that

91
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,679
Everybody kind of shied away from the fact

92
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,751
That it has or will work with Siri

93
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,591
And I think that's because of Apple marketing and the reason I say that is

94
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
Siri is not

95
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Still

96
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
Great

97
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
By comparison in my opinion

98
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,759
They're working on it and they talked about that on stage of

99
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,807
What technologies are using to improve Siri

100
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
But it's not ready yet

101
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,879
In fact the demo speakers

102
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
Siri wasn't even working at Aulani

103
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,791
Everybody is focusing on the speaker the music and so on

104
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
But here's the thing

105
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
Don't neglect that this has

106
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,935
Apple A8 chip inside of it

107
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,239
This will also act as a

108
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,543
Gateway for your homekit devices

109
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,127
That lets you remotely access them away from home

110
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
So to me

111
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
Apple

112
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,759
Get the big win here from marketing standpoint

113
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
Great sounding train $50 speaker

114
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
Come September October iPhone event

115
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,719
And they tell you now in my opinion that Siri is much better here's how

116
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
Now of a sudden

117
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,095
Everybody's like it's coming in December that speaker for 349 sounds so great

118
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,167
It's got Siri smart and works really well as an acid

119
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,471
That's what I think the play is here

120
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,799
People talking about that sound

121
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,687
Yes I think you're right and I think there's a lot that Apple does need to do on the series

122
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,527
And we'll talk about this with our guests because there's also

123
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,111
A really interesting element they talk about with homekit

124
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
I'll just ease that there for you too

125
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
Means that maybe we'll see more homekit

126
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
Get devices in the future

127
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
Certification

128
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
And

129
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
They also emphasize the

130
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Privacy

131
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
That's worth talking

132
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
Because

133
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
Nobody else talks about it this way

134
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,615
Apple is basically saying that

135
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,431
They were not going to send anything

136
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
To their server

137
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
Until

138
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,319
So all that's on device processing

139
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
Send it

140
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,903
They're going to send it out

141
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Encrypted

142
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,975
And they're going to anonymizer

143
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Cancerverse

144
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,535
Rich right now

145
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:31,167
That's their differentiation Point that's how they're trying to stand out for these other devices and services

146
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
Saying hey even we don't know

147
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:39,871
Yesterday that is on our server but it's a non- we can tie back to you and we're not selling that data or

148
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,455
Or matching up with advertisers so you got total privacy

149
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,271
So what I think is interesting is will have apple selling

150
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
Privacy

151
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Shell

152
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
It sounds like

153
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,415
Google home be selling

154
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,535
Actual smart responses to things

155
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
Ecosystem

156
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
We got

157
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,655
Amazon selling its developer ecosystems

158
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,447
You can control just about it

159
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
Skills

160
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,263
I don't know what Microsoft

161
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
We'll see

162
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
I'm sure they can do something

163
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
Alright so

164
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
What are they saying from the news

165
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,247
I thought that Apple adding support for speakers

166
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
Did you notice that

167
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
As what are they

168
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
Yeah they are

169
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,815
I thought that was really cool though I didn't see Sonos in there

170
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,679
And so I don't know what Sonos is like all in on cuz Soto said Apple used to be Thai

171
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
Yeah

172
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
Now

173
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,847
Actually as I was watching the

174
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Keynote

175
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,407
Streaming from work

176
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,759
A couple times in my quilt this company's not going to happen I hope that covers I can be happy now

177
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,551
Synonyms for because

178
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,367
AirPlay 2 and the homepod

179
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
It's all supporting multi-room audio and

180
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
I might go a couple things they announce today

181
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,303
I've been core products or product features

182
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
Their party is that people to be like well

183
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Guess I'm not going to

184
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
Buy that now Kannapolis

185
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
Give me the natively

186
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
That is always happening

187
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
Is it is the way of the

188
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
Cupertino

189
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
Just for a little bit

190
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
Because

191
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
Smarter people tend

192
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
I'm not ashamed

193
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,439
All right so right along

194
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,231
Two more smart home

195
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,303
This is a hug but not a voice assistant this is week

196
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,119
Lync is adding

197
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,679
Some services to its platform

198
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,983
And these are free so if you have

199
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
You're going to get to New services

200
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,127
Debility it'll it'll

201
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
When you're not home

202
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,711
So I thought that was pretty sweet

203
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,783
Because yeah

204
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,831
Recycled in any other one

205
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
Moonlight

206
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:04,767
Relate so basically it's funny because I have robots that do this now I don't need to have those robots

207
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Moonlight

208
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,095
Turns your lights on or off at predetermine

209
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
Time such as

210
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,703
Sunrise sunset that's the default actually and then you can

211
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,519
Also adjust Moonlight have the lights go on or off

212
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
Different times as well but

213
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
Yeah so there's my

214
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,639
My robots that turn lights off at night

215
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,223
Mandana. Asking someone when little

216
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
Yes it is just

217
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
A recipe

218
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
Annapolis

219
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,671
The scheduling thing

220
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
I I don't care for that

221
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
It is what it is so on

222
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,119
In Exile so introduce a new

223
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
Kids call wink bright

224
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
Rick lights actually

225
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
Yes that's okay

226
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,799
So for a hundred I think it's $119 you can get yourself a wink

227
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
Hub 2

228
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,943
Included with the packages to Sylvania smart a19 dimmable bulbs

229
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,783
It's kind of an inexpensive easy way to get you started and of course

230
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,855
When you start adding lights it's like a gateway drug and

231
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,695
You have a Gateway cuz you have a hug so you can just keep adding lights on other things

232
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,327
This is pretty like I think this is noteworthy for the Nerds

233
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,143
It's going to

234
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,471
And seeing a lot of action so

235
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,287
There's a couple of efforts on the standards front to

236
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,591
Make sure that things can be prepared

237
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
You're not prepared

238
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,943
Pair to the hub

239
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Yes

240
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,295
So there's a lot happening there because provisioning in

241
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,343
Pairing

242
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Difficult

243
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,463
We have so much technology yet

244
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
This is still hard

245
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
And wait till you have to

246
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
How to reset Alexa

247
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,911
Ctrl-alt-delete

248
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,007
So you're counting to five in the process

249
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,615
Discovering your devices if you have a neck reallocating yourself

250
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,735
But it's all so simple

251
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
So I asked the wink folks

252
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,367
Because I saw this and I was like this is great this will be at these are nice

253
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,439
You know ways to make yourself smarter very easily

254
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,767
And I also asked are you going to offer premium services

255
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
And they told me

256
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,607
Patrick Mahoney a spokesperson

257
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,167
Send me the email that said it is in the pipeline

258
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
But in the near-term they're rolling out free services

259
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
That tie back to home safety

260
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,871
And that's because home safety is number one reason people buy into

261
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Automation

262
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
So

263
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:36,831
44% of Americans who have purchased a connected product did so to keep their home safe according to wink smart Olympics

264
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
I talk to I control about

265
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
Distance like roughly 33%

266
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
We'll see

267
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,863
Boom shakalaka

268
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
All right

269
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
We'll see more of that from

270
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,543
I'm going to say everybody who has a

271
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,359
Product on the market and is trying to maintain

272
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
Basically stick around

273
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
Because

274
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:08,575
What we're going to see next year or so is a lot of companies that have Smart products realize that holy cow

275
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
Afford to maintain

276
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
Their customer base

277
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,719
With the server cost with the security cost all of that adding

278
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Putting out

279
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
Additional service

280
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
Yay

281
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
Kevin

282
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,495
Another phone or back to assistance

283
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,663
Yeah back to assistant-san and I don't want to give too much on the phone cuz I know we don't do that but I'll mention that the newest HTC phone

284
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Mbu 11

285
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Which

286
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,551
Has been available for pre-order for $650

287
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
It's a flagship phone

288
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
It comes with

289
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,183
Google Assistant because it runs Android of course

290
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
But like

291
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
One of the

292
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,047
Recent Huawei phones this also has

293
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
Native built in

294
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
Hace Amazon Echo but you know I'm talking about

295
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
She who shall not be named

296
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,007
She can be your assistant right on this phone as well now

297
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,847
I say native it's coming in an update after the phone launches through Google

298
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,919
The Google Play store within 30 days of launch

299
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
IPhone launch

300
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,759
But you'll be able to use assistant you'll be able to use

301
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
Matinee

302
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:16,415
And of course they also include HTC Sense companion which is

303
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:21,535
Intelligent type of software the HTC is developed which really reminds me of Google now because it

304
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:27,167
Services contextual information so at least two if not three

305
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
Really looks like a big push

306
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
For Amazon yet

307
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
Echo

308
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,335
Integration into phones in a big way this year

309
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,895
Which kind of surprises me because

310
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,711
Just don't see it on a phone when you already have

311
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
Google Assistant but that's just me

312
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,343
Hey because we mentioned

313
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,671
I work for Google

314
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,231
Full-time consultant not on IRT things

315
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
Any opinion is that

316
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
Isaiah

317
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
I always up

318
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,447
But last week we had a huge huge shift

319
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
In the force

320
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,567
The caverns are show which is Kevin weekend

321
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
How do you feel

322
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
I do like it

323
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:13,503
I mean again a lot of the functionality are already had with Google Assistant that's not like I added new functionality

324
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,807
And as I said before one of the things that I

325
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
Kept me from buying it

326
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,391
Cuz my music services that I listen to Arms

327
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
Supporters on it

328
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
But

329
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,511
It's actually really easy to cast audio

330
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Or video

331
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
Watch it from your phone

332
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
To any

333
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:33,727
Cast enabled device which Google home is so I just listened to my Beatles channel on SiriusXM in the app

334
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,031
Cast it to the Google home speaker so

335
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
Yeah it's it's working well it's

336
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,175
Turn lights on

337
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
But that's

338
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,759
Google home specific as Google Assistant

339
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
Specific

340
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
We're getting there

341
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,367
Yes it still doesn't work with locks in

342
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,999
Actually going forward I'm kind of curious about the fate of

343
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,607
Has as a gem or Stephen to assistant anyone with an Android phone is probably like

344
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
I could actually do this with the Android phone

345
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
So

346
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,775
Alright by the way hello

347
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
And you actually carrier

348
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Okay

349
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
So

350
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
Moving right along

351
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,319
We have a big meeting

352
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Port to talk

353
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
I title this at our show notes

354
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,023
Because that's kind of what it felt like

355
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
So what happened is Pew Research Center

356
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,887
Report all about iot

357
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
And basically

358
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:41,055
You can tell from the title they're like The Internet of Things connectivity binge what are the implications

359
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
The implications are

360
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,431
That you will never not be connected

361
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
That's my summation of this

362
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
Entire report witch

363
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
Everyone should read because it is

364
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,111
Excellent and covers a lot of things that we talked about

365
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
On the show

366
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
A lot

367
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
So if you are connected

368
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,231
You can expect

369
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,047
Exploits and attacks is basically what I cut out of

370
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
So

371
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,959
You're going to be connected because your life is going to increasingly demanding

372
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,567
And we're almost there today like you have to be to get a job

373
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,639
Right that's that's just that's why internet connectivity

374
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,431
An argument is

375
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,247
Uber time your devices are going to have to be

376
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,319
Connected in your home because otherwise you're not going to be able to

377
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
Function or do things with

378
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
Feels a little crazy but

379
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
I could see it happening

380
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,279
I could I tell you I just

381
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,583
I feel so sad reading this report I mean

382
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,119
I'm just going to read one sentence

383
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,911
This reminds me of Terminator

384
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,751
What used to be attacks against data and information have become attackers against

385
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,311
Flesh steel and concrete

386
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,383
Which is true I get it, infrastructure and

387
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
And even wearable devices

388
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,247
I get it but wow you don't have to say it

389
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
Well so I actually did a

390
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
In my newsletter last

391
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,623
Play the Shameless plug for my newsletter

392
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
I actually did a

393
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,463
EU report that was amazing

394
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
On

395
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:08,351
Data security so they were talking about iot security not as a privacy issue

396
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
What is a safety issue

397
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:16,799
And they compared it to you once you start and it didn't notice what you start connecting infrastructure

398
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,359
Attacks bear have real impacts on

399
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
People's lives

400
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Actually

401
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
I just

402
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
My data was stolen

403
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:32,671
Report

404
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,463
It's like 7 minutes long

405
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
Summarizes

406
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
Points

407
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,071
They're not wrong we're putting all the stuff out it's

408
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
Highly insecure

409
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887
I will reach you

410
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
My favorites

411
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Because

412
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,751
Also something really well

413
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,799
Resistance is futile

414
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,871
Penalize those who disconnect

415
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
Social processes

416
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
Reward those who

417
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
Fully withdrawing

418
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Maybe

419
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,111
You will plug into the Matrix is what they're saying

420
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
Is there again

421
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:09,023
Not wrong it's going to be harder like especially in things like

422
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,839
Appliances it's going to be harder and harder to not

423
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
Buy things that are connected

424
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
Not just for your benefit

425
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
But for

426
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,471
The appliance maker

427
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,031
So to get warranty service on something

428
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
You're probably going to have to connect

429
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
Because then they can see how things are were

430
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Right

431
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,967
Until once you start doing that

432
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Then they're like

433
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Hey

434
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,063
Here's a service we can offer you why don't you

435
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,367
You're connected washer why don't we offer you

436
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
Euro results

437
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,951
Amazon dash button service

438
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
And so then you're like

439
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
Oh that sounds great

440
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Except

441
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
Then you're locked into

442
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
Buying a certain kind of laundry

443
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,007
And get we talked about this the guardian

444
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
Did a

445
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:58,431
An article on this that they took the report as its theme so it's like you will connect and then really dug in

446
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
2

447
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,503
How we're kind of unquestioningly

448
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:06,111
Allocating more and more of our buying decisions to these products

449
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,951
And how the number of choices presented to us

450
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Are becoming more limited

451
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,791
Think of it is the idea of network neutrality

452
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
In search results on you

453
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
Amazon Echo

454
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
Rate

455
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
So

456
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
Companies pay for shelf space in

457
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
In the grocery store

458
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,031
Eventually they might start paying

459
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
4

460
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
You don't first listing in

461
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
Your Amazon Echo

462
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,503
In the question here is Will consumers be aware of

463
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
Will it recognize that that's happened

464
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
And that's

465
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Probably a no

466
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,671
Yeah I miss animal not not unless

467
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
Their major

468
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,767
Media stories about it explain how this works

469
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,911
You listening to the show

470
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Paired

471
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Soho

472
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,519
I think that the good outweighs the

473
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
The bad

474
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
Thanks

475
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
Baidu

476
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,663
Debbie lack of transparency here

477
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,943
Is going to

478
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,271
Both cause a loss of trust that makes people

479
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
Not buying

480
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,343
To this which is fine but

481
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
Sad because

482
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
More data

483
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
Market insights

484
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
For everyone

485
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,303
And I also think that companies need to be

486
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,375
Aware of the influence they pedal

487
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,191
And help build trust with consumers that they're not

488
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
Abusing that

489
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,311
So that's beyond transparency that might be things like letting you set your

490
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,103
You don't make it very easy to

491
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
Cast something to her

492
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,663
Send something to a screen so you can

493
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
You can choose you

494
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,735
What you're buying

495
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
If the price changes there

496
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
Very obvious like

497
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
Hey by the way

498
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,159
Usually that cost 699 but today for some reason

499
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,231
There's a storm in Malaysia it's up to 788

500
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
These kind of things should

501
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
Be a pair

502
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
The grid

503
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
None of this is controversy

504
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:00,287
And I don't know should you be able to buy this is going to be interesting should you be able to

505
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Disconnect

506
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:07,711
The products and I asked is because you know there's things like predictive maintenance but there's also things like really interesting Energy savings

507
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
Benefit societies

508
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,599
Yeah I mean I prefer connected products over non-cancer products

509
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
When it makes sense

510
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,000
But I don't think it should be either or binary choice I think people should have it

511
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
And we're not there

512
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
This report for

513
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,864
Computer really makes it sound like

514
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
It's inevitable

515
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
Resistance is futile

516
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,008
But I actually think you can

517
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
What's your dollars

518
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
And that could

519
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
Is

520
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:44,576
How people react to things like the homepod Apple is reselling privacy

521
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
Keep that in mind

522
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
Go read the report

523
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
It was scared

524
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
Ed

525
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
You mentioned homepod wood

526
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,192
Which has to do with music and I think you just bought something

527
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Music

528
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,408
And it just says no reply

529
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
Apart

530
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Alright Jack

531
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,064
I did I bought

532
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,880
Okay longtime listeners of the show will be

533
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,976
Be rewarded with a shot of dopamine cuz you're going to remember that I talked about this

534
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512
80 months ago

535
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
This is the mighty

536
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
MP

537
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,656
Somebody MP3 player

538
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
This is a

539
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:39,104
Spotify is a dedicated Spotify player

540
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,664
Oh and iPod Nano

541
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
Sorry to shuffle

542
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,832
It hasn't been updated in years but it's

543
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,856
Hey

544
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
Cuz it doesn't work with Spotify

545
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,256
Does even work with apple music so you have to put your own MP3

546
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,608
Alright nevermind

547
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,632
2012

548
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,472
Alright so what we have is the mighty

549
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,264
This is a

550
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
Tiny little

551
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,824
Device

552
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,872
BICYCLE stores your Spotify stuff

553
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,408
Offline

554
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
So I can take this

555
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,784
When I walk the dog or go running at stores a thousand songs

556
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
What's 5 hours

557
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,136
35 hours

558
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
And

559
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,744
I saw this on Kickstarter

560
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
Again

561
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
Like

562
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,840
18 months ago and I was

563
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
Super excited

564
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,728
I didn't buy it cuz I was like

565
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
I still burnout on my

566
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Kickstarter's

567
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,336
In the pebble

568
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
Announced

569
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
Was that what it was

570
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
Pebble

571
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,296
Announced a very similar product in since I had a pebble

572
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
Can I trust a pebble

573
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,904
I was like I'll get my money down for that

574
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
And then

575
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Fitbit

576
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
What pedal

577
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,560
And I was very bad

578
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
No court for you

579
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
No car for me

580
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:10,240
So I went back to my baby and I was like are they going to make it and just

581
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032
Or last week

582
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,336
They announced that they were Spotify certified

583
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
And

584
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,152
Product will ship June

585
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
XXX

586
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
So I

587
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
I put down

588
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
$85

589
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
It turns out with shipping

590
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
$95 or

591
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,856
$94

592
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,648
In about an orange mighty

593
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
Tennessee

594
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,488
In July you guys

595
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
The test is puppy out

596
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,560
It will see if it answers

597
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
All of my prayer

598
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,656
Or at least the ones I had about listening

599
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,496
Can we just talk about the Spotify certified thing

600
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
Yes

601
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:47,360
So also regular listeners will remember I said

602
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:52,480
That music services are now becoming a part of the lock-in for wearable devices

603
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,760
Because you want

604
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,576
Add Apple watch to exercise which I sometimes do

605
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,136
I can only get music from

606
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
My Apple music

607
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Service

608
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Onto that

609
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,024
I want to

610
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,864
Using Android play

611
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
I got all that but you know

612
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,448
These things are tied to services

613
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,008
So this is the first that I know of

614
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,544
First device that allows

615
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,592
Spotify offline playback

616
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,152
My Samsung wearable has

617
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,688
Spotify Spotify app

618
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
But all it is is a controller

619
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,504
For Spotify my phone so

620
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
Doesn't store the Spotify

621
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
Music

622
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,904
Spotify certification is interesting to me makes me wonder if other

623
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
Wearable

624
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,976
Device makers will be

625
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,792
Getting Spotify certified in the future

626
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
We should clarify this is be first

627
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,864
Wearable

628
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
Device

629
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,424
But you have Spotify

630
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
His

631
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,032
Sure sure sure absolutely yeah

632
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,336
Correct

633
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
It's too early to say I'm curious to see

634
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,968
If any other devices get certified for Spotify now

635
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,808
Or not again I'm just concerned but I want more choices

636
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,088
I'm a music selection

637
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,392
For my whereabouts when I go running listen music

638
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,952
Can I listen to music that's tied to the

639
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
Device itself

640
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,816
And that's one of the nice things that both Amazon and

641
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Have done and

642
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
I'm curious if

643
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
Which is

644
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
A pic from

645
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
Music service

646
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,056
And you can eat them

647
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,384
Yeah

648
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,480
Doesn't really give you that many choices I'm missing it

649
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,504
I didn't give you that money

650
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,808
But they do get on Google choices

651
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,600
Noah Spotify is set as my

652
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,672
Really

653
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Really

654
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,000
Maybe because I know the Spotify app

655
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
It's not picking up on that

656
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,864
To say there's a link that you can add their

657
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,216
Certified this you go into your device settings

658
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,032
In the Google Assistant settings there's a section called music

659
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Music

660
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,360
Your choices are Google Play Music

661
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
YouTube music

662
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
New default provider which is account

663
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Preferences on share

664
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
Pandora

665
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
So they recently they have

666
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
Fanatics but that's good

667
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,488
That's getting your vehicle has

668
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,048
Had many many services for quite some time

669
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
That's good

670
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,376
That actually raises the question as you said

671
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,656
Will Apple allow

672
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,704
Non Apple Music Services on

673
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,728
Don Potter

674
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
And there was no mention of that

675
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
At WWDC

676
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
My money says no

677
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,152
But after a word from our sponsor

678
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
Can expect

679
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:33,248
Text you this week's guess we've got Scott Harkins of Honeywell

680
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,880
Connectsense and O'Connor for the center for democracy and Technology

681
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,976
Stay tuned for much more

682
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:49,376
Everyone it's time for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is TE Connectivity

683
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,192
I have Nick Langston from TE Connectivity here

684
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,496
To talk to us about what the company does

685
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,312
What I want the audience to understand is that

686
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
And you look at all of these

687
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,920
Interesting pieces of Hardware that are appearing

688
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,968
In our kitchens and in our home

689
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,992
Every one of these

690
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
Full of different

691
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,576
Pieces of Hardware that allows

692
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,416
Sensing or data or power

693
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
Moving around

694
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,976
Between these devices

695
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,280
Does little connectors that allow that to happen

696
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:21,376
TV connectivity is in the business of Designing the sensors and connectors

697
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,168
Possible

698
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,216
Can you give us some examples of

699
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
What you're talkin

700
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,312
For the example that most of us

701
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,128
It is something like a USB connector

702
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
Those

703
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
Plugs

704
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,480
Are the types of connectors

705
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,504
That allow the tree

706
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,088
Data and power to and from certain devices

707
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,648
There's a huge variety

708
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,672
Of connector

709
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,720
Inside your average laptop

710
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
Let alone

711
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,792
Your average refrigerator

712
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
Dishwasher

713
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Car washing

714
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,912
And then you also introduce sensing

715
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,728
What temperatures are we going to have to measure

716
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,776
Do we need to measure vibration

717
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,592
Need to measure humidity how do we combine

718
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,616
Dos War

719
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:07,968
Works of features and capabilities in the smallest possible package

720
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
That's what we're in the biz

721
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:15,392
What are some of the Innovative things that we can expect coming forward especially when it comes to things like the smart

722
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,208
Smart kitchen is an exciting place

723
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
It really does

724
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:23,072
Seem to be the focal point of the connected home

725
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,864
We all know how much time we spend in

726
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,888
Kitchen now

727
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,496
And what we're seeing is a trend where people are adding precision

728
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,544
To all of the devices

729
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,408
If you see products like smart ovens

730
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,456
Read a new types of device

731
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,504
Like sous vide circulator

732
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,064
All of these are using increased

733
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,648
In measuring data whether it's

734
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,952
Temperature or humidity or

735
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,792
Weight of food or evaporation of material from

736
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
It's

737
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,400
Really about increasing Precision so that we can make

738
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,936
Fooda prepare things

739
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
What consists of

740
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
That seems to be what

741
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
Ace Hardware Aspen

742
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,592
Check that the Internet of Things is really a neighbor

743
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Is that

744
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,176
Everyone can become an ex

745
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:15,296
Through the use of high-resolution sensors and to some extent artificial intelligence

746
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Well

747
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,344
Precision is important

748
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,648
Reliability is also

749
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
A big challenge

750
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
How do you guys think

751
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,280
We're in the business of making sure

752
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,096
The sensors are ready to survive

753
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,632
Extremely high temperature

754
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,192
Or the wet environment

755
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,496
The inside of a dishwasher or washing

756
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,824
Or that you'll be able to control the efficiency

757
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
Nothing like your refrigerator

758
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:43,712
Which consumes a huge percentage of the electricity in the average household

759
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,248
Nick that sounds awesome

760
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,296
Where can people go to find out more

761
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:51,136
We invite you to visit our website you can CSS

762
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,720
Ged.com connected home

763
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,144
Alright the big news this week

764
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,704
Was the Apple homepod

765
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,800
Which actually isn't coming out this week it will be out in December

766
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
We can't just let this

767
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
Slibuy

768
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,920
We're going to have a couple experts this week

769
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
To talk to us

770
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,248
What's a homepod

771
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
For the smart

772
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,880
First up we have Scott Harkins who is AVP

773
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Connected home

774
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,208
Hi Scott how are you doing

775
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
Doing great baby how are you

776
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,280
Loving life

777
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
So

778
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,608
I don't know if you saw it yesterday but

779
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,144
Apple introduced

780
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
The home

781
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
And since you guys

782
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,800
With apple producing a homekit certified thermostat

783
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,640
I thought you'd be a good person to talk to you about what this might mean

784
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
I did

785
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:52,064
See I watched it live like I do every WWDC I was pretty excited

786
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,856
About it I think

787
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
It looks like a great

788
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:59,488
Product great looking product that the reviews I've read seem to make it sound like it

789
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,048
Some great sound quality to it

790
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,328
And

791
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,120
The fact that a polite

792
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,912
Think with a piece of Hardware efficiency

793
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
Turn yourself into space is a

794
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,264
Is a really big deal and you and I have talked

795
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
The four about

796
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,336
Like the impact of just voice control

797
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
Of the home and so

798
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,200
Let's tell other people like what voice control the home has meant

799
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
For you guys what have you seen

800
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
Produces these products

801
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:27,904
Stacy we introduced a voice-controlled Connect

802
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,304
Is thermostat a few years ago to pretty rave reviews we immediately saw and recognized it that boys like havoc

803
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
Play in the consumer Market

804
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,912
You know that the Amazon Echo came along with its voice

805
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
System

806
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,240
And I think really revolutionized

807
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
The space

808
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,312
What ID for Honeywell

809
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,616
Specifically or at least for some of our perspectives

810
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
In the market

811
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,200
It proved to things that prove that

812
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,480
Consumers actually

813
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:56,320
You can get it and understand voice and can understand different things and

814
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,392
Semantics that they have to say to make something work

815
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,208
But more importantly in the connected home world

816
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,792
It proved one of our key perspectives which was

817
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,352
Consumers actually want one kind of user

818
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,120
Experiencing

819
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,728
Much of the industry for many years was talking about Halo on one app

820
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
Emby amazon echo

821
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,384
Stepped in and probably by Design. I guess we're not sure

822
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,456
Did it with voice we're going to beat the Spire products

823
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,736
Please different protocols

824
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
Communication techniques

825
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,576
Can I be controlled by talking to

826
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,856
Speaker

827
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,392
And I think that's a

828
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,464
Really big deal as an example of

829
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,584
How Amazon Echo has really become one of the key drivers in the market

830
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
Place

831
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,912
We can look at 1 24-hour.

832
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,960
Midnight from Christmas Eve

833
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,008
Could midnight Christmas Day

834
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,824
More than 10000 consumers connect

835
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,616
Amazon Echo

836
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,920
Two-way Honeywell thermostat

837
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,968
In one 24-hour period

838
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
So

839
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,296
Since this isn't actually due until December

840
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,832
Which many months away

841
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
Looking at what you know now

842
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,440
And the experience that you guys have had

843
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
What would you suggest

844
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,792
They could do to make your life

845
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
Consumers

846
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
I'm not so bold as to

847
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,168
She just asked what they ought to do but

848
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:20,288
I do think some promotion in the meantime it's get word out there about Apple and Hope

849
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,360
Getting this product would be beneficial when it comes to the market

850
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,688
Selfishly speaking in the greater connected-home world

851
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:30,016
The more they all do to promote this face in their product in the

852
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,552
Connected home aspects to it

853
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,832
The batter off

854
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,392
Awesome

855
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,952
What is your take on homekit today

856
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,488
Like our consumers

857
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,024
Really interested in home

858
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,096
Another really good question Stacey I think that most

859
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,144
Consumers probably dozen

860
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,448
Really know what home kit is yet

861
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
Unless

862
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
They're setting up

863
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
Pay Home Depot

864
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,128
So if you were setting up one Honeywell

865
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,664
T5 thermostat

866
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,456
And you had an iOS device

867
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:03,552
Missing you were setting up it would recognize iOS and it was prompt you to set it up

868
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,136
That in some cases might be their first real

869
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
Exposure

870
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:12,000
Right and at that point you know we actually see the fair amount of customer say yes

871
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,304
50% but

872
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,120
I offer my customers that have iOS devices

873
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,424
To say yes and then go down the route setting

874
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,216
Clean up as a homekit enabled

875
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,264
I'm not

876
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
Senior as a kid

877
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,336
Nazi

878
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
Investment in advertising

879
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,456
Into the General market riding not seen anything about

880
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,760
Unless it's driven by

881
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,040
The device comes

882
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,160
But it isn't

883
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,744
With your Apple user iOS user every

884
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,048
Device that you set up in that setup

885
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:49,376
Process it will recognize whether you're on an Apple device or not

886
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,168
Impromptu you enroll it in home

887
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,984
Which is a really interesting way to get

888
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
Connectivity in the marketplace

889
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,336
And I think also makes that home

890
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,920
Pod when it gets dropped in right it's going to drop into an existing

891
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,712
Ecosystem

892
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
Devices in the home

893
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
I'm excited

894
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
The homepod actually works like

895
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
The other Apple experience

896
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,416
I can imagine just bringing that into your house

897
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,232
Having it recognize everything and you don't even have to do this

898
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,512
Space discovery

899
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
Weird

900
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,328
Tying things together that happens in

901
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
That could be

902
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,400
Because people will be like

903
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,472
Holy cow all the sudden I can control my thermostat with my voice

904
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
Wow

905
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,312
Yeah

906
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,616
The privacy pop

907
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,920
I swear it's not listening until you wake it up

908
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,480
Which is very different than how both Amazon

909
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
And Google went to Market and

910
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,808
And goes to

911
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,344
Kind of their commitment to private

912
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
Part of their rights

913
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Key Market

914
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
Strategy

915
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,976
Tell the quality sound I can't wait

916
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,256
Hear it I have

917
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,048
Sonos in my home and I love it

918
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,864
I would hope that it's at least not good

919
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
If not better

920
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,448
And in the fact that it unlocks that were

921
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:01,824
Remote connectivity really for the first time in a way that doesn't require right Apple

922
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,128
TV's not that there's anything wrong with that

923
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
But it's

924
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,712
I think the speaker approaches to

925
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
Just eat better

926
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,040
Go easier price for the consumer to get their head around

927
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,600
I'm with you all right big Scott

928
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:20,768
Next guest is Adam Justice who is the founder of the connectsense brand which is a lie

929
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:25,888
Sensors connected outlets and other good stuff that ties into

930
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,936
Homekit and other ecosystem

931
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
Guess Adam

932
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:35,616
Yeah some of the other ecosystems stuff is still still coming but yeah we were very early player in the homekit space

933
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,968
So what did you think about the Apple homepod

934
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,016
Just basically some of the Apple news

935
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:42,784
Yesterday

936
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,368
Always good to see homekit mention on stage and

937
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,256
Looks like some new device profiles and things like that coming to homekit so

938
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
That was

939
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
Interesting

940
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
And then home pod

941
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
Definitely

942
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,680
Apple's entry into the smart

943
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,776
Home assistant Market to compete with Amazon Echo

944
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,848
And the Google home and I felt like

945
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,664
Before the show if they were going to do something here

946
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,456
I hope they would differentiate it

947
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
In some ways and

948
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,272
Differentiation

949
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,344
It's the really lean in on a music and sound quality

950
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,928
So to me and almost felt like there more going after Sonos then

951
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,208
Then really some of that

952
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,304
Smart speaker alternative sent and really playing up the music I think that's

953
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,192
Time Warner places where they felt they were strongest and so they were going to lean in on that they also think there's a lot

954
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,240
We don't know about these devices

955
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:38,336
So far so I had a chance to see it in the Hands-On area yesterday

956
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,360
It looks nice

957
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,920
I wasn't functional we couldn't hear it

958
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
You can touch it but

959
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
It looks nice

960
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,040
Doesn't have a screen on it

961
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:51,392
I have a similar white aesthetic to like what's going on with the Google home

962
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:56,512
And yes Mother good things it's got Hub capabilities for homekit so it runs on the same

963
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,792
AA chip

964
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:04,448
That's what's in the current Apple TV generation was probably why they use that so it'll be another Hub in the house and further

965
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
Extending

966
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,496
Homekit devices

967
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,776
Which I think is a good thing

968
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,824
What would you like to see

969
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:15,968
Between now and December what would you hope to hear from Apple as a company that builds home Kik

970
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
Yeah I think that's a big

971
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:22,880
Point to its we got seven months to go before this thing ships

972
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
So

973
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,464
I felt like they were maybe two reasons why they

974
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
They showed

975
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
What they have

976
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
Today

977
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,888
And what they showed yesterday and one maybe that maybe they have some

978
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,936
Really cool features on this

979
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,984
And they just didn't want to tip their hats

980
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,104
To the competition and show off something and give them 7 months to catch up

981
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
The other one was

982
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:49,760
They got seven months of software development still to do on this until

983
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:54,368
You know that's a lot of time and I'm sure they are putting their best and brightest on this

984
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,136
And so

985
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,464
You know what we see in December definitely is going to be greater than

986
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,744
What they talked about on the

987
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,328
Stage hear about yet

988
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,632
I would say my biggest one is

989
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,448
A way to handle multi users

990
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,264
I think Google home does this a little bit

991
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,664
And kind of the basics beginnings of that but in the Apple ecosystem individual user accounts

992
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,968
It's so important for everything you're going to do

993
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,040
And the fact that it had messaging capabilities listed

994
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,368
Made me feel like maybe this is a thing that they're going to have

995
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,488
I think for this to be a really great communal device it needs to be a have a way to differentiate

996
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
I'm with you on that

997
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
Okay

998
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
Anything else

999
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:40,704
The other one that I'm not quite sure on yet is

1000
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,288
The other thing they talked about in the homekit slide yesterday was

1001
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
The

1002
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
Homekit profile

1003
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,896
And so

1004
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,176
That feels like there

1005
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,992
Could be some cool things we could do with speakers

1006
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,832
We have a water sensor for example that'll be on the market later this year

1007
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,368
And it would be great if

1008
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,720
The result of a water sensor could be something coming through a speaker of

1009
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,256
Hey there's water in your basement

1010
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,048
You should go do something about that

1011
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,120
It does in the Press materials after the

1012
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,424
Big WWDC Keynote

1013
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,448
Apple Help

1014
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Put in

1015
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
A little

1016
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,544
Felt like a throwaway line that talked about

1017
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,128
Making it easier for developers and makers of smart home devices

1018
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,944
To connect into the ecosystem using software

1019
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
And that

1020
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,272
Struck me as import

1021
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
What about you

1022
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:34,208
I was surprised this wasn't mentioned earlier and I think we'll find out more later this week but that's certainly interesting

1023
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,000
Change of tune a little bit

1024
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
It said you know

1025
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,352
New ways to authenticate devices using software

1026
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:45,728
And then even in the session description there was something about some support for hobbyists and Things 2

1027
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,264
To be able to play so

1028
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,056
CI as of today

1029
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:55,455
You know you need to have a apple authentication chips as part of your design and so that's been challenging

1030
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,759
For some companies who have devices already out

1031
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,831
Maybe why some people have not adopted Home Care

1032
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,367
You know I think

1033
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,695
Certainly interesting and we'll see you when we learn a little bit more but

1034
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,231
You know could certainly changed

1035
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
Gay men

1036
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
Certainly

1037
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,559
To me feels like

1038
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:17,215
This ecosystem is important to them and they want to remove some barriers to help as many manufacturers adopted

1039
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,775
All right I am excited

1040
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
Thanks

1041
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:26,175
Connect to talk about privacy and the implications of having an always-on

1042
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
Listening device in your home

1043
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,247
You're still O'Connor

1044
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,063
From the center for democracy and Technology

1045
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,367
So I'm curious

1046
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,415
About Canada privacy application

1047
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,207
In general for these types of the

1048
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,767
Well I'm glad for saw that

1049
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
Apple is

1050
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,863
Concerned about and is continuing their strong history of

1051
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,911
Thinking about data collection of

1052
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:52,799
All of its devices and I think I reapplied them for a the strong stance they took obviously in

1053
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,103
Protecting data encryption on the iPhone

1054
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
I think

1055
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:59,199
I've looked a little bit of the echo I've looked less at the Google products

1056
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:04,319
All of the companies are thinking about in are aware of the fact that you are entering into someone's

1057
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Home

1058
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:11,487
And I think the boundaries in the protections for privacy should be even higher than they are obviously on the street

1059
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
Sayonara

1060
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,839
Kitchen laws United States there's a Public Square in a private Zone

1061
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:22,239
These devices blur the line between what is truly private and what becomes somewhat Republic

1062
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:26,847
Carlie shared with private sector companies so suddenly all of our most kind of intimate

1063
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,639
Details of our daily lives

1064
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,431
Are mediated or shared

1065
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
Through

1066
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:37,087
Companies on their way to the recipient of the phone call or of the email or the text excetera excetera

1067
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:43,487
And because of that I think we're really calling a company sit to take a stronger and stronger stance as they are further info

1068
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,303
Further inside the cartilage inside the boundary of the home

1069
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,655
And I think you know what I'm glad to see companies competing on privacy at the value

1070
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,983
From a person who cares about privacy and things pretty deeply about it

1071
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,263
What we know so far about

1072
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
The homepod

1073
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,311
Is that

1074
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,615
Until you say the phrase hey Siri

1075
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,407
Nothing is being sent

1076
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,199
Apple and then when it sent

1077
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,247
They're doing an optimization

1078
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,271
An encryption app

1079
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,551
The data so

1080
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,623
The company actually isn't able to view your data on its server

1081
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,391
First title

1082
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,255
And that feels pretty different from how both Google and Amazon see the tree

1083
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
Is that something we should expect

1084
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:25,727
I think those are all terrific projections and I think they really nailed it on the issue of what is

1085
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
Collected and when

1086
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:31,103
And then how long it's stored and in what way again I am not

1087
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,127
Strong confident

1088
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,199
The comment on the differences of the variations between the three

1089
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:39,295
7 major Home Products right now but those are all really compelling

1090
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,367
Things to think about it's look for as a consumer

1091
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:46,207
What information is being collected when does it say device

1092
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,487
Start collecting it

1093
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,023
How long has it been

1094
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,815
Stored and in what way

1095
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:57,215
Encrypting it and Kennedy identifying it as if our things that we here at CDT have long pushed

1096
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,495
For in Fallout 4

1097
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:04,127
And those are the kinds of protections the fact that the company simply can't see it or can't read it or can't interpret

1098
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,431
What it is you're saying and doing online

1099
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:12,831
That's some of the highest level projections again that's why we need a we was really think Apple's the very strong and other companies as well on encryption

1100
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,671
And that's really what's going to be necessary to protect

1101
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:21,023
But only some kind of law enforcement requests in National Security requests but

1102
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,815
But from hackers in from Attack

1103
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:27,423
As we become more and more reliant on these devices and our daily lives

1104
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,959
What seems like

1105
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,751
Credit mundane data

1106
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:37,151
Can be actually created you don't put together in a way that can create a very both nefarious or very innocent picture of

1107
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:37,919
Your daily life

1108
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
The same fact

1109
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:44,575
Different ways you could be used for against you in a court of law or Court of public opinion excetera

1110
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:50,975
Example I use there was a case in the midwest involving a whole bunch of Home Products even something as mundane as a smart water

1111
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,999
Water meter

1112
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:56,095
And there was a murder in the home some of you may have heard of the story of nothing with an arc

1113
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,375
And

1114
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,423
That's a huge amount of water with

1115
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,215
Used in that home on.

1116
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:07,615
Night in question what are some visitors to the home ended up dead at the end of the night I'm very tragic circumstances

1117
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:12,223
But the same detail the fact that a huge amount of water was suddenly use could

1118
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,247
Interpreted as

1119
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:19,903
They were stealing the hot tub because they were having a party or they were washing away the blood right and you can see lawyers in Atlanta

1120
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,671
Court of law

1121
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
Arguing both of those

1122
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:29,375
And so not having the state available not having it online not having it in a human readable format

1123
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,423
Is very very strong protection

1124
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,959
Awesome so then

1125
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:39,359
How do we educate consumers about this like the fact that Apple seems to be talking more about encryption I

1126
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:44,479
Pink is awesome except I don't know how many consumers really understand the technology

1127
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,271
How do we help them

1128
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,623
That is such a great point and I'm constantly saying to that the folks I work with

1129
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:54,207
When we are talking about are very nerdy kind of wonky

1130
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,255
Concerned about VPN

1131
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
Door

1132
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,327
How encryption works or what kind of

1133
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,399
Cyber security protections exist around your devices

1134
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:09,055
We need to make this understandable to people who shouldn't be forced to understand the inner workings of every device they own in order to you

1135
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:13,151
I think was Walt Mossberg and into his last call and recently said

1136
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:17,503
If we don't expect people to understand the combustion engine in order to drive a car

1137
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:23,391
They shouldn't be forced to understand me to take you have a PhD in computer science in order to own a phone or a laptop

1138
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,439
And I think and I said

1139
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,511
Ben Franklin out for decades to come because I've worked for and Weston

1140
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
Against

1141
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:35,679
The onus is on the company developing and introducing new technologies to be an educator

1142
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,215
To be an explainer

1143
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:43,615
And I did not an a scan of spend more than not only 1/8 we think our product is great but she obviously expects but this is

1144
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,919
How the product works and impractical

1145
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:52,575
Simple terms for every user every consumer to understand and to make educated choices I think we've probably

1146
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:58,975
I need to get to the point where the same words mean the same things and consumers can make educated decisions

1147
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,999
Clean different devices

1148
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,791
Based on real

1149
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,095
Understandable differences and I think

1150
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:09,215
Some of that is explaining privacy policies that some of it is actually in how the devices work I know

1151
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,287
I must have been out for several more years

1152
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:15,103
And it lights up when you talk to it it circles one way when it

1153
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,175
It's doing one thing at Circle to the light circle another way when it does another thing

1154
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,199
These are kind of

1155
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:21,759
Inherent or kind of in the environment

1156
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:28,415
Disclosures with I would be a big fan of not making someone go to the privacy policy on the website to understand

1157
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,207
A device that is sitting on their kitchen counter

1158
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
They also saying

1159
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:35,839
More information should be available to the users who want to dive deeper

1160
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:42,239
Into the inner workings of the device so it's contracts on layered notice where there's a short notice after device whether it's

1161
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,543
Lighting up or it's flashing or sexy

1162
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:48,383
Speaking to you which would make sense for the device that speaks that you speak to

1163
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,919
It should speak back and say

1164
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:54,271
This is with who I am and this is what I'm doing in this is kind of what this happening with your data

1165
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:59,647
But then you can go to the website there or elsewhere and find more information and again in it and easy

1166
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,183
Digestible format

1167
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,999
Okay so my next feature request is going to be

1168
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,047
You know having the Amazon Echo

1169
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,351
Just tell me it's privacy and security practice

1170
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,375
This is when I ask it

1171
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,911
That's okay

1172
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:14,239
No thank you so much for coming on the show

1173
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,543
Thank you so much for having a satellite

1174
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:23,455
That's it for this week's show thank you so much for listening and if you want more

1175
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:29,855
Iot news you can sign up for my newsletter Stacy at Stacey on iot

1176
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,879
Dot-com

1177
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,415
Will see you next week
