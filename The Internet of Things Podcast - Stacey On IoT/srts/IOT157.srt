00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,296
Security principles

6
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,856
Much Ado over privacy

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,440
Related to Facebook and possibly as Hardware plans

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,768
We're also going to test out something new with the Google Assistant

9
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,304
We got some news bits about

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,864
Companies buying other companies in the space

11
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,168
And Kevin is going to share his experience with the

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,192
Fibaro plug

13
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,496
We'll share some news about Philips Hue Lights

14
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,056
Details on August

15
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:45,824
Latest up

16
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,128
So

17
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,200
+ Dr Leslie Saxon who's going to talk about the

18
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
The future of

19
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
Healthcare

20
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:58,880
As our guest this week and we're going to have Samsung talking about arctic for the industrial

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,672
But first

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,952
Let's hear from you

23
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,024
This week sponsor is ring

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,584
Rings mission is to make neighborhood safer

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,448
Stay over a million people use the amazing ring video doorbell to help protect their

26
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:17,056
Bring those that security begins at the front door but it doesn't end there

27
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
So they're extending that same level of security to the rest of your home with the ring floodlight cam just like Rings doorbell

28
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
Floodlight cam is a motion-activated camera and floodlight that connects right to your phone with HD video into

29
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,696
Two-way audio that lets you know the moment anyone steps on your property

30
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
You can see and speak to visitors even set up an alarm right from your phone so when ring floodlight cam when things

31
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
You'll immediately know what it is

32
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
Ring floodlight offers the ultimate in home security with high-visibility floodlights and a powerful HD

33
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
Camera that puts Security in your hands so with ring you're always home you guys can save up to a

34
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,272
$150 off a ring of security kit

35
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,416
When you go to ring.com Stacy that's ring.com

00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,000
Stacy check it out and help support our show

37
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,048
Okay Kevin

38
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
Probably

39
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,144
Men that feel like there's two big stories this week there's like

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
The continuing

41
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,472
Privacy debacle is everyone's like holy cow

42
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
These companies are collecting your data

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
And then on the iot side

44
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
Weave

45
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
Combine Belkin witch

46
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,920
I know that when you saw that you sent me

47
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
And emailed it so eloquent

48
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,992
I said whoa

49
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
But all I can think of at the time now

50
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,624
I thought that too that was my splits I was like

51
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
Actually I think was more like

52
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
So

53
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:42,304
Let's start with that Foxconn which is a contract manufacturer that we all know and love

54
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
Because they

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Make the iPhone

56
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:51,008
They build a lot of products that you probably not aware of yes the iPhone but also laptops by other manufacturers

57
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,800
Windows machines in particular

58
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
I think they may

59
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
Put some Chromebooks together but

60
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,784
Yeah I mean they must remind me of HTC if you're familiar with HTC which many people are not these days because they're kind

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Going downhill

62
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
They were at like a manufacturer

63
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
Picture of phones

64
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:10,208
Specifically and then decided to Branch out and make their own stuff

65
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,048
And put their brand and logo on things and I don't know if that's what fox

66
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,608
Complaints to do I suspect actually not

67
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,472
If they purchase Belkin for the 866 million dollars that they plan to spend on it

68
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:27,616
I don't think a Belkin name goes away I don't think you see Foxconn on anyting

69
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,456
Most of you guys are probably some

70
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
Belkin owns

71
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
Couple things that

72
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Like hey it's the Belkin

73
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
Batteries cables

74
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,880
Accessories

75
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:44,256
Absolutely so they do all that but they also own the WeMo brand of connected home devices

76
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
Which includes Outlets

77
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
Lights switches and

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
Pics of sensors they also own fin

79
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,496
I got a joint venture with fin which actually is a smart leak detection

80
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,592
Company that is actually sold through plumber so it's a different distribution

81
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
It's not right to consume

82
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:05,760
And then they also have the Linksys brand of routers that way back in the day Cisco bought Linksys

83
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Because you know

84
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
Radish Wikipedia

85
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,880
Hot Because the Internet was going to be hot and then Cisco is like

86
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Falcon

87
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,744
All of these things are now

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
Possibly going to Foxconn

89
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,167
I say possibly because this is a deal that probably will be subject to approval from the US committee on foreign

90
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
Investment

91
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
So

92
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
Dismay

93
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
Not happen

94
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
This committee has recent

95
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
The kibosh on broadcom

96
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Qualcomm

97
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:38,527
And that idea here is that you don't want to let foreign companies by strategic assets for the

98
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,135
I would imagine that the same committee that's involved with saying

99
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
Don't buy Huawei phones in the US which apparently had to carrier deals earlier this year

100
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
Basically fall through Verizon and AT&T

101
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:56,447
So you can't buy Huawei phones unless you buy direct or through

102
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
Amazon

103
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,799
Payback Best Buy's dropping a line as well for the same types of recents

104
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,639
Sew-in given this Administration which we just don't know how this

105
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
So there's that

106
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
Now what

107
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
I think it's kind of

108
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,015
Interesting here in Kevin and I tried to find a

109
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
Got this out we don't know who makes

110
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
Has been in business since 1983

111
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,999
Its Revenue last year was what was its Revenue Kevin

112
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,399
700 and let me get the exact number for 789 million

113
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
Dollars

114
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
This is not

115
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
Awesome deal this is not

116
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,871
Exactly this sounds like maybe welcome site

117
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Let's have an X

118
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,967
So what I find most interesting is

119
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
This idea

120
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,319
Contract manufacturers getting into

121
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:49,695
Its own branded line of stuff so is it going to what does that mean for a company like Flex

122
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
Here in the US that are also big contra

123
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
Best manufacturers

124
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:58,655
They've actually seen their businesses change a lot all of these companies in the last cup

125
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
Couple of years probably

126
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:05,055
Last for five years as more connected devices come on the

127
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,127
So they're investing a lot in

128
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,735
Helping companies that were not in the tech manufacturing space get into

129
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,527
It's so when I visited Flex

130
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
Example of couple

131
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:20,927
It's back I saw that they had a partnership with a clothing manufacturer to make smart clothing

132
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
And

133
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
They had a whole team of Engineers that

134
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,071
Just like testing out crazy stuff to offer

135
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,631
Non tech companies in Partnership

136
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:34,495
And I thought that was kind of like an interesting way to move that business forward a little bit

137
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
I'm curious if we'll see them try to buy their own stuff and kind of go upmarket if you remember it's a possibility

138
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
I don't know

139
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:48,831
Yeah I don't know if that's a tough call it and it's I think it's very challenging for a contract manufacturer to do their own thing

140
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:54,719
You know they're behind the scenes company they're not known to Consumers by name I don't know I mean

141
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:00,351
Part of me says maybe they're buying this for the patents apparently r700 patents involved in this deal as well

142
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
Petabytes

143
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,471
I know they were saying and we're about to see a lot of patent Act

144
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
Activity in

145
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
Consumer IO

146
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
He's so maybe but

147
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
I don't know

148
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
I just I feel like

149
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,431
It's tough for a company like this to

150
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
Make your own

151
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,015
Stuff and sell and also make

152
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,623
Gear for other companies that may compete in the same space that that's going to be an issue I think

153
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,999
And for consumers that are sitting there going to wait I liked my Belkin stuff

154
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:32,863
For the US and now I don't know if I'm going to trust routers from China I thought this instantly

155
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
I was like

156
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
China is a scary place with a surveillance technology

157
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Bent

158
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
But I would say to you that

159
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
A lot of you probably have tp-link

160
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
Gear with

161
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Which is a Chinese

162
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
Yeah

163
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
Maybe

164
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
Maybe you should

165
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
I do that feels like

166
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,087
That is what we know about this deal

167
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,415
So let's move on to our other big story which is

168
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
Facebook

169
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,535
We'll just call it Facebook and just data

170
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
Data over Beach I mean

171
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,167
Everybody coming to grips and being aware that this is happening

172
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
When we've been talking about it

173
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Are your side

174
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:15,871
Yeah I mean we all knew that Facebook and they're not the only one obviously but Facebook was collecting our data

175
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Right

176
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
You always say you are the product

177
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
You're using something like Facebook

178
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
This is a mess because

179
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:28,159
It's still a question of did Facebook really do anything wrong when it comes to third parties getting access to that

180
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Data

181
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,511
Through various apis and creating apps on Facebook

182
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
Quizzes and so on and so forth

183
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
So

184
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:40,703
I'm still in kind of trying figure out do I blame Facebook or do I not for one thing and I don't know how you feel about that

185
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
I think what we're

186
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
This is an apple

187
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,823
I think this is us coming to Reckoning

188
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,895
Reckoning with the model that we built

189
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,967
And you see this in this type of

190
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:56,063
Conversation but you also see this right now with all the paintballs that are being erected

191
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
For various

192
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Journalism sites

193
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
Write the internet used to be

194
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
Free and

195
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,743
Everybody was open it was free it was all these things

196
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
And what's happening is

197
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,095
We're gradually locking away parts of

198
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:15,263
That doesn't have to be a bad thing I know you know anytime you take away something that was free it feels awful but it's all

199
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,591
I also like we talked about with iot the business models

200
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,687
But we've accepted somewhere like wait a second what is this mean

201
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
Maybe I don't want to accept that

202
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
I don't think people really understood

203
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
Entirely

204
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
Not what they were getting into but the ramen

205
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Applications of

206
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
And you can see these ramifications

207
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
Like we talked about

208
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,535
Digitization makes everything searchable by

209
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,631
So it's much more accessible in a way that it isn't mine just

210
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
You're relying on

211
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
People's memory

212
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
Right and then

213
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,799
It is also stored forever even these stupid things that you don't even

214
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,127
And it can be instantly search so

215
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,271
When you have those dumb tweets that you fired off at 2 a.m. during your college Years you know that maybe you're like

216
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Oh yeah

217
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
I don't think that

218
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
It's still there

219
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,951
And that people are coming to terms with that they're like I don't like that that's scary

220
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,511
And I think the next step is

221
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,303
Realizing that could be used for

222
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,119
4 and we talked about this a lot on the show but things like

223
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,447
China's kind of surveillance State and what they're doing with their

224
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
Social credit

225
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
That's

226
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
We're not that far from it

227
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,895
I mean ensures they look at in credit card companies they look at Facebook

228
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,687
Understand your credit report

229
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,015
You're right when you say it's we're not that far away and and

230
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,415
China is a perfect example because I don't remember exactly when but I'm going to guess about six months ago so we

231
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
First started on the show talking about the scoring

232
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,535
That China is using for all of its citizens

233
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,095
At the time like I wonder what they're going to do with that

234
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,679
And since then they've done a lot with that in just before the show

235
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
You would point out an article where

236
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
Now if you are jaywalking and

237
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
Shanghai I guess it is

238
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
Shenzhen

239
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
If your jaywalking in Shenzhen

240
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
A camera will notice

241
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,991
You use facial recognition through the system

242
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
To find out who you are

243
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
Put your photo up near that

244
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,623
Street and then send you a text message for your fine

245
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
Mean

246
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
This is moving

247
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,231
Fast once you have a date at start figuring out how to use it

248
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,095
I want to see a quick and easy implementation cuz I know it's not but if that's what it seems like from the outside

249
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,679
Yeah and that is a fully automated Circle right

250
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
That is like

251
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
You break the law

252
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Like a camera sees it

253
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Publicly shame you

254
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,151
I mean ask it all happened before you have finished crossing the street at the

255
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,199
Yeah

256
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
And then everyone

257
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
Fat guy

258
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Don't be that guy

259
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
So bringing this back to Facebook cuz

260
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
That's where I

261
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,999
I feel like I can look what I brought these kind of examples up to

262
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Because maybe they didn't read dystopia

263
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
In science fiction

264
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,399
I'm like hey guys this is

265
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
So

266
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
You know what would make him stop laughing

267
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,055
Doing what I did what's all this news had a couple days back

268
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,127
And I don't know if you did but I would recommend everybody do this just to get

269
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
Some perceptions

270
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
Ideas on visualization here

271
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,247
I downloaded my data file from

272
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
Facebook and I went through it

273
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,367
And mine was not as bad as some people because a lot of people are complaining that

274
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:15,487
Every single call but they have made on their phone or phones that they had Facebook install on

275
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,071
There was a log of those calls who they called how long he spoke etcetera Etc

276
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
I did not have that aspect of it because

277
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,703
Turns out I never enable Messenger to have

278
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,263
My phone number Access and so on so forth

279
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
But

280
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
All of my contacts

281
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
Friends

282
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
Place I checked in

283
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
Every post

284
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Every

285
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,503
Photo it's all there I mean I did was a large file

286
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:43,903
I would recommend people do that just to get some scoop on what they really have you don't think about it but when you see it

287
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,487
It makes you could be a wake-up call in some people need I think

288
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
Yeah well in mind I actually

289
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
I never had Facebook on my phone

290
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
I don't know

291
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Xiamen Facebook

292
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,447
But I did it for Instagram

293
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,847
I had to say yes and then I noticed that yes oh my gosh it had all my calls and that's a

294
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Journalist that's terrifying

295
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
Alex just because

296
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
And are you have sources that you're trying to

297
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
At 10

298
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,271
Think about God what do they know

299
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
The other thing I can recommend is if you go to Google

300
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
Dot-com take out

301
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
You can get your Google

302
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,951
Which is actually to me

303
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
In some ways its carrier

304
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
Because it's so much more

305
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,119
But it's also I knew Google was doing

306
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,959
And I will also say that Google builds a lot of products that make

307
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
Really convenient to share

308
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
The stuff with him

309
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
I'm not saying that's better

310
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
But I am saying that

311
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,127
You know I feel like I get more bang for my buck from Google

312
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:41,247
Ian Connor related it to because I can test back to Facebook in a second so bear with me

313
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
A lot of

314
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,807
People complain about

315
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,343
Privacy aspect of Google

316
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
Which I totally got

317
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,975
You're getting free products and services they're getting your data they're getting ad Revenue Etc

318
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,815
That's all on the consumer side if you don't want that you can actually pay

319
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,119
Free G suite and a Google account

320
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,191
Gmail and all that so much less

321
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
You can't do anything

322
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Well

323
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,335
They don't have the data now so you're not going to get targeted ads and so on and so forth

324
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
But you're right

325
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,687
There's a convenience factor you give up you couldn't complain

326
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,991
Me all the time about this and complain

327
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,551
You can't use Google assistant on Google home

328
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
To its fullest extent with your

329
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,671
Book techniques that with your G Suite account that you have cuz you pay for that

330
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
And Google doesn't mine that data

331
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,047
So bring it back to Facebook I meant to do that for a sorry

332
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Would people actually

333
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
Consider paying for Facebook

334
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
As opposed to using it for free

335
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,823
And not having Facebook collect maybe as much then again it gets back to that lack of convenience you won't be able to do as much with I don't know I don't know the answer

336
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,895
Well the challenge with paying for Facebook is

337
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:45,247
I think if you want people to pay for things you have to become a truly Universal kind

338
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
Platform

339
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,831
Standard right and I don't know if Facebook is actually there

340
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,391
So that's it and we talked about this

341
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,439
For the show but we were talking about cuz

342
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
Facebook the big story for this weekend

343
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Facebook

344
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,839
Is that the data kerfuffle his

345
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Let It Go

346
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,423
Decide not to release some smart home

347
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Products

348
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
At f8 in May

349
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,311
So there's two stories one is from Bloomberg

350
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,871
Saying that it won't release its smart speaker

351
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
And then

352
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,223
The information has a story talking about

353
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,063
A device called portal that would use facial recognition technology

354
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
To help set up video

355
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Friends and family

356
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Facebook

357
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,719
On that device now plans to process and store the video data

358
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
On it rather than in the

359
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Company servers

360
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
So

361
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
And they might even

362
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Andele por

363
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:37,471
I would imagine that's tied to that the smart home speaker or display smart

364
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
Screen

365
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Yeah but

366
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
I got to be honest do you know anybody that wants

367
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,175
It's a product like that from Facebook to begin with even before this date of thing I don't

368
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
I can't

369
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
I just don't

370
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:54,879
I don't I mean Facebook has so many users in so many people use messenger like as their default communication between the

371
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
My friend so

372
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,231
So maybe something like this but this gets to what we were talking to

373
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
My brother uses messenger

374
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
I do not

375
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,607
So we communicate via text

376
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
Because he

377
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
Do you know he sends me messages and I'm like

378
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
I'm not inside

379
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
So

380
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
Horrifying

381
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,151
I don't have an Amazon to talk to some people in

382
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,223
Facebook speaker to talk to some other people in like it's like the

383
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
Free carterfone

384
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Landlines

385
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
The makery

386
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:29,695
And then I realize a lot of people to use Facebook for day-to-day message

387
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:34,303
I use it when I'm on an Android phone with my family because they're all on iPhones I couldn't

388
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,167
You know I can't use iMessage and text and all that but they complain whatever

389
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,007
Yeah that's it is a mess right now it is

390
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
All right

391
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
So let's move on

392
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
From things that are messy to

393
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
Things that are

394
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:54,271
Positive I don't know if it's positive now that we've discussed all this mess but you got a survey from JFK

395
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,879
Found it over 1/4 so 27% of us consumers have more than

396
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
3 smart home devices

397
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
And another

398
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
7%

399
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
On two or three

400
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
It's actually less than

401
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:11,167
So 34% have two or more is another way of saying it I don't know they surveyed

402
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
So that's

403
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:20,127
Yeah and that surprises me a little bit too because it's usually if you buy a smart speaker you tend to buy

404
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
More of them

405
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,247
For other rooms and that's why we have these small products like the echo

406
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
. in the home mini and so on

407
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,135
Sorry I'm a little surprised that it's low on terms of owning multiple

408
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
Mayan

409
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,279
Yeah I mean I can see if you would hang out in one main room and

410
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
But not

411
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
You know I can see it

412
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
Course the group that owns

413
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,935
The most is Millennials age 25 to 34

414
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,519
Their ownership is at 64%

415
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,615
They seem to be the type of people that I guess I'm talking about in terms of having one for every room

416
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,735
What we just talked about almost 7 and 10

417
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Millennials

418
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
Expect devices from

419
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
Avengers 2

420
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,903
That's right cuz people do not want to be in these

421
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
Ecosystems get that through your head

422
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Manufacturers

423
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
I agree

424
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
I agree

425
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,631
Before we forget only cuz this is related to I know we're going to go to some other smaller news items

426
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,215
I noticed that the UK has put a draft out

427
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,823
Establishing survey peyote security principles in the funny thing to me was

428
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
They were very common sense

429
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,687
There are things that we talked about on the show many many times before

430
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,039
It's just a draft I would love to see this come to the US and other countries

431
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
But real quick

432
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
The five items in here are

433
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,159
No default passwords on iot devices

434
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
All companies providing

435
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,535
Devices-and-services must have a public point of contact for reporting issues

436
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,631
Companies must keep all iot software updated yay

437
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,935
Personal data shall be processed and accordingly

438
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,495
Applicable data protection

439
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,543
Is the best y'all

440
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,079
As part of the musky pelayo

441
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
The functionality of

442
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
And

443
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:03,295
Companies must publish an end-of-life policy stating the minimum length

444
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
The time that a device

445
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
Will receive software

446
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
That is our expiration date

447
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Yes

448
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Isaac

449
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,071
And then finally

450
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,143
Customers should be able to delete their personal data easily

451
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,983
Which I totally understand you're going to disable a device tell it whatever replace it so

452
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,543
Yeah this is going to be out for

453
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Public

454
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:31,455
Comed in the UK through April 25th so I'm looking forward to seeing what happens there and I hope this spreads

455
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Me

456
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,087
To this was released by the UK's department for digital culture media and Sport

457
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
So if your look

458
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
Insport okay

459
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,327
Alright so you know if you kick that soccer ball on the

460
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
Left on the pitch last it will know

461
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
And keep your data

462
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
Protective

463
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
There are

464
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
Footballs and basketballs

465
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
I got a cigarette

466
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
All right

467
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
Kevin is

468
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
Pro football

469
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Pro soccer

470
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
Yeah

471
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,503
Let's see let's talk about some short news bits

472
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,695
Here to help you throughout your day here are some things you can try saying to get started

473
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Treetop

474
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,023
Set timer Google sister real quick

475
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,655
You can finally send money to People by asking Google assist

476
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
Let's see what happens

477
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:29,823
I'm going to try it I tried it actually Google it does not support that yet just so people are aware but let's see

478
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
Send $1 to Stacey Higginbotham

479
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
Example you can say

480
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
The first one

481
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
The first one

482
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,551
Alright which payment method do you want to use

483
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
I'll have to tap

484
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:46,719
Sorry for this order

485
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,095
I hooked up my

486
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,191
Yeah there's another way the way I set up on Google pay

487
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,007
Before the show which I connect my PayPal account

488
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,823
I'm going to stop her because she's going to repeat everything I just said

489
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Huh

490
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,127
Interesting

491
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
Oak stop

492
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,735
Well that didn't work at all

493
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,319
Well alright we'll see this is what happens

494
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:17,440
Or pre-recorded demos that will keep in because we want you to experience exactly what it's like

495
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Use

496
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Thanks

497
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,280
Awful maybe because I didn't

498
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:25,376
Connect Google pay to assistant maybe I have to do that first I don't know

499
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
But

500
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
What are the steps that you

501
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240
Or what does it say you should do and what

502
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,592
I don't know if there are any steps other than having

503
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,152
Having Google pay setup

504
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,480
The recipient will have to have Google pay to receive the funds

505
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,856
You even get to that part though I don't think that's it

506
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,184
I don't think that's it and I know that eventually they're just going to have a

507
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
A separate

508
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:54,048
App for this a Google pay send app for peer-to-peer payments but

509
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
Odd

510
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,376
Can I use it on an Android phone to

511
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
All right

512
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Well

513
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
Seriously this is possible

514
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,128
Little Google story Philips Hue scenes are Now natively supported by

515
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Assistant

516
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
Yay

517
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:15,040
If he doesn't remember this is my challenge with my Philips Hue scenes

518
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
I can never remember

519
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
Weatherall called

520
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
If you can remember them

521
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,184
You can now use Google Assistant

522
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
Send it to actually play the scene

523
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
That is correct

524
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,352
It's in the home control settings of the Google home app so you have to do that

525
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,144
They originally supported

526
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,544
Not reason but eventually supported Philips Hue Lights just for the basics right the lights yes but not the same so that's the part that's new

527
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,824
Yes and

528
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,128
You can always support your

529
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,968
Seems like you know me or SmartThings

530
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
And those also work

531
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
Assistant so this is just native

532
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,416
I did notice that Google and Amazon both have a different

533
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,720
Feeling for what a warm white light is

534
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,280
I don't know what I did a video on it and I was like

535
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:02,656
That's weird but if I tell Google to turn my living room lights to a warm White

536
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,216
It turns it to a almost yellow color

537
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,264
But Amazon turns mine too

538
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
A white color

539
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
Daylight

540
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
What they all need

541
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,432
All of these assistants need a setting for

542
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,968
You defining the

543
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,248
Color temperature

544
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
So that way

545
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
I'm going to disagree with you

546
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
Because I don't have any people

547
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,136
I think they should have

548
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:28,512
Universal RGB code cuz that actually exist and they should adopt that

549
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,584
Lakeside whatever Phillips says is warm white they should

550
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,888
My hunch is the API

551
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
Could be

552
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:42,336
I'm going to keep it simple to not have to configure that I agree most people don't want to do that

553
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,128
But I'm not one of those people who want to do that

554
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
People like me

555
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,808
Louis, and I'm going to stay at in the middle

556
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
Yeah that's

557
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,672
The lowest common denominator in the first place

558
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,816
We also have news from particle it is an iot development board

559
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,864
And they have

560
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Acquired

561
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,192
A company called red bear labs

562
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
It is

563
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
Weather

564
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,544
Closest professional partners

565
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,080
Redbear does

566
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
They make

567
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Connectivity

568
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
So this is basically

569
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,736
Is a company that's been making iot

570
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,320
Hardware platforms plus their device cloud and device OS

571
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,624
They really wanted to get deeper on to the

572
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,440
It's interesting that

573
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
Red bear

574
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,512
The first product was a Kickstarter

575
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
Yes just like particle

576
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
Oh well there you go

577
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,888
I'm interested seems interested in me.

578
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,472
A Kickstarter product would be eventually a company gets purchased but

579
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,288
I didn't know particle was a Kickstarter as well

580
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
Or maybe it was an Indiegogo

581
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
It was a crowdfund

582
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,712
Apparently the particle mesh boards that have

583
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
Paris latest

584
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
Version of

585
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,808
Hardware development kits

586
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
They have

587
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
Mesh capabilities for Wi-Fi Bluetooth

588
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,160
Is Aunt

589
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
I think cellular

590
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
Maybe

591
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
Baidu for cellular and yes

592
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,768
So

593
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
Those were developed in conjunction with

594
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,888
They're so you've already seen the results of their collaboration

595
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,960
Just to bring him on in

596
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Yay

597
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:20,384
That is a little bit of news on that front it's it's actually good news because you know I remember when particle

598
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
Particle launched

599
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
They launched with

600
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,992
Dozens of other companies that

601
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,528
We're trading iot development

602
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
Forum boards

603
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,136
Very few of those companies are still around there are still some

604
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
Imagine

605
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,464
Most of them died or just cut it

606
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,280
Went away for lack of you so we're going to see a consolidation

607
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,352
And we also have August

608
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,680
We have been remiss we have not talked about these updates on the August

609
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,264
Locks and doorbell products but in the last month or so

610
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,568
I've been a couple big news items from them

611
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
At

612
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
Nice items will be honest

613
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,944
Is those of you guys who have an August doorbell

614
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,016
Like me now get 24 hours of

615
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
Recordings

616
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Free

617
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:06,208
So this actually I thought was awesome because it's like the doorbell games getting kind of competitive now that Amazon has bought

618
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,488
Ring and

619
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,048
Lawsuits from

620
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,352
Skybell and nest

621
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
But their doorbell

622
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,912
Also basically

623
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
24-hours free

624
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
That's really useful

625
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
I think

626
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,544
Cuz if you missed the call you can go right back and see

627
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,360
And then they've been able to

628
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Lock

629
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
On Siri

630
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,504
Yeah you can actually unlock

631
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,600
With Siri using anything but a homepod and I guess

632
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:40,000
The idea there is those are devices you carry with you where is the homepod is in your house or somebody might be able to scream through your door hey hey

633
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
Unlock the door

634
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,328
All right so, do you want to talk about the

635
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,096
Fibaro

636
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:48,192
I do I'm actually going to talk about two things because they're tied together

637
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,496
Because I couldn't use the fibaro plug

638
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,824
Until I set up the Nvidia Shield

639
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
SmartThings link

640
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,920
Because you need SmartThings for the fibaro plug

641
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
Well it's a Z-Wave plug

642
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,504
I'll get more to that in a second

643
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,904
But I just want to mention poor folks who are familiar with SmartThings this basically this USB dongle of East

644
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
SmartThings link

645
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:14,048
Plugs into Nvidia Shield set-top box which is what I have and turns the set-top box into

646
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,840
A SmartThings Hub

647
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,680
I was not that familiar with SmartThings list my first real foray into things

648
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,752
With it I have taken everything off my wink hub

649
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,824
And set it up with SmartThings on the Nvidia Shield

650
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:30,176
And it's no different use the same SmartThings app use the classic app for now

651
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:33,760
And it was fantastic and in fact I'm finding that the

652
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
USB

653
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,368
Dongle which houses the zigbee and Z-Wave radios

654
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,720
Has much better range than I found in the past mother products hubs in particular

655
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:47,328
I don't have to put my Z-Wave devices for example real close to the hub

656
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
Which is outstanding so

657
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,656
Having said all that

658
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,192
What's the weather tomorrow plugged in

659
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,496
Because I had to use it with SmartThings

660
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
It's

661
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,080
It's very nicely designed it like all of them

662
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,640
List of all products it is essentially a

663
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,688
Three prong outlet that you plug in

664
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:08,576
It monitors in real-time the amount of energy that's being used by something is plugged into it

665
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:13,952
You can also know if you're using SmartThings you can turn it on and off remotely

666
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
Outside the US

667
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,048
Deport which is very very nice to have

668
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
And it's

669
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:24,960
Also designed so that it doesn't take up any rooms that you can still use the second Outlet in your wall which is awesome

670
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,312
Yeah this is a Z-Wave model again with the USB plug

671
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
So

672
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,616
The interesting thing is

673
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:38,016
Even with SmartThings and I had to install a custom device Handler that tomorrow provided me in order to get it to work with SmartThings

674
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,624
I can see it I can remotely turn it on and off in the app

675
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:48,000
I can see how much juice it's using right now our voicemail Raspberry Pi is running on it

676
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,536
It has even peaked at more than

677
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,328
2 Watts at any given time

678
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
So that's obviously a low-power device

679
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
The little LED ring around

680
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
The front

681
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,728
The plug

682
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,056
It will glow in a different color based on how much output

683
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,872
Energy is being used so that's really cool

684
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:09,760
I can't do much on the automation side and that's really because to do that you need the fibaro

685
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,600
Controller which is their Hub and I don't have that so I would love

686
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
Smart things to say

687
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
Hey when

688
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,256
Certain devices turned on in my wife's hair dryer in the morning after she takes a shower

689
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,072
Turn on the lights downstairs cuz that's what she's going next

690
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,864
Every single day without fail

691
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,912
But I can't do that type of automation

692
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:31,264
Solely through SmartThings unfortunately so if you're going to be limited if you don't have enough

693
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,032
Sbarro

694
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Controller

695
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
Other than that

696
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,872
Really nice I like it

697
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,456
I like I like it and how much is it and would you pay that

698
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:45,856
It's you that's the thing tomorrow pricing there tend to be a little bit higher like if I go back to see my remote inside

699
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,416
Switch and I think that might have cost me thirty bucks

700
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,744
This Is 50 without the USB

701
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
60 with USB

702
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,352
You are

703
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
Okay

704
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
And now

705
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
Let's go

706
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,448
2

707
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,520
Are this week

708
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:08,640
This is the last so basically if you send us a voicemail

709
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,688
By the end of this month so

710
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,320
Say as of midnight on the 31st of March and will call that midnight Central Time

711
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,160
You will be entered to win a wyze camera

712
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
So

713
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
All right

714
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,792
Voicemail I should tell you to call

715
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,840
Where to call five one two

716
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,376
6 to 3

717
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
7 4

718
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
And

719
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,264
Today we have a question from Dom about smart

720
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,896
Fox today's iot podcast listener hotline is brought to you by Schlage maker of electronic locks

721
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:45,504
Schlage electronic locks make life so much easier and more convenient

722
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,624

Hey Stacy

726
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
My name is Dom

727
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,560
Actually I find it a little bit ironic that

728
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,376
That message was brought to me by Schlage smart locks

729
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,424
Because I actually had a question about a Smart Lock

730
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,216
I was wondering I've been seeing

731
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,240
Smart locks around in

732
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,032
Interested in getting one

733
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,312
My house but

734
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,360
What is the

735
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,176
Standard for or what is the normal practice

736
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,224
What to do with the

737
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,320
Because usually I see the smart locks they only really replace

738
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,344
Like a deadbolt

739
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
Or like

740
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
Two smart locks

741
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,512
For one door or is there a Smart Lock where they're connected to

742
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,792
Or do you have

743
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:33,632
Smart deadbolt and then a regular door handle with a lock built in

744
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:38,240
Which kind of seems to me to defeat the purpose of having a Smart Lock if you have one of them

745
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,800
That's digitally locked in the other one that has to have

746
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
Cuz I ain't know the goal to me is to

747
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,408
Remove the key from the equation that way

748
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,200
With you

749
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
So I was

750
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,272
Just curious whether you have done

751
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,808
This on at your house

752
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,624
Speak on that topic or

753
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
You've heard of

754
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,720
Anyone else doing it I just don't know what to do like what's the standard package

755
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,768
When you're replacing regular locks

756
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,536
Smart locks

757
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
Just one

758
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,888
If you can speak on that I would really appreciate

759
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,912
Preciate it thanks

760
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,728
Okay. This is a really good question

761
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:13,824
And I'm still at Kevin answer because right now it is thundering and my dog

762
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
Going.

763
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:23,808
Yes so it is a good question because a lot of people do have both a

764
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,368
Keylog as well as a keyed deadbolt

765
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,160
Unfortunately.

766
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,184
Most if not

767
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,488
All the locks that I can think of

768
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,792
Tend to work with the deadbolt only

769
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,072
In which case

770
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,608
Yeah the key to part

771
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
Traditional lager

772
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,936
Becomes kind of moot

773
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,240
We have one and I don't like that at all

774
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:48,384
It would be nice if we could see that ice maker is take that into consideration for people who want a key lock as well that maybe they

775
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,992
That works in conjunction with the deadbolt but right now it seems to be deadbolt only

776
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,040
So you would have to leave that

777
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
Main door lock

778
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,624
Unlock all the time if that's your situation

779
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,672
What is the key lock in the door knob

780
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,816
Well that would be for if you maybe you didn't have a deadbolt at first maybe you added a deadbolt later

781
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,400
Minister minimum level of security are you going to get

782
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,448
Yeah you're going to have a key door lock

783
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,496
And then maybe you add

784
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:18,336
The deadbolt door as a secondary thing but no matter what your front door's always going to come in at

785
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
Keyed door lock

786
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,432
Okay yes and I never really thought about this

787
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,504
Because yes I do have one and we just leave it alone

788
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
Same as me

789
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
So that's your thoughts

790
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,392
Process. And if you're looking at this sort of thing

791
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:35,232
Think carefully about what you're looking for in a Smart Lock

792
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:40,352
There's things like the August and those don't have key pads at all they're just remote

793
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,376
Lock and unlock

794
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,936
There's things like the Kevo which also don't have it

795
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,704
Keypad

796
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
Press it in

797
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:50,080
It's theoretically unlocks mine was a little iffy sometimes

798
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,688
And then there are those with keypads and those are candy because you don't actually need your phone you can just

799
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,992
Punch in the keypad number and then it opens

800
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,064
But the remote connectivity is also nice because then you can set up

801
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
Cool like

802
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,600
Automations

803
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
So

804
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,904
There's a whole wide world

805
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Blocks out there

806
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,208
All of the Bluetooth ones

807
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,512
Be aware that if you're going to buy a Bluetooth lock

808
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,304
Did you just going to

809
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:15,168
Need your phone to be around it and you can't do anything remotely

810
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:15,936
To unlock it

811
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
R Lockett

812
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,240
Unless you have one of their

813
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,568
They sell these Bluetooth Wi-Fi converters that are basic

814
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,896
If you have a Z-Wave or zigbee lock

815
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,736
You're going to tie that into a something like a wink or SmartThings Hub

816
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,040
And then you're going to have remote access

817
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,112
Those are just some things to consider as you

818
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:34,880
You're buying

819
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,720
All right I think that's it for this portion of the show

820
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:45,376
We have Leslie Saxon who's talk about the future of healthcare you're definitely want to hear that because it's it's

821
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,912
It's a little surprising her vision

822
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:53,568
And a message from our sponsor, hey everyone we are taking a break for The Intern

823
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:59,968
Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Samsung artik and we're going to be talking about the end of

824
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,760
Was Sarah Peach

825
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,320

826
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
At Samsung

827
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:08,416
Just a reminder for our listeners what is Samsung

828
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
Samsung

829
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
Smart iot

830
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,304
Keep that phone is an enterprise-grade peyote plant

831
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
That combines

832
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
Hardware

833
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,936
Cloud services with built-in security

834
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,752
Peaches and ecosystem of tools and totnes

835
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,288
What we're trying to do is help

836
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,592
Customers get to Market pasta with c

837
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Secure and scalable

838
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,640
Iot Solutions

839
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,968
Okay and what is Samsung doing in the industrial space

840
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,504
With a Samsung

841
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,624
We are trying to help a number of different industrial customer

842
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,928
One of the key groups of the industrial OEM

843
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:46,304
So these are companies that want to develop connected, and they want to deliver services

844
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
Based on those connected products

845
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,656
The date if it's coming from those products another group

846
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,936
Is manufacturer

847
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,704
Initiative

848
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,336
Integrated looking to Ida manage the assets better or to get better insight into that productivity

849
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,408
And what kind of use cases are you seeing soap

850
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:06,016
Wishing a very wide range of use cases for the most common one we have

851
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,064
Is asset management

852
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,600
Either an oem is wanting to

853
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,880
To track and understand

854
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,672
The usage of an asset

855
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,232
Being deployed in the field or a manufacturer

856
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,072
Please try to understand the productivity of the assets

857
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
A usage and the health

858
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
Of that acid

859
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,424
We actually have a very exciting

860
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:29,568
On improving efficiency of plant workers in an assembly process work

861
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,360
Spend a lot of time checking

862
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,152
On pot inventory levels

863
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,432
Got something wasted time

864
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,736
Go to check the level and it's still fine

865
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:40,064
$2 taking a break from the other activity joke

866
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,112
Working together with a couple of Partners

867
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,392
Shoreline iot

868
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,672
And high packs

869
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
We're helping that customer

870
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,792
Can monitor their inventory in real time and that is still

871
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:54,144
Communicate to the workers on the plant for what's going on with that invent relevel

872
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,192
How we do that is with wearable

873
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:00,288
Samsung Gear SmartWatches for the one by those were cousin guide those workers

874
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,360
As to when and where replenishment is needed

875
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:07,712
K&S you built these things what do you see as some of the big challenges

876
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
Customers have

877
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,040
Seeing customers

878
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:17,440
To need a very clear veginal investment for the iot project it's important for them to be able to do

879
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
Define that

880
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,488
Before the project begin

881
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,792
And really understand what the value by Disney

882
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,072
Timing for that value

883
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:29,472
We also seeing customers for whom iot security is a big concern so it's a very important for them to do

884
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,240
Sign in security

885
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
From the outside

886
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,568
And a Samsung artik

887
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,384
Already helped with a multitude of security service

903
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400
All right

904
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,936
Soccer socks and thanks so much

905
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,472
Coming on the show this week

906
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,776
It's great to be here at South Pine to see you

907
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,592
Awesome okay so let's just Dive Right In

908
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:42,688
You are talking about a wholesale change in the way we get medical care

909
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
Edgewater

910
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,224
Connected

911
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,808
Well telemedicine I assumed as part of this their wearables are all

912
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,088
Kinds of crazy stuff Soto

913
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,112
Talk to me about your vision

914
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:55,232
Great I'm actually here at South by Southwest talking about to be part of that vision is part of the IEEE

915
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,280
Tech for Humanity series

916
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,816
Can a few different years and

917
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:05,216
As the program has about them now talking about a really important part of building the new healthcare

918
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
And that's Iris security

919
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,056
So we talked about that at this meet

920
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,080
Eating about how to protect

921
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,896
Digital Data one of the great things about

922
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,432
Digital health is that

923
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:18,528
It has the potential to really support the health care of every individual

924
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,600
Digitally anybody with access to the internet

925
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
So that's kind of a Phenom

926
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,976
People who live in places without infrastructure

927
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,768
People get Healthcare anywhere

928
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,560
Iview what is

929
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,096
A very important movement

930
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,888
Healthcare because instead of sort of

931
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,984
Dummy down Healthcare and making it the quality and experience for everybody

932
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,544
Digital Health can make at the Four Seasons experience forever

933
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,824
That's what everybody

934
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
Desserts

935
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,640
Be able to access the best

936
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,920
Technologies

937
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,480
Expertise that Healthcare provides so

938
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,248
We sing

939
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,016
That

940
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,088
Virtual care will constitute 80% of Medical Care in

941
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
And that

942
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,392
Bricks-and-mortar care

943
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
Hospital visits

944
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,952
Clinic visits will be maybe

945
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
90%

946
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,000
Why is that good

947
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,816
First of all it's good because you're leveraging your experts

948
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
Over

949
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,352
More people

950
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,656
Secondly it's good because

951
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,728
You can reach more people on thirdly it's really cost

952
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
But it's complicated

953
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,080
Okay that was a lot to take in

954
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:19,968
First off when does this Future come about where 80% of our care is done via some sort of

955
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
Internet-based care

956
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
Part of it's already happened

957
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,552
I think we're seeing it

958
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
Last

959
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,624
What 3-4 years

960
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,904
When no Americans

961
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,488
We're tracking her health even with non medical grade sensors

962
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,048
About thirty 40% of Americans have it some

963
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:38,912
Quantify themselves with a wrist-worn or some other type of activity sensor just with

964
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,680
Their phone

965
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:46,080
So what we're seeing now is we're seeing this sort of merger of personally collected Healthcare data with traditional data

966
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,408
So you know Apple announced this ability to support

967
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
Are there platform

968
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,712
Traditional Medical

969
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,528
Electronic medical data as well as personal data

970
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,296
And so

971
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:59,904
We're now moving toward that virtual care Vision Telehealth is one small step

972
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
It doesn't really scale

973
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,232
I'll tell housemates as you can get a docker

974
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,256
Toronto screen a realtor

975
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
And that's good

976
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:10,400
But we're trying to do is beyond that so we've created a virtual human me

977
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
Simon expert in cardiac rhythm disorder

978
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,544
And my virtual human is fueled by voice recognition AI

979
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,128
She can provide unbelievable in-depth content to you

980
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,176
And a very deeply personal way

981
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,968
When you see my virtual human

982
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,040
Do you mean this is personalized to you or is this just

983
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,088
Something you built that is a virtue

984
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
So

985
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
Now it's very easy to create

986
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,440
Very realistic furniture

987
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
This looks like me

988
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,792
So this is your digital twin with your health data

989
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
Yes this is my digital

990
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,888
Play who after you see me in a clinic Hazard if you've never met me

991
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,448
Senior Living in Bangladesh you can ask me questions about heart

992
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
Rhythm disorders

993
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
Am I

994
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,032
Answers are based on

995
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,080
30 years of experience answering

996
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,360
Impatience questions and every

997
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
Buddy L Seidel who answer page

998
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,175
Questions

999
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,711
Data-driven guideline

1000
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,503
Data

1001
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,551
Lies to you because it's an AI engine

1002
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
I can learn

1003
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,879
And has already templated 36

1004
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,415
Questions commonly asked question

1005
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:08,511
And it gets smarter and smarter so what we found is that people

1006
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
Feel

1007
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:13,375
Learn and understand better when they are in control you're not pushing information

1008
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
To them they're pulling it

1009
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
When they want it

1010
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,959
Plus my virtual human is

1011
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,495
Constantly in the same mood

1012
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,287
She's very interested she's

1013
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,823
My virtual human has

1014
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,847
Standardizing

1015
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:26,175
Information doesn't deliver one way one day

1016
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
Smarter than me

1017
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,479
She doesn't prescribe yet

1018
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,039
But since you'll be able to read the emotion in your face

1019
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,831
And understand how you're feeling about some

1020
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,415
But she'll get smarter and smarter so that virtual human

1021
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,231
Really scales I think one of the first things we have to build out

1022
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,767
In this virtual system is

1023
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,559
High-end medical information form

1024
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,631
In the virtual care system it's not the usual

1025
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,447
Paternalistic care of the patient is has unimpressive

1026
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,983
Play control their the orchestra

1027
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,263
Just like other things

1028
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,567
You decide when you're going to read The Wall Street Journal

1029
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,591
Purses that have posed for

1030
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
Whatever

1031
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
Patience

1032
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:00,479
They access things when they want they disclose things when they want

1033
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
They can

1034
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,783
Retrieve deeply personal for

1035
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,063
Formation that's a super hard thing

1036
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,391
Can you get the other things that I'm trying to sell for just

1037
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Yours

1038
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,975
It's frustrating to try and deliver excellent Medical Care is

1039
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743
The gaps

1040
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:17,119
We have the best experts and Technologies in the world how did we leave it all together for a patient there fam

1041
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,191
How do we allow them to deeply learn things they don't get so

1042
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,471
Traumatized by

1043
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,543
No major diagnosis for chronic diseases they have to deal with

1044
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
And I think

1045
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,591
We can make that a lot better

1046
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
Potential

1047
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:33,247
So we're really on The Cutting Edge of building all the things that it takes and we want these experience to happen everywhere

1048
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,527
In your car

1049
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,551
Airplane

1050
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
I can't wait till I'm in a plane and I'm like

1051
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,647
Oh my gosh virtual doctor

1052
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,927
I'm having a panic attack

1053
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,487
Just think about how disgusting

1054
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,767
Planes are and how they're not healthy

1055
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
Now they could be

1056
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
It could be a place to Enlighten for

1057
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,423
I love planes I love playing this kind of

1058
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,263
I do everything like a car to play this kind of iPhone I just have to build house offer

1059
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
Turn Services on

1060
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:02,687
Okay well let's back up just a little bit because I want to talk about the pieces that need to be in place cuz you've mentioned

1061
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,735
And obviously software in Crazy places

1062
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
Or to be

1063
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,319
I feel crazy you've also mentioned personalized

1064
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599
Not just you

1065
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
Being

1066
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,951
Export it someplace but also a personalized experience based on

1067
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,767
My personal health which implies machine learning

1068
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,839
Or models about me so let's break down the

1069
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,399
Pieces that need to be in place to deliver this kind

1070
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,959
First of all we need to be able to

1071
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,751
Get information from you

1072
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
Anytime

1073
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
Right

1074
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,591
That's medical-grade diagnostic information

1075
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,639
Pretty good so

1076
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,967
We have a lot of those things already I can get real-time EKG from anybody

1077
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
I can get

1078
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,783
A lot of physiologic sensor soon

1079
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,063
Will be able to get metabolic

1080
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
Information

1081
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:44,415
Continuous glucose lactate blood values that allow me to make it

1082
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,231
Safe decision and allow you to understand your

1083
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,047
We need to provide people with very high and

1084
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,327
Information that's personal

1085
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:55,423
It's easy to say you get a diagnosis of breast cancer to do a Google search

1086
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,959
It's very different if you're pre-med

1087
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,751
Tulsa breast cancer

1088
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,799
How do you continue to get

1089
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
A very meaningful

1090
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,615
Shred to you how do you understand

1091
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,663
How your environment may impact your wrist

1092
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,967
If you have a genetic predisposition or something

1093
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,015
So it's a combination of

1094
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
Contacts

1095
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
Learning

1096
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,599
And being able to be on you early

1097
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,927
What sensors understand how you're feeling where you are where you go

1098
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,487
And collect that data and then sort of rational

1099
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,815
It's a very difficult challenge because even in my area

1100
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,839
Cardiac rhythm

1101
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,887
I'm seeing data for instance we have

1102
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,191
Programs in performance military athletic

1103
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,031
The warfighters are professional athletes that

1104
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,335
Isn't my area of expertise but because it's

1105
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
Continuous data

1106
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
I'm not used to seeing

1107
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,407
So

1108
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,431
I don't know what it means

1109
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,711
And it scares me

1110
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,247
That's why I have to Benchmark

1111
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,271
Two things I do know

1112
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
And I have to wait

1113
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,855
Collect clinical events trailer

1114
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
Dangerous is at

1115
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:51,999
So it's going to take a fair amount of Science and patience to do that but given the amount of data use

1116
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,047
Accumulate so fast that will happen you know

1117
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,583
Exponentially faster than

1118
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,863
Medical progress is half

1119
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,447
So this kind of clinically valuable data

1120
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,519
Seems like a key element and then understanding what

1121
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:07,871
To make of it like my doctor have a cardiologist and he does not want to see any of my

1122
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,711
So

1123
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,247
It feels like we need both

1124
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,527
Advice for

1125
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,319
Medical grade information gathering

1126
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,855
But then also

1127
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,135
The studies

1128
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
Will say to you

1129
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,439
Hey

1130
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,231
Here's a 10-year history of someone in

1131
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,047
And here's with this sort of pattern over that 10 years books

1132
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,095
Correct are people doing that work

1133
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
Yeah we're doing that

1134
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,167
Work so we can start to develop

1135
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,703
The Predictive Analytics but the

1136
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,751
Wrist-worn and other senses are getting

1137
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,775
Continue get more active

1138
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,079
Any one of I think RX

1139
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,615
Expertise in the centers we can take

1140
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,407
A regulated sensor

1141
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,223
Reply to an athlete or Warfighter in it

1142
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,759
Non-regulated sensor

1143
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,063
Reply to a patient it doesn't matter it's all going to be the same

1144
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,111
Wellness will merge with

1145
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,647
What's chronic diseases Halo continue

1146
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,439
Tomorrow weather 1.1 August 2nd

1147
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,975
Another pointer Daiso

1148
00:46:55,487 --> 00:47:01,631
How do we get the most hated we can to start that deliver meeting back and when you have more people delivering the state

1149
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,215
Collated and contextualize it it's really important

1150
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:09,823
So we talked about having sensor data what about the human environment

1151
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,175
Privacy environment what other aspects do we need to consider when we're talking about

1152
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,223
Virtual care I don't even know what to call this

1153
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
Avocado

1154
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,783
Virtual care no more

1155
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
Continuous model

1156
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:23,391
So it's really complicated right just a regulatory isb

1157
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,183
Because digital is

1158
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,207
Right it's not

1159
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975
Border

1160
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
So hot

1161
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
I think of data

1162
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
We definitely are

1163
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
Previous

1164
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,839
Conception of data keeping

1165
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,143
What's good to keep a private lock it away

1166
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,191
Digital health is slightly

1167
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,007
So we've been working for instance with the FDA

1168
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,543
Weird about the global

1169
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,359
Model for what software for help to regulate

1170
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,383
Chloe

1171
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,663
That's been a huge accomplishment

1172
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:49,247
Over the last say three four years so that was pretty clear guidelines

1173
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,807
What's a regulated vs. unregulated piece of soft

1174
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,599
What about cyber security

1175
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,903
Text Achilles heel of digital health

1176
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,183
To have health data breach

1177
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,487
Cybersecurity is really a

1178
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,255
Control shift

1179
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,023
It's more

1180
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,303
I think about it like

1181
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,375
You know it started with sort of young people at the drive-in

1182
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
I feel like

1183
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,167
It starts with

1184
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,447
Things like how to say

1185
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:13,311
Create culture awareness of what are good cyber habits because cybersecurity is

1186
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
Shared responsibility

1187
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,663
The patient the manufacturer of the widget

1188
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687
The tax

1189
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,735
The cell phone maker the carrier right

1190
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
The government

1191
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:26,111
So we have to start to build resiliency in our system cybersecurity will be something we have to

1192
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,391
Continuously deal with

1193
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:30,463
Don't be breaches but we have to build resilience systems and that's

1194
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,255
All the way down the chain

1195
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,559
So we work very hard on that

1196
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:38,655
So along the issue of cybersecurity closely related to this is privacy

1197
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,447
And I will say that my mom

1198
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,727
It's probably at 1 far end

1199
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,007
The spectrum that she is

1200
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
So

1201
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,055
So worried

1202
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
Privacy

1203
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,103
She keep seeing

1204
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,199
Seeing stories about pharmaceutical companies wanting to use patient data to help

1205
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:51,967
Improve

1206
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,991
Trek discovery

1207
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,295
And things like that really freaked her

1208
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,575
Her out so I think is

1209
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,367
We have these discussions about Cyrus

1210
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,647
Security we should also talk

1211
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,183
What's happening in

1212
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
The Privacy Rule

1213
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:06,303
So there's privacy in the sense that you don't want your name disclosed or associated with

1214
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:12,447
Right and then there's the ability to take large amounts of data for instance let's say you want to look at all approved drugs

1215
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:16,287
And try to look at all the outcome measures that you have on those trucks to see if you

1216
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,311
You can use them for others

1217
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,103
I don't think anybody would have jacks

1218
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,639
So that's the kind of

1219
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,663
In a really

1220
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,199
Important area then there's

1221
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,479
This privacy discussion

1222
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,039
The societies

1223
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:27,807
Impressions

1224
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,855
Feelings about privacy are highly generation

1225
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:33,695
To your mother may feel very intrusive to share any bit of data

1226
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:36,511
2 yoga person they may give up an enormous amount of data

1227
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,279
For the greater

1228
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,047
Could not

1229
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,863
Concerned about it so privacy is a really in

1230
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
Part of this

1231
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,983
Pick one of the tenants of cyber security and privacy is that an individual should

1232
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,007
Have the ability to

1233
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,799
To take them self off

1234
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,431
She may be giving your heart rate or giving dated insurance company to show that you're healthy to get a lower

1235
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,735
Rate for life insurance or health insurance

1236
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,783
You may be voluntarily giving day to you

1237
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,575
Employer so you don't want to do that

1238
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,647
You should be able to take yourself off

1239
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,671
But that right without pain

1240
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,975
We're seeing this play out a lot professional

1241
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,839
Princess professional NBA players just putting their last negotiating agreement that they won't

1242
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,119
Where player

1243
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,143
Performance sensors

1244
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:14,911
Because

1245
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,215
They don't know if the data is accurate

1246
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,239
They don't know how it's going

1247
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,519
Secure

1248
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,799
And so

1249
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,871
Part of that that has to be explained to them

1250
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,175
I think that kind of thing

1251
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,711
Gift of the governance around

1252
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,991
It before you start to

1253
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,527
Developing that's all go

1254
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,295
Start to happen

1255
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,831
What are the policies around

1256
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,599
The governor

1257
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,903
Medical Data that's collected

1258
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
Performance or for health

1259
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:41,023
And we don't we have HIPAA everyone don't worry about it

1260
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:41,791
Is HIPAA a enough

1261
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,327
It was a very small

1262
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
Pizza Hut

1263
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:47,167
You know it's really about the collective data in your own ability to cut

1264
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
Control your data

1265
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,471
Because it was clear to us in

1266
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,031
When we started building the virtual care system

1267
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:57,407
I look around everybody I said late when I got to do this the wrong way before we go. Let's figure out what are values admission is

1268
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,711
Our mission is to supply the best

1269
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,271
Healthcare to everybody on the globe anytime

1270
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,575
And we are directed toward the patient

1271
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,391
Or the athlete or the Warfighter that is our interest

1272
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
Not

1273
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:12,255
The medical system not the government not the lead not the team it's the individual

1274
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:15,583
That helps us a lot as we start to determine what the government

1275
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
HEB

1276
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,423
It is trying to represent the best interests of the individual is providing the day

1277
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:22,239
One thing I worry about with this sort of effort

1278
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,543
Is in the internet we have

1279
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,079
Continually pushed

1280
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,359
The burden of

1281
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,383
Handling

1282
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:34,271
Ticketing at ticketing is just the easiest thing I can think of right now but even bill paying all of this the bird

1283
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,319
Chest back to the individual there's a lot of

1284
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,343
There's a lot of effort

1285
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,623
Were there and so on

1286
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,415
Curious what it means

1287
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,207
What the role of the individual is

1288
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,743
This individual

1289
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,279
Continuous virtual

1290
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,863
That's a great question I wish I was asked more to really insightful

1291
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,631
Question answer

1292
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,727
This is going to be different it's not doctor tells you what to do

1293
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,799
This is having a real stake a dog in the fight

1294
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:01,407
In your own Healthcare and controlling it and I think that that's the only way we get behavioral change

1295
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,687
Is we get engagement

1296
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,551
If people have to convince themselves and learn that they feel better with healthier habits it's better for them

1297
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,575
Whoever there

1298
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,135
Take care of whether it's their kids their parents their spouse

1299
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:14,463
So I I'm all for it but does require a lot more

1300
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,231
Without

1301
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
Keeping patients down on the farm

1302
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,559
Staff to understand their drugs

1303
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:23,423
There to engage in their care and they have to partner with us to make it better because I I don't

1304
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,703
I spend a lot of time

1305
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
Interrogating a patient

1306
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:30,079
Like I'm a cop on did you do this or that and then feeling judge I want them to come to me

1307
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
As a partner

1308
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,199
And I'm going to add my little expertise and I'm going to be Captain Sully on the Hudson

1309
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,295
Because I need translators 34 years old to sit there and interrogate patients

1310
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,855
And everybody

1311
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,415
I've done that for too long I really want to be able to

1312
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,951
Focus on the people who need me

1313
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,255
Everybody else feel care for

1314
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,791
And protected but

1315
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,071
Takes a lot of

1316
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,351
Personal responsibility

1317
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,375
From the patient

1318
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:56,191
And the pair models have to follow and they're not there yet

1319
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:59,263
The business is going to meet so many needs

1320
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,543
That will create a new

1321
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:07,711
