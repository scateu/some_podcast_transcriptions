00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,296
And we have an excellent show for you today we're going to talk about a new

6
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,624
Venture fund investing in Industry 4.0

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,464
We got a fundraising for an iot industrial security company

8
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,536
Got a new solution out for folks

9
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:38,656
On the smart home side Amazon key is now available for your garage

10
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,216

16
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,016
Google Assistant

17
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,296
Will be integrated with

18
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,344
Couple of our favorite smart home devices

19
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:02,976
And for all of you out there who have allergies you're going to want to hear about this wearable EpiPen

20
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,768
Researchers have died

21
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,536
Developed

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:10,144
We're also going to hear it from our sponsor software AG talk about its keeper lacity platform

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
And we've got

24
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,496
Our Guest Danny Huang who helped create the

25
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,568
The iot inspector software that we talked about last week

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,384
He's going to tell us a lot more about

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,968
Data privacy on this thing what it means for your network and

28
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,272
A little bit about what they discovered in the

29
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,552
Few weeks it's been out

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,856
All this and more awaits you

31
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880

Okay Kevin

47
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,408
Let's kick this party off with

48
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
Venture

49
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:31,808
Do a lot of this on the show because most Venture capitalists fund iot stuff just is

50
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
You're part of their regular

51
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
Regular ginormous funds

52
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
But clear Ventures

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
Just announced

54
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
On Wednesday

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,816
A 180 million dollar second fund

56
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
It is dedicated

57
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
Specifically to

58
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
Iot

59
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
It's

60
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
Industry 4.0

61
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
Architectures that

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Will help

63
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
Make this possible

64
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,360
So I talked to one of the co-founders

65
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,432
At Clear Ventures it is Chris rust

66
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,504
And he actually was the second employee Roadrunner

67
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,320
All of you guys were

68
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,904
So here I had a great conversation about

69
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,952
What happens when we connect

70
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
Bunch of machines

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
To each other

72
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,072
One of my favorite insides that he had

73
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
Was

74
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
When we combine

75
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,424
Sensors and sensor data

76
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,520
With machine learning we're basically going to start having machines that

77
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
I can learn from each other

78
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
Way faster

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,408
Then they can learn from us as people

80
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,712
Which means we're going to have to think about

81
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
How to build

82
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,576
Machines that can talk to each other learn from each other trust each other

83
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,648
And do all of this in a way that doesn't involve

84
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
People getting in the

85
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
This is a big

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,744
Crazy idea

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,048
And I'm very excited to see

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
What they do with it

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,144
In terms of the types of Investments they make

90
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:55,520
Clear Ventures is a venture fund that is very technically driven this founder in the other

91
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
The co-founder

92
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,640
Really go deep on architecture their last bundle mosto

93
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
Cloud-based architectures

94
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
But

95
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
This time they're going to go

96
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
Deeper into

97
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
Umai

98
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Probably going to see some

99
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,392
Cool container orchestration news I know you guys are like

100
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,416
Like a block

101
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,952
But it is actually

102
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
For eyes

103
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
It is enough for the entrepreneurs out there who are in these fields you mentioned a eye but there's a

104
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Also

105
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,519
IRT in general Big Data V Garver robotics

106
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
Self-driving vehicles

107
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
It was of the kinds of

108
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
Disruptive

109
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,919
Startups that the clear fund is looking at

110
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
So

111
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
Stay tuned for that

112
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Or

113
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Reach out to them if

114
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
Do you have a brother

115
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Okay

116
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Next Step

117
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
We've got

118
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
Another fundraising

119
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
This is

120
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,559
Yeah we don't know if it's his Voodoo or V2 I'm going with voodoo

121
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,143
X video oh so I'm going with V2

122
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
So

123
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,703
Voodoo or video

124
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
Raised 32 million in

125
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:05,407
Second-round financing and this is a company that does iot device security at the embedded

126
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
And I actually wrote about them

127
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
Probably a year ago

128
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
They want to do two things

129
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,575
I want to make it really easy for every device

130
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Sneaker

131
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,647
To get security on their devices

132
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,695
And they want to make it really easy to

133
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,047
The way they do this is they're trying to create this database of device types

134
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,887
Vulnerabilities and best practices associated with each device

135
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,959
It's doing this on its own without

136
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,263
Work from the companies for building devices

137
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,359
So it's trying to extract this information from websites from

138
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
Various

139
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
LPS

140
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,247
And then it's trying to use AI to assign rules to

141
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Taxo

142
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,927
If it's an HVAC controller for example it's going to say hey in HVAC controller should never talk to any website

143
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
Except for the manufacture

144
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,559
So if it sees anything outside of those rules your behavior outside of those

145
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
It won't let it

146
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Happen

147
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
What's

148
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,983
Exciting here is it doing that automatically Sono it person has to sit down

149
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
Figure out every device on the network

150
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
And figure out rules for the

151
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:10,431
This is like an AI kind of play almost ASU said like identify the

152
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,991
Potential threats of a device-level

153
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,575
And also some big data analysis from what I gather because

154
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,159
What they've done is they've a dataset of 70 million

155
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,695
Embedded system binaries

156
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,791
So walked between the firmware and the software that run on devices

157
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
And

158
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
According to them

159
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
This is true or not but doing less

160
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
18 months they say

161
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
That they've helped mitigate

162
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,055
Total of 150 zero-day vulnerabilities

163
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,383
And more than 100000 security issues on

164
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
A large number of devices so

165
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,527
Yeah if you had to do this company by company or device by device on your own

166
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,575
It would probably take forever they're just

167
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,647
Looking at the whole market and try to figure out where they can

168
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
Add value by scanning these things in advance

169
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
It's a pretty cool

170
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:02,143
System they also have a test lab so when they see devices they run them in their test lab and they actually

171
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,519
Run them on what is essentially open networks and they see what kind of vulnerabilities and attacks

172
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
Hit these devices

173
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
And then they let the manufacturer

174
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
No

175
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
So is it

176
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,967
How to fold Microsoft actually has one of these they have a

177
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,807
I think it is a Honeypot lab but they have a formal night

178
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:25,439
Yeah I don't know the name of that interesting I just realized these folks are based in Tel Aviv

179
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
They are

180
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,279
Call the good iot security firms for piston

181
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,095
Did somewhere in Israel and they all have peoples in the IDF

182
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Because

183
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
Man your IDF training

184
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
Apparently

185
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Good stuff right

186
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,567
Okay and one more industrial Enterprise E I O T story of VMware

187
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,919
They have released their second version of their pulse iot Platte

188
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,735
This is a platform that does a lot of stuff

189
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,527
This is for companies who want

190
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
Device management

191
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,391
They want to integrate their devices and applications for the

192
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
The edge

193
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
To the cloud

194
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,999
Feels like I'm saying a lot of jargon here but these are

195
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
Kind of crucial things that

196
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Have

197
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,143
They also do Edge device lifecycle management

198
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,167
Which means like

199
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
All these things at the edge

200
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,775
I need to know what they are you need to be able to say

201
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,359
Hey this is the software version running on them roll that back

202
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
If you have an update

203
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
All of that

204
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Is what this song

205
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
Scary

206
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,879
Yeah device management platform I mean that over the air updates support container management there's that word again

207
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Containers

208
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,951
Alerts and notifications so

209
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
This is kind of your

210
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,559
Platform management system for iot devices

211
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
Moe's at the edge I presume

212
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:41,471
It's both of the edge and in the cloud is basically what you're going to do is if you have

213
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:47,871
Iot devices and an application that's pulling for these devices it lets you see

214
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,687
The infrastructure associated with that apple

215
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Application in

216
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
Absolutely make sense

217
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,343
I know they're competing platforms that do similar things

218
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,159
Microsoft Google and Amazon so

219
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
Throw your hat in the ring VMware I love it

220
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,279
This is for people who are doing things on premise

221
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:11,679
You probably can do this I know that VMware has deals with AWS and I believe with Microsoft

222
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
What's I'm unclear as to how

223
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Deeply you could

224
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,567
Integrate with their systems are on their clouds

225
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
With us but

226
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
Just more tools out there for the

227
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
Shirley Caesar and

228
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:27,295
Let's talk about the smart home for a little bit we've got Amazon

229
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
He

230
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,135
You guys are probably familiar with this program

231
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,439
Don't need a lot of people who have it implemented

232
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,743
But what it does is the Amazon Key Program

233
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
Let's

234
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Amazon

235
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:42,143
Packages be delivered inside your house if you have certain door locks

236
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
Camera for your car

237
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
Now it's expanding to

238
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,615
Your car rise thanks to a deal that we talked about

239
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,175
Before with Chamberlain and it's my cue

240
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Platform

241
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,295
I wonder how many people's garages are clean enough to leave up

242
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,391
I'm so upset you guys cuz I pooped out

243
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Literally

244
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
Literally on Monday

245
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
And this news came out on Tuesday

246
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
And the ability to test it out

247
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,071
Came out then two

248
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:17,471
So I couldn't test out this functionality but I think it's probably going to be super appealing to a lot of people

249
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,055
Who didn't want to let an Amazon delivery person inside their house

250
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
But letting someone inside

251
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,895
Garages usually lower

252
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:31,295
Right right because typically you'll have an interior door to your garage from your home and most people I think we keep that locked

253
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,599
A lot of people don't actually lock it

254
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
I just called into slippers Amazon

255
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,439
Let those Amazon people in the house

256
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
You could start locking

257
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
Or you could have her

258
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,119
An automatic lock that you can remotely lock When You're Expecting Amazon

259
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
But

260
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,007
I like this idea I like the idea of letting someone

261
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,311
My garage the nice thing about the Chamberlain is it

262
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,639
Amazon person forgets to close the garage which they shouldn't be

263
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Because there's going to be

264
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Integration

265
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
Their stuff that says they closed it

266
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,063
But if they haven't the Chamberlain thing will actually let you

267
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
Angie.

268
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
Amazon

269
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,743
Should add as a service for this the ability to say

270
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
When the package is

271
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,863
Asteria meaning it's about to be delivered to my house

272
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Make sure that my garage door

273
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,471
The interior door is locked if it's not lock it

274
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
I like it

275
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
Okay

276
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
And speaking of doors

277
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Arlo

278
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,967
Is going to the front door

279
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:38,623
They're going to release a video doorbell according to Dave Zach's from

280
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
Zatznotfunny

281
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,975
Tom harbin

282
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
Are you excited about an hour

283
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
Well I don't really use

284
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,935
Any Arlo products and as I look at this it kind of looks like the nest

285
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
To me which is what I do use

286
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
So

287
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,847
I'm not in the market for one but if I was I would be interested in this yes

288
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
I'm kind of like

289
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
Why does everyone need a video doorbell

290
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,503
The market is totally saturated like how many options

291
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,879
Well you could say the same about webcams you can say the same night

292
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
Oh I will

293
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
It's not out yet

294
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,047
This is still theoretical

295
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,631
We should talk about our Lotus briefly because it is now

296
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,959
Publicly traded companies so it makes sense that they have to

297
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,263
Expand their product line Beyond cameras

298
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,103
And that's why it exists quite frankly it doesn't do anything differently it's

299
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,431
Snow 2 megapixel camera full HD video quality

300
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:40,319
I watch you love you two way audio etcetera so it's no different than anything else on the market but

301
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
You're right they have to expand the product line

302
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
And we have pricing on this

303
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,999
We do not we have basically a photo screenshot of the doorbell

304
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
As well as a

305
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,375
Marketing piece that shows the suite of products including the doorbell

306
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,727
Price might be the differentiator although it's not in the Arlo cameras which are high quality

307
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
Price commensurate with

308
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Quality

309
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
We'll just see

310
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,663
If you're in the market for a video doorbell and you've already got Arlo gear

311
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
This probably would make a lot of sense to buy

312
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:13,599
Although if you're in the market for a video doorbell and you have a Google Assistant I would steer you to the nest

313
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
And if you had Amazon

314
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,439
Deeply embedded in your life I would still YouTube

315
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
So I'm kind of like

316
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Yeah

317
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
Pick your platform

318
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,863
Pick your platform and will Arlo make it as a platform

319
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Big shrug

320
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
Alright let's have a drone delivery

321
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,239
Garage delivery

322
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
Drone delivery

323
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
This package will come down your chimney

324
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,967
Now I really want probably could manage that but I don't think you want that

325
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
What's interesting about this and we're talking about

326
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,599
The FAA has now allowed work given

327
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
Certification

328
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,927
US air carrier certification

329
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,743
Two alphabets Wing Aviation unit

330
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Which is the part that does the drones

331
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,351
I did not realize that they would need

332
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,447
Air carrier certification for this it's rather interesting that they did

333
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
And now they have it

334
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,775
When can I start

335
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Delivering

336
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
2 homes

337
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,871
Whatever price you were there supporting

338
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
So what is air carrier

339
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
Ignition status

340
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:18,111
That's the interesting thing to me it kind of means they have to follow the same rules and regulations as traditional aircraft

341
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,743
A drone is not a planet does not passengers and so on so I'm not

342
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,815
Quite sure that's why I was surprised he needed the air

343
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
Carrier designation here

344
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,911
Well I mean planes carry cargo

345
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
Sometimes I mean like FedEx in

346
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
UPS hub

347
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
Athleta cargo plane

348
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,895
I assume I I just look like one of the rules associated

349
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
I don't know

350
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,479
Yeah that I do not know I mean

351
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
The question

352
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,575
The certifications good for two years I know that much

353
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
And this was interesting as well

354
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,463
One Pilot obviously not a pilot inside the Drone was there really small

355
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,023
Can operate up to 5 phones at once

356
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
And only during the day as a result of the certification

357
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:05,983
That makes sense so I've been talking to people quite a bit about my driverless cars and tell operation

358
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,335
And idea that you'll have one person responsible for

359
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
And the people I've talked

360
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
They're doing

361
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
Commercial vehicle

362
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
Commercial truck

363
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Transport

364
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
They have

365
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
One person operating

366
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
10

367
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
Autonomous vehicles

368
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
And so

369
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
It's kind of an interesting

370
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
This idea of like

371
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
How are we

372
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,303
Going to have these autonomous futures

373
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,375
And by how much can you reduce the human

374
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
Presents

375
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:40,287
Because basically we think of this is like the robots are taking over but what's really happening is the robot for help

376
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Happiness scale

377
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,871
And you saw this back in the day when we had

378
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
Servers Avenue used to be like

379
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
Way Back Inn

380
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,551
Backwood everyone had a server Closet in their office

381
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,391
Late 90s early aughts you had like one person can manage 5 to 10

382
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Cerberus basically

383
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,767
And then what has happened is now where to point where it

384
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,071
Google Amazon one person can manage

385
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
And

386
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:11,519
We're probably going to see something similar as our Automation and management gets better for

387
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
Autonomous vehicles

388
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
I would even say things like

389
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
Connected devices like right now in a

390
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,967
Building when you have a building management system

391
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,295
You might have one facilities person who manages

392
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
A floor

393
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,391
Connected devices usually it's broken down by the

394
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Types of pie

395
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,463
Alexa one person for the lighting platform on

396
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
Window platform

397
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
But

398
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,399
We often forget that there's this huge intermediate step in

399
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
Little intermittent

400
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,263
Leaps of progress we're basically just

401
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,055
Allowing one person to manage

402
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
And letting software

403
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Take over the rest

404
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,455
How many times we have that for the smart home because

405
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:56,063
You and I are probably the point people in our homes for the many dozens of devices that we have

406
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,343
But yeah

407
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
It's all about scalability

408
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
I totally agree with that

409
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,695
Yes we are evaluating

410
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
Things this is how I mean

411
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,023
Personally this is one of the ways I have value

412
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
News

413
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,351
Things just how I look at the world I'm like hey

414
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,727
How can that scale how many devices can one person now managed with this particular advice

415
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
You're not the only

416
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
It's a good one

417
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
It is what it is

418
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,895
Synthesis in the us obviously

419
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
During start deliveries in the US

420
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
Planning to start

421
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,551
Commercial package delivery in Blacksburg Virginia later this year

422
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,623
And Wing already does deliveries

423
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
And Australia

424
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,743
And I believe they're about to be in testing and Helsinki

425
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
It was just there

426
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
I know

427
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
You could order something by drone

428
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,215
That kind of makes up Helsinki Salo City

429
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
For what that's worth

430
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,359
It's a low City there's not a lot of skyscrapers so

431
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
I think there were like two or

432
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
3 and they were really skyscrapers they were like

433
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
20 story building

434
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
And they were more in Espanol

435
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Helsinki

436
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Okay

437
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,903
Stop saying that

438
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
All right

439
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Wise

440
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,047
Is beta testing Google Assistant integration

441
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:14,911
Man $30 and $20 cameras just

442
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Keep getting

443
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Better

444
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,519
So yeah release date like that

445
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,567
Timbre in the wise community

446
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,895
Site you can follow along with those who are beta testing

447
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,991
You may still be able to apply I'm not sure on that one but it's worth reading

448
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:33,087
What they did to testers are seeing their seeing some issues I mean that's what a beta test is

449
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,647
You know kind of weed those out get them fixed such as

450
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,463
Super long latency times on one person reported like a

451
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,999
15 second delay

452
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,839
Before they were actually able to see their camera on sale OK Google home

453
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,631
Humphreys amp over the phone

454
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:52,287
But they're getting there and that's important I've been watching for wise to add Google Assistant support as well as Sono switch

455
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,079
I know that was supposed to be out last year

456
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,871
Management perspective this year but

457
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
New news on the Sonos front

458
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
And I love the fact that we like

459
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
18

460
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
Second delay

461
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
Life is terrible

462
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,415
Well it means

463
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
It isn't real use case I just love how

464
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,791
How spoiled I was just going to say we're so spoiled

465
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,887
Like I remember when I would wait like a minute and a half for a webpage to live

466
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,775
That I had when you were on Roadrunner

467
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
All right

468
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,359
Also Google Assistant news we've got

469
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
Can call them skills

470
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,735
Integrations

471
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
Interactions routine

472
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
I think it's if does applets

473
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
Google dance routines

474
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
Animated skills

475
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,207
Amana Bay by the way is our version of

476
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
Amazon speaker

477
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Amazon stick

478
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Special Assistant

479
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
Okay

480
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
So

481
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
What can we do

482
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,655
We can do more with water

483
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,447
Water

484
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,239
So now you can integrate

485
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,591
Leak Detectors such as the leak smart or the Flow by Moen

486
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639
To get notifications

487
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
Your pipes leak

488
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,455
And you can even tell the assistant

489
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
Shut off your water

490
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,783
And also for you gardeners out there

491
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
Audi rsq3

492
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
Smart sprinkler controller

493
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
Is now available

494
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,951
To integrate with the Google Assistant

495
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,511
They're looking to they been Google

496
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,071
Adding support for the rain Birds

497
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,631
Irrigation controllers in the coming weeks as well

498
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
Exciting

499
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,727
So this is kind of an earth day thing talk about

500
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
Hey

501
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,127
Save water so the flow system the Flow by Bowen

502
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,407
You don't have to have Moen

503
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,943
Pictures for this to work

504
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,527
Basically the flow system is a $500

505
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
Device

506
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
Thing that your water

507
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
Yeah I was like what is that thing but water mean

508
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
Water

509
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,743
So you can get this

510
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,583
At Home Depot and Amazon we've actually had the CEO of this company on

511
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
Podcast before

512
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
Gables lovely

513
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,935
But it will show you

514
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,263
What the what are you saying it to text things like slow leaks

515
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,543
Which is really important

516
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Because they're

517
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,615
Usually very hard to detect

518
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
Pipe bursting

519
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,199
Like water is raining down on you you're like

520
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
Oh yeah dude

521
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,039
So this allows you to turn off

522
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
Where is well

523
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:17,696
It's one of the less-expensive options out there some of the others are about $800

524
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
So

525
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
That's exciting

526
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
And

527
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,912
I think I'm going to install one of these when I get to a new house that I actually own which is going to be a while

528
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Very sad about that

529
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
But

530
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
I

531
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:35,872
I think this is the sort of thing that makes a lot of sense if you have the income in

532
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
Want to focus on

533
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,456
I habitat

534
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,272
Happy, I want to focus on prevention here so I like

535
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,832
I also like the idea of like

536
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,112
What a prank you could have

537
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
Haji

538
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Turn off the water

539
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,976
When somebody's in the shower

540
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,024
Oh that's so bad

541
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
See this is why we need

542
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
Admin privileges

543
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,144
Yes I agree

544
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
I agree

545
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
I am terrible no one would ever

546
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
All right

547
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
What's in the news portion on

548
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,848
An exciting bit of news that I found in

549
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,920
I have a husband who is allergic to fire ants

550
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
And so we used to

551
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,296
In college together we'd go out places with our friends and

552
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:20,160
Fight places to wear Outdoors over who would have to inject his EpiPen

553
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
If he got bit by a fire ant

554
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
Count me out

555
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Yeah

556
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
We rise like Madden

557
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,632
Now that he's my husband I totally would.

558
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
Bananas fiber

559
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Right

560
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,288
So the folks at Rice University

561
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
I built a prototype

562
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
Device that you

563
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
Where on your wrist

564
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,968
And it does the injection for you so you press this button and

565
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,296
Can you inject epinephrine into someone's system so this is

566
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
For children

567
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,880
Mostly or but it could have been for my

568
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,160
My husband back in the day

569
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
You're so squeamish

570
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,744
And this is not something you can buy yet

571
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,816
But it is really exciting I think

572
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,864
That you have this device that you

573
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,192
You can wear around your wrist very clunky and you just press this button is like

574
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,544
It's a smart app rotates a little bulky obviously this is a prototype

575
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,104
But this is fantastic not connected I could

576
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,664
I'd like to see somebody get out

577
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:17,248
People hit like that panic button on their phone or watch to be able to

578
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:22,624
Have it automatically inject if it detects whatever needs to be detected I don't know

579
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,416
Can before you go into

580
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,232
Anaphylactic shock there must be some way to detect that

581
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,304
I also wonder if this ever comes to Market if it

582
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,584
Piers in

583
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,656
What's a combat uniforms or gear

584
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,704
Oh that's really interesting

585
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,264
Yeah you could like give your soldier a burst of

586
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Yeah

587
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
Here's your adrenaline shot get up Soldier

588
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
Wow

589
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
The same size

590
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,760
Cuz that's totally built it as a built-in feature in all of the lake

591
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Space suit

592
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
Combat suits

593
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,368
Yeah, batsuits Bae Suzy and I

594
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,952
I'm building my own for the zombie apocalypse I think they'll include this

595
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:04,352
Yeah get that in there so we'll look in here for this it's obviously still a prototype really interesting

596
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,144
Plus it's from one of my favorite sites

597
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
Medgadget

598
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,472
Is just as awesome site

599
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,008
If you're interested in health

600
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,544
And Technology

601
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
Can I plug it enough

602
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
Just love it

603
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,664
So that's how about it for news this week

604
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
I will tell you guys next week

605
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
All about

606
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:25,088
My smart home moving Adventures since I'm now officially out of my house in

607
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,136
I temporarily

608
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:30,464
Temporarily temporarily officially out of one house into a

609
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
Apartment

610
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
Where I'm not installing anything

611
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,816
Well actually I am so I'll tell you about that

612
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,400
And now it is time for The Internet of Things podcast

613
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,424
Hotline

614
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,008
We have a wonderful voice mail asking about sensors

615
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
The podcast

616
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,848
Hotline is sponsored by a pharaoh

617
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,456
With the fifth largest iot patent portfolio in the world afero provides a

618
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,040
Iproven iot platform that doesn't risk your brand

619
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:01,696
Apeiro customers have experienced as much as an 80% reduction in time-to-market and tenex higher activation

620
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
You

621
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,024
Can learn more at a pharaoh

622
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
Dot IO

623
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,120
So this week's voicemail is from

Next. IO alarm system

628
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
The ties into

629
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Your existing

630
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
Wired alarm system

631
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,968
And connect via SmartThings

632
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,272
This kind of nerdy DIY project

633
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,064
But I know you guys are out there

634
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832

We'd love to hear from you

644
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
Alright this week's voicemail is from

645
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
Json

646
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,776
IStation Kevin this is JC

647
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,128
I've been automating my home but I'm

648
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
I was wondering

649
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,224
You could recommend

650
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,016
A sensor to put in each

651
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
Set monitor sings like

652
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
Humidity motion and Light

653
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,672
I don't currently have a hub

654
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,976
But that isn't ever the question

655
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
Your suggestions would be helped

656
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,632
Jason I'm so glad you asked this question because now I can tell you about my

657
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
Spirit Center

658
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
In like the whole wide world

659
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
I'm not kidding

660
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
You guys this is the aeotec

661
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,288
Multisensor 6

662
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
I

663
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
Love this

664
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
Pretty

665
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Dysfunctional

666
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
And you can actually install it

667
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
Recessed

668
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,248
So it's not even like super visible

669
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,040
Catches

670
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,064
It is expensive

671
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,600
It's about 60 bucks

672
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,672
But for all of that you get a motion sensor

673
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,696
A temperature sensor

674
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,720
A light sensor

675
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
Humidity sensor

676
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,560
A vibration sensor and

677
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
A UV sensor

678
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
All of that is

679
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:49,728
Pretty freaking awesome and I will tell you having tested the sensor out

680
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
It is very accurate

681
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
And

682
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
Latency is

683
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Greeley

684
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
Low on

685
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,432
The SmartThings platform which is what I tried it up again

686
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,016
So this is a Z-Wave sensor you will need

687
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Hub with

688
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
I would recommend SmartThings

689
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:10,464
The Furious stuff works well with it works well with openhab home assistant

690
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
Lots of other products

691
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
So

692
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,328
Yeah there are some other alternatives

693
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:20,960
On the market for Barro's motion sensors also the same price range about $60

694
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,800
It's lacking humidity if I recall correctly so

695
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,616
Obviously at the same price I probably go with

696
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,896
Aerotek

697
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
Stacey recommended

698
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:35,808
$60 per room kinetic quickly so I only mention this with a caveat

699
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,368
Monoprice makes a Z-Wave Plus

700
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,696
Sensor for motion temperature humidity and Light

701
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,744
It's only $30

702
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
However

703
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:51,680
Most of the reviews on Amazon where you can purchase it for $30 are in the negative category so

704
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:56,800
Treme I probably spend $90 and get one of each the Monoprice in the Aerotek

705
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
You can always return the one that's

706
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
Not working well for you and then

707
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,200
Equip all of the rooms at the one that does work best for you

708
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,528
Yes and there's also a device from

709
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Zoos

710
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,344
Z o o z

711
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
That is

712
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
$33

713
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,720
This particular sensor only works with

714
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:18,560
Open system so the securifi almond

715
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,864
Which is popcorn we don't talk a lot about

716
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
What is a good platform

717
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,496
Home assistant habitat SmartThings you are going to need a custom device Handler

718
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Murphy's on Spa

719
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,800
Thanks lots of options

720
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
Lots of options

721
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,640
Yay go sensor it up

722
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
And actually

723
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
Let us know what you think

724
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
We always love feedback

725
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:40,320
So in terms of like hate this works really well for being this case but not really well in that

726
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,392

00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,728
Who is the director of solution

744
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,800
Texture for iot and analytics at software AG

745
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
Hi John how are you doing

746
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,896
Hey Stacey great to be here thanks for having

747
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:41,248
All right we'll John we talked about Edge robotics what to do with data and a

748
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,296
A lot more so far in the series

749
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,624
This week we're going to talk about software AG being

750
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
Open an

751
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
But first

752
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,464
What's reminder audience

753
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,512
What it is that software AG does

754
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,304
And what it has to offer the io

755
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,912
Software AG has been an Innovative software company

756
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,192
50 years

757
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,496
We're global company headquartered in Germany

758
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:08,384
And 70% of Fortune 1000 companies use our Solutions we're best known for our integration in

759
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
Business process and

760
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,200
Of course iot

761
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
And Analytics

762
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,808
Specifically

763
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,880
We have a platform called cumulus City Iowa

764
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,184
Which is a very highly ranked

765
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
Open

766
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
Independent platform that does

767
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,304
Everything from managing devices to

768
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
Condition-based monitoring

769
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,120
Predictive Analytics

770
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,400
And everything in between

771
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
Best of all

772
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,216
You can get up and running in a matter of

773
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
Minutes

774
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
Not weeks

775
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,776
Not much

776
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,312
Using our intuitive

777
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,592
Drag and drop interface

778
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
At available s

779
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
Nice

780
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,248
All right so companies use the phrase open and independent

781
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
A lot

782
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,296
What do you guys mean

783
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
Buy open

784
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,648
Buy open I mean the whole platform is a

785
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,440
Accessible via secure API

786
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,232
Which allow you to interface

787
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,000
Chewy

788
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,280
From other Solutions

789
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,840
As well as completely Taylor VII

790
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,120
Platform to your name

791
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,192
This what you access your data anywhere anytime

792
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
Buy

793
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,008
I mean we are one of the

794
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
Only vendor

795
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,336
They can take the same code base

796
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,872
And run it anywhere

797
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,664
At the edge on Prim

798
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688
In a data center

799
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
Private cloud

800
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
Public cloud

801
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,016
The possibilities are

802
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:22,880
Endless we have customers running the platform in AWS Azure Alibaba

803
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,184
And a private data centers all over the

804
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
This flexibility

805
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,024
Gives you the freedom to choose your own desk

806
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
You decide

807
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,840
Where do you host Your solution

808
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,632
And how your data is stored

809
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,936
If your plans change and you decided

810
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,984
Remove

811
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
Cantu

812
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
That sounds excellent

813
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,616
So where can I go to find out more about software AG

814
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
And

815
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Camila sodi

816
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,712
You can go to software AG

817
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:53,344
Dot-com iot now to start your free no commitment trial today

818
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:04,352
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host and today's guest

819
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
Is Danny Fong

820
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,936
Who is a postdoc fellow

821
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:08,960
@prince

822
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
Stemscopes Ida paw

823
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
So

824
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
He's probably

825
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,336
How are you doing

826
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,384
Hi Stacy

827
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,200
Me and I am so excited to have you on the show

828
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:25,088
You were part of a team that released something just a few weeks ago called iot inspector

829
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,648
That allows me to run this program on Micah

830
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,720
And then see what devices are on my network

831
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:35,328
We're going to try my best day so let's kick it off with why the heck did you guys built this

832
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,984
Demolition started in November last year Thanksgiving when a few friends of mine receive

833
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,288
Need the number of iot devices asked

834
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,080
Presents and they're like

835
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,896
Should we use these iot

836
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,920
And they knew that I

837
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,480
And I was doing iot research

838
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:57,856
Is there a way for us to figure out if he's i'll devices are easy to use

839
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:01,440
Like one way is to send those devices to Denny's

840
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,000
Danny's colonies in the lab and analyze

841
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:07,584
Play some but either way so that was struggling motivation

842
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
How we started

843
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,936
Doing this project the whole goal is to make it

844
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
Super easy for an average

845
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,752
Consumer

846
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:19,104
To check if their iot devices are safe or not

847
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
In their home

848
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,664
Or you know before

849
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,992
They decide to return their products back to Amazon or something

850
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
Whether they should keep using it

851
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,808
Sebastian motivation

852
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
I guess run average

853
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:32,416
Consumer it is very difficult for them to do what we do in the lab

854
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,232
Such a setting up a wireless network with running

855
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,792
Wireshark and analyze the traffic

856
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
So we decided that

857
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
On average

858
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
Consumer we need a

859
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,448
Do them something simple something clickable

860
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:50,080
That they can use almost instantaneously to figure out if they're iot devices

861
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,104
Are trustworthy

862
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,128
Sabattus

863
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
How we started this project

864
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,992
Okay so if the goal is to figure out

865
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,808
If these devices are safe to use and run

866
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,344
How are you guys measuring

867
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
What are the things you're looking

868
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
Coyote NC

869
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,720
To help our users determine if

870
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,256
A particular iot device

871
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
Inspector

872
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:14,144
Shows visualization that answers to Broad question

873
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,680
The first question is

874
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
Are my devices

875
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,496
Talkin to the internet

876
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
When they're not supposed

877
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,336
And a second question is

878
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,408
To whom were my iot devices talking

879
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,992
Occiput first point we have visualization

880
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,296
Such as a graph that shows

881
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,344
At what time your devices

882
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,160
We're talkin sending and receiving traffic

883
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,976
Say for instance we have a camera in the lab

884
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,280
We could see that when we're using it

885
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,816
Now we can see spikes

886
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,608
In the bed with the consumer

887
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
Overtime

888
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:49,216
When it's not being used obviously there should not be any traffic

889
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Received

890
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,800
Another instance is we have an Amazon Echo

891
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,616
In our lab as well we ran I'll Constructor

892
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,152
Analyze the echo

893
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,712
You found that there's constant

894
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,552
Stream of traffic being received and sent by Amazon Echo

895
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,624
Presumably it while the Amazon Echo was

896
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,160
Contacting the server

897
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,184
Maybe for Harvey

898
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Kings or something

899
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,000
That's one classic question

900
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,280
Thataylaa Construction

901
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,096
Answer the second question is

902
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,656
I to whom my devices were talking to

903
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,984
Show at the answer this question I expect a present

904
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Cables

905
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,288
In points

906
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,104
Dad go devices were talking to buy in points

907
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
I meant

908
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,920
What is the name of the server what is it

909
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,736
IP address what country is what type of

910
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Server

911
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
Your devices

912
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,624
Say for instance we have a smart TV or Roku Smart TV

913
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,464
Money started that watching say Princeton's Bloomberg live news

914
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,792
We could see that the TV was talking to

915
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,608
Not only bloomberg.com but also

916
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,168
Video hosting Services run by Google

917
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:56,544
As well as a number of advertising or tracking services such as Google Analytics

918
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:02,432
This table will allow us to visualize exactly

919
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
Which

920
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
Parties for a contact

921
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,784
These could be first parties

922
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,576
In this case of fire

923
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,856
Boombah.com

924
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,648
Could be start party

925
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,000
Team is case you could be the advertising services such as school Analytics

926
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,024
Got it

927
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,328
So I haven't used it those are somewhat

928
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,400
I think the fact that some devices do

929
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,472
Like share State information so there's kind of a their heart

930
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
Ping or maybe

931
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,568
Connected devices that are connected to other devices have some sort

932
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
Back-channel

933
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
Communication

934
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,200
And there's things like overnight updates like sometimes my devices when I'm not using them

935
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
Arsenic

936
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,784
Lot of traffic which can look a little weird

937
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
You're like oh

938
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,832
That's what that

939
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,648
I love having the visibility into that

940
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,464
I do think it's important to understand like

941
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,864
What's happening on the back end and I'm curious how do you think device makers should communicate

942
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
Both on Howell

943
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,704
Often their devices are communicating to the network

944
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,240
And then we're there

945
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
Communicating

946
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
In the current setting

947
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:07,200
Some smart TVs made her such as Roku and Amazon would say that in their privacy policies

948
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
Especially

949
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:11,040
Bad the devices contacts

950
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
Hardee's

951
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,112
So if consumers

952
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:18,976
Read these privacy policies carefully it should not be a surprising

953
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
Facts that their TVs

954
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,864
We're talking to a range of third-party services

955
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,912
That is state right now for Smart TV

956
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,240
Stay right now for non-smart TV such

957
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,032
Hive smart plugs

958
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:37,664
Is little unclear so one example is we have a smart plug a WeMo plug and some people

959
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,688
It was

960
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,736
Talking to

961
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,528
Some third-party iot

962
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Control service

963
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,928
That would allow a user to turn on and off the switch remotely is not clear

964
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,464
A user

965
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,864
That when they bought the product from Amazon it is not clear the user with know that they're smart plug with top

966
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,704
Talk to a service other than the manufacturer in bloom cell

967
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
Status of current state

968
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,776
In terms of

969
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:07,360
Question about what we think I should do

970
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,944
I definitely believe that there should be more transparency and privacy

971
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
Policy

972
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:20,672
How to say thatto your product will talk to these third parties where you know he's sure that you'll be some constant stream of coming

973
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
Location

974
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,512
But in reality I'm not sure how

975
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,536
Weather that would help

976
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
For two reasons

977
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,096
The first reason is sad

978
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,192
I don't know if they haven't sent it for saying something like that in other words

979
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:38,080
If a vendor says that your smart plug will be talking to an iot control strawberry such as tuya in China

980
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,616
Pc-1 example

981
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,640
Thinking out loud

982
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,736
I don't know how consumers would take that and that might reduce number of sales

983
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
Tessa Brooks recent

984
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
Second reasons.

985
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,832
I'm not sure if

986
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,112
Many consumers

987
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,928
Understand what that means I am with you

988
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,232
Both of those reasons are excellent reason

989
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
And I think

990
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,048
There's a lack of vendor

991
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,608
Desire to do this because it could hurt sales

992
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,912
We're sending your data to some place

993
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
Chinese platform

994
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,960
Provider you know some

995
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
Even though it

996
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
It's totally the

997
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,312
Other vendors

998
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,920
Right inside the traffic was talking about me not be like

999
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,224
Any private information this could be just

1000
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,016
Someone turning on and off switch

1001
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:22,880
And I'm too someone to consume

1002
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,160
They may just freaked out

1003
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,768
But there's also the need to educate the overall Market about

1004
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,560
What is problematic Behavior

1005
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
What isn't

1006
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,400
So let's go and do something else at this tracks which is

1007
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,936
Poor encryption or weekend

1008
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
And I believe there

1009
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,288
Three things that I can see I can see devices with

1010
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,080
No sort of security on them

1011
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,872
Weak encryption and

1012
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,896
Insecure

1013
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
Practices

1014
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,688
In terms of

1015
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:49,760
Security of neutralization we show

1016
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,576
Instances of no encryption

1017
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:58,720
Secure encryption or we can cryption those can be very confusing labels and we are still working on the way to

1018
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:03,072
Fine-tune those labels that's what these labels mean is the following

1019
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,352
No encryption

1020
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
Meaning

1021
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,192
A device is talking to the server using

1022
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:08,960
In this case

1023
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,752
Http unencrypted

1024
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
480

1025
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,080
We've seen lots of instances of those

1026
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,616
We don't know if

1027
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,664
Devices were actually sending

1028
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,760
Sensitive information to the clouds or not we don't have the data but it is

1029
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,784
Away

1030
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,576
Rest assured that all your devices

1031
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
Talking to the cloud without encryption

1032
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
This is actually pretty common

1033
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,952
Even happens on

1034
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,976
My phone sometime

1035
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,792
Android pixel 2

1036
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,096
I sometimes talk to the clouds without encryption

1037
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,144
Sometimes you just to test working City

1038
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,424
Status no encryption

1039
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,472
Insecure encryption

1040
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,008
The very bad case

1041
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,848
So when Taliban cryption their various encryption methods

1042
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
The most

1043
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:51,712
The industry-standard today is this encryption card TLS 1.0

1044
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,808
In supposed to be secure and it's difficult to break

1045
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,600
But they're still exist

1046
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,624
Outdated ink

1047
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,696
Encryption methods such as TLS 1.0

1048
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,232
Depression that predates

1049
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,768
Current at 1.2

1050
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,072
Researchers have found ways to

1051
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:12,704
Sportpaleis 1.0 such that if your device is running on July 2108 encryption

1052
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,544
There's a potentially a hacker May intercept your traffic

1053
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,336
Extract

1054
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:23,456
Potentially sensitive information in your Indian communication

1055
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
Because he is well known that he

1056
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
Insecure yet

1057
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,552
We still

1058
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,576
See

1059
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,624
A small number of devices

1060
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
Whisk LS1

1061
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,208
10 being used in the encryption

1062
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,256
I am not going to say what company

1063
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,584
Some major company that makes Smart TVs

1064
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
In fact

1065
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,960
We talked to one of their customer representative

1066
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,288
And ask if their devices used

1067
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,080
State-of-the-art encryption

1068
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,407
Their customer rap say something long line of yes we all in

1069
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,271
One of the TV channels

1070
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,087
We communicate with the cloud using TLS 1.0

1071
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
Oh so they're actively lying

1072
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
So not cool

1073
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,047
Actually is aware of what's going on

1074
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,839
You're right you are a much nicer

1075
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,887
Alright so that's insecure

1076
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,935
And then week is

1077
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,519
If you show the devices using Beacon

1078
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,079
It means that a device

1079
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,103
Support

1080
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
Weak ciphers

1081
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,943
It doesn't necessarily mean that they are asked

1082
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,807
Free using we Cipher Suites in their last communication always saying is that these devices

1083
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
So

1084
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,135
In a case

1085
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,183
Where a server actually

1086
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,487
Yes using weak Cipher Suites

1087
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,023
The entire communication

1088
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,303
Will be using weeks

1089
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,631
Always saying that if we label device

1090
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,959
Add honey wheat encryption the device supports weeks

1091
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,007
There are way more devices

1092
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,543
With weak encryption

1093
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,823
I'm insecure encryption

1094
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
I don't know why

1095
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,919
Potentially devices with weak encryption

1096
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,967
That is devices with weak Cipher Suites

1097
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,807
Could be a because of backward compatibility but don't know why

1098
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:09,695
But it may not be as bad as insecure encryption that is pieces using TLS 1.0

1099
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
Okay

1100
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,999
So it's kind of like

1101
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,559
If I send my daughter to school with

1102
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
Lunch money

1103
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,423
She may go to the cookie stand or she make it a chicken sandwich

1104
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,239
But both are on offer in with her money she could buy both

1105
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,799
Are either and so I don't actually know if she's

1106
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,407
That is correct that is a very good analogy

1107
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,735
So that explains kind of what you guys are measuring

1108
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,807
Let's talk about how companies have reacted

1109
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,599
That's because now it's been in the market

1110
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,391
Kit for a while you guys have been testing

1111
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
Before it was you

1112
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,439
At least

1113
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:45,279
Are you talking to some of the vendors at these devices are there reaching out in the saying

1114
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,815
Hey

1115
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:50,399
There's an issue or maybe even offering more clarity I know that sometimes when

1116
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,471
I'm looking at some of the places my thing is talking to him like

1117
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,543
I take that belongs to the company but I don't know

1118
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,847
We have actually not talk to you any

1119
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,407
For some reason I just talked about like

1120
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,455
Devices that use TLS 1.0

1121
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,759
We have not reached out

1122
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,295
Company say that old

1123
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,879
Your devices are not our talking 1.0 we are

1124
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,695
Time to do that once we gather more concrete evidence

1125
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
Got it

1126
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,023
So let's talk about actually

1127
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,559
What you guys are doing with this

1128
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,607
That's cuz there's a couple caveat by thinker

1129
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,631
Importance for people in

1130
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,911
1 is

1131
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,471
The data you guys are gathering is for research for

1132
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,239
Purposes

1133
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,031
It's possible for me to delete it

1134
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,079
But you probably would rather I didn't tell you

1135
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,359
Look at it is that

1136
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,151
I mean I know you're analyzing

1137
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:33,919
In the state of

1138
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,503
Congratulation

1139
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,527
That is correct

1140
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,343
We'd rather you not delete it but we give you the option

1141
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,671
To easily be today like you want to say Frances

1142
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,231
You accidentally capture a sensitive data

1143
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:51,327
From a sensitive device always together

1144
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,607
As much data

1145
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,887
As possible because

1146
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,935
So far there isn't

1147
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,471
We haven't seen any

1148
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,519
Non-proprietary death

1149
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,591
Coyote research Community to look into

1150
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,919
Ashley security privacy problems

1151
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
We want to be the first

1152
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,247
Studio session label

1153
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,319
Where individual devices word labeled

1154
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,599
Buy users

1155
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,391
So that we know exactly

1156
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
Which

1157
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,183
Device

1158
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,719
What type of device

1159
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
Off this device

1160
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,535
Was sending what kind of traffic

1161
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,887
And there's also the issue that this has to run on

1162
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,167
Computer

1163
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,215
Fairly constantly

1164
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:29,983
Yes

1165
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:30,751
To get the data

1166
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
Installed

1167
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,847
Actually you don't need to run this offer constant

1168
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,407
You can run this for however however long you like

1169
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
Just look at the data right now

1170
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,247
7 days

1171
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,783
In a medium case

1172
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,831
Users running ourselves

1173
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
17 minutes

1174
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,927
Presumably to scan their Network

1175
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,719
See what devices are network

1176
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,559
Just have a brief overview of whom their devices were talking to

1177
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,119
Although we have a very long tail love you

1178
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:00,447
Startran this offer for as long as ours

1179
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
Hours

1180
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,519
So we can receive a variety of use

1181
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,847
Encases people ran this offer for 17 minutes

1182
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,431
Okay and do they refund it or do they

1183
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,711
Just run it once in

1184
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,247
Check it out and then move on

1185
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,783
Bible said that's a good question

1186
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
Okay

1187
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,111
And this is tracking my traffic on my

1188
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
Mywifi net

1189
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,439
This is tracking

1190
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,463
The traffic

1191
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,743
Of devices

1192
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,303
A Wi-Fi network that you exist

1193
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,839
Explicitly wanted monitor

1194
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,863
Right I do have to

1195
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
Check the

1196
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,959
What is an option model

1197
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,007
So it's not going to pick up my like

1198
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:38,079
Weird zigbee things are Bluetooth things unless they talk back

1199
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,919
That is correct inspector only looks at the

1200
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,687
Wi-Fi

1201
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,479
Should I expect Network

1202
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
Congestion

1203
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,295
Yes you will

1204
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,855
In fact the way this offer work sister

1205
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,623
It does Arby's

1206
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,415
To intercept the network

1207
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,207
Traffic what does it mean to stat

1208
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,999
Let's say that you're watching

1209
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,023
A smart TV

1210
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,583
And normally your smart TV will be talkin trapeze

1211
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,423
Router but with respect to running your smart TV traffic

1212
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
Spurs

1213
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,471
Go to the router

1214
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,799
Rather for the traffic to your computer running

1215
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,359
I need a computer for traffic back to the router

1216
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,151
Before the traffic goes back to the internet

1217
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:17,503
NYC / so you can see that there's extra packets being sent or received in the air

1218
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,807
Absolutely airwave Esprit muschamp

1219
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,831
With twice

1220
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,855
Amount of traffic

1221
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,159
Our case we've experienced

1222
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:24,927
Reduced

1223
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:28,511
Network quality especially if you're on a home network that is slow

1224
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,791
That's one of the risks

1225
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,327
I'll running out in Spanish

1226
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,679
Is you get the greatest Network appointments although in my own experience

1227
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:40,543
I have not seen any significant degradation like I can still watch TV on normally

1228
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:45,407
Maybe sometimes see the image quality made a little bit blurry but I can still watch TV

1229
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,687
Okay

1230
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:51,807
SI I didn't notice any problems but this is another reason that maybe you want to run it and then shut it down

1231
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,111
I've been having done this in

1232
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,903
I know it hasn't been out super long

1233
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,719
What are your takeaways so far

1234
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,559
Have you changed your friends Minds do they want to return their products are they okay

1235
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,119
I see one of my friends

1236
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,447
Smart plug that send information to China every 5 Seconds

1237
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,727
He was not happy about it

1238
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,847
I'm not sure whether he is going to send send it back to Amazon but he was not happy about

1239
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
Tupac talking to China

1240
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:23,039
A lot of companies use Chinese platforms because they are cheaper or sometimes devices from

1241
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:29,183
China are cheaper and people tend to vote with their wallets and so far consumers are not willing to spend more money

1242
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,975
On something that

1243
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,511
Maybe doesn't have an affiliation

1244
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,559
Is that something

1245
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:38,911
That you think might change as we publicize the results of your research

1246
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,239
That's probably be pragmatic kind and that's probably be anal

1247
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,799
I tend to fall into the pragmatic kind

1248
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,079
I don't care

1249
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:51,711
Who my devices talking to As Long As I believe that there's no personal information being lost

1250
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,991
So I'm probably fine

1251
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,783
When using smart plug

1252
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,575
That talks to Sage we are

1253
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,599
By the way yes

1254
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,623
My smart plug

1255
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,647
Was talking

1256
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:05,279
A server is actually located in Amazon AWS

1257
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,351
My guess is that

1258
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,119
The traffic

1259
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
In this case

1260
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:13,215
It's mostly mqtt traffic or xmpp traffic

1261
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,007
Physically iot control traffic

1262
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:19,615
That is unlikely to have my name or other part of very personal information in it

1263
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,895
I most likely find

1264
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:26,015
On the other hand it's the kind that may not be comfortable

1265
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:30,623
As my smart plug is talking to China even though

1266
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:34,463
The communication isn't likely to include personal information

1267
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,999
Someone in

1268
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,279
Those companies

1269
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,839
May still infer my

1270
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
Living habits

1271
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:46,239
When I turn on turn off the switch or your when I get home

1272
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,543
Disinformation

1273
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,079
I'm also

1274
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,103
There's a smart TVs

1275
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,175
I'm constantly talk to Truckers

1276
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,223
The same way you would process web and then

1277
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,247
Your web pages

1278
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,039
Advertisement ads

1279
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,855
Salvini

1280
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,439
The other day it was still very difficult to take actions

1281
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,463
Because

1282
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,279
Tracking services are very

1283
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,303
How to block

1284
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,839
So here's why

1285
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,911
Weekly install say

1286
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,983
And then we would still be able to browse

1287
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,007
Google web pages

1288
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:25,151
Astronaut in iot World we're not sure if we turn off access to say

1289
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,711
Yaga cam.com

1290
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
Access to our servers

1291
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,039
We're not sure if

1292
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,087
Anymore because

1293
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,135
BSR services

1294
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
Dad

1295
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
Are essential

1296
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,719
Functionalities

1297
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,999
All iot devices

1298
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,303
The same case goes with smart TVs

1299
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,887
We tried blocking some of the actual names in smart TVs

1300
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,423
Some channels

1301
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,447
So it is

1302
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,495
Quite difficult to take

1303
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:56,127
This point even though you know that your devices are potentially talking to data aggregators

1304
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,431
Chinese servers

1305
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,711
At this point

1306
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,503
There's little you can do

1307
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,575
Well that is demoralizing

1308
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:08,159
I feel like on that note we should end this conversation

1309
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:13,535
I don't know how well consumers understand this I think tools like what you guys are offering is a

1310
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,559
Great first step to

1311
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,887
Help them understand so I really appreciate you doing that

1312
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
And

1313
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,191
Coming on the show this week

1314
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,239
Thank you so much for having me

1315
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:29,407
That's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like me

1316
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:34,015
Moraiyo Tino's sign up for my newsletter at Stacey on iot

1317
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,087
Dot-com will see you next week
