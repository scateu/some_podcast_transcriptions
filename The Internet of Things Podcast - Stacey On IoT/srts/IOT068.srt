5
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,432
Filled with

6
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,456
Well

7
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,016
The biggest eel happening was arm

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
Getting purchase

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,088
Is there actually a offer from SoftBank

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,904
We've got an FTC advisory for your smart home

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,184
Devices

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,232
We're going to be talking about garage door openers

13
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,000
Locks

14
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,048
Some smaller news and

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,400
WiFi and privacy just because that never gets old

16
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:43,264
In our guest is the CEO of arable which is a company that is

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,032
Taking

18
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:44,800
Data

19
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,824
About farming

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360
To Dura Spanish me

21
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
You're going to like it

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,176
Culottes

23
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,480
I thought were to have a Pokemon go I guess not

24
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,504
No no that was last week

25
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,296
Pokemon go is over

26
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,112
A lot of people paranoid

27
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
They are

28
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,416
But I walk the dog at play

29
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,744
You did start playing

30
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:08,352
I did I did while the kids are playing on Mike let me go see what's what here and

31
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,888
Yes I installed it

32
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,472
I walk the dog it's the only time I fired up

33
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,800
Cuz I got to walk in like 5 6 times a day there's a park across the street

34
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,616
We take half mile to mile walks and

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,688
I caught Pokemon while he does his business

36
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,480
Rate

37
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,272
That's probably a good time to end

38
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
Agency

39
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
For reality

40
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,136
Cuz I don't like the actual reality of that time

41
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
Yatagan Valley

42
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
Alright so

43
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232
What start off with

44
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
Arm

45
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
Because that's probably

46
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,328
Barney anything exciting happening

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
Couple days the biggest news we're going to see this week

48
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,656
I se biggest

49
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
Ship deals

50
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
Maybe

51
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
Comment

52
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
Trivago

53
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
In terms of dollars

54
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
Okay

55
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,408
I was looking at was even looking at it from a financial standpoint but you're right

56
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,552
Pronunciation standpoint I think it's the biggest deal in 10 years since Intel sold office exhale business

57
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
Oh wow that's a pretty

58
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
And that was that

59
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,440
Exactly

60
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,488
Suzhou future in small chip

61
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,536
2006

62
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:14,912
Well for people who like oh God they just went off the deep end here's what happened if you miss it

63
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,728
SoftBank which is a Japanese will call it a

64
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,056
Paying a conglomerate

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Carrier

66
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,384
And Sprint

67
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
Here in the US

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
That

69
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,760
It made a buyout offer at 17 pounds per share so that is

70
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,088
24.3 billion pounds

71
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
432 billion dollars

72
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Boom

73
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,488
Which is the company that makes

74
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
The

75
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,048
Design for

76
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
Mobile chips

77
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
And micro

78
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Microprocessor

79
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,472
Actually produce any chips at all

80
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
A design

81
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
The chips that pretty much

82
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,872
In just about every mobile device these days

83
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,152
For people such as

84
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:02,016
Apple Samsung Qualcomm Rockchip mediatek

85
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,600
It does it even includes companies now designing server chips

86
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,392
Amazon actually make

87
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Pixar base chips

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Which I always thought

89
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,768
I did not know they were a licensee of army

90
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,792
They must be

91
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,096
Arm does not disclose its licensees

92
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,912
But it's licensees are welcome to say that there

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
Licensing arm

94
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
I'd like to say that

95
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
So much

96
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,360
And so basically this steal everyone's like

97
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
Oh my gosh

98
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,688
This is crazy it did come way out of left

99
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
There's a couple things

100
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
Think about

101
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,064
One topic started talking to arm

102
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,136
About two weeks ago apparently with the steel which puts it about

103
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
Two weeks after

104
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
Brexit vote

105
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
And the pound

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,024
When dropping

107
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
So

108
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,352
There's this idea that this is the first babe

109
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
Tech acquisition after the brexit

110
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,680
End

111
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
Matters

112
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm not sure that it really does

113
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,432
I'm going to say it might be cuz I think the pound is down

114
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,272
I'm going to take a guess here so don't quote me by mass at least 20%

115
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Since

116
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
The brexit

117
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
But they are paying

118
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,208
They are paying 70 times the annual net

119
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
Income I believe of arm

120
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
It is

121
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
It is not

122
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
And you know that's

123
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
One of the reason

124
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,495
Arm is always been in a weird space

125
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
Because

126
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
It is I always call it an arms dealer

127
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
2

128
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,639
Any hardware maker and it is

129
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
It's designs

130
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,735
Mean that basically no chip company could ever perch

131
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Because

132
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,855
If your Qualcomm or if your Apple and suddenly

133
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,951
Apple purchases arm than qualcomm's going to be like Willow now

134
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,279
That's not cool I can't decide my chips using the arm architecture

135
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,607
Regulatory with wood would hold that up I would think

136
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
Also regular

137
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
I just think the customers

138
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
Wyoming living

139
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
So

140
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,335
That was always an issue and has are moved into servers and other markets

141
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
Companies like Google that may have been acquirers

142
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,711
Suddenly we're kind of left out

143
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:15,135
So don't wouldn't kind of saw this coming arms always been attractive but it's never been like oh I'm going to pay a lot for this because

144
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
It was unclear how you can get a lot of value

145
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
There's no Center

146
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Yeah

147
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,863
I have an open question and we're not going to get the answer for quite some time if we ever do it all

148
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,239
But my thought is based on the that's 70 x net income

149
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Metric

150
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,127
And the amount of money that is SoftBank is coming up with to do this deal

151
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
I'm wondering

152
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
FB

153
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,271
License fees will slowly creep up a little

154
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
Faster so to speak because they

155
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
I would imagine it's been going up steadily

156
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
4 years

157
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,183
Apus

158
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
What I call a

159
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
Expected basis

160
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Rape

161
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
Will bees fees go up higher than expected in the in the coming years I Wonder Pets off and try to make back some of that money

162
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
That is one of the question

163
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
So

164
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,543
I'm talking to a couple of Chip companies Slater

165
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
Our licensees to figure some of this

166
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
1 is

167
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
Hey are you worried about price raises

168
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
But the other is

169
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,599
Owner even if it's someone who's not necessarily competitor

170
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
Simply because

171
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:24,511
Well SoftBank has pledged to double the employee headcount in the UK and

172
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
Invest in arm

173
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,119
It's an arm could certainly use it

174
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,703
It's really unclear if softbank's really going to go there

175
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,311
Because I mean if you look at it Sprint deal it invested quite a bit in Sprint but

176
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,175
Do not invest Weller wisely I would say it it felt like that's that's not a great deal

177
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,503
Right that's a valid concern because I mean if

178
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
The

179
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,671
Case of innovation coming from arm suddenly stops so at a company sort of stagnates or just

180
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
Goes to hell in a handbasket

181
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,999
What's that do to the mobile industry

182
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
I mean

183
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
. sexy

184
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
Chip industry not just that like

185
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
Cannot display

186
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:09,055
Arm has Graphics processors that they're still a relatively small part of the market but

187
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
Yes

188
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,663
It's 95% of all smartphones have arm-based

189
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
Instruction sets

190
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Possibly all now

191
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
Asus phones out there

192
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,695
You know whenever some Dell

193
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,023
Android tablets although Del is getting out of that business

194
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583
Subway 95% sounds about right but I mean

195
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
There's a couple things you got the devices

196
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:39,007
Then you've got what about all the software that runs on these devices if there's a whole new architecture that has to be built because

197
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Armies

198
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
No not

199
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
Cutting it anymore

200
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
The implications could be massive

201
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Chester UK

202
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Massive pregnant

203
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,247
There are alternatives out there

204
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
And not just mobile there's also

205
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:56,671
Servers because arm is getting in there although that's not widespread by any stretch of the imagination

206
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
And then there's

207
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,559
Cellular base station equipment they actually have some quarters that are used in

208
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
Cellular network

209
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,655
And there's all the microprocessors

210
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
So

211
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,263
I'll put a lot of power and softbank's pocket

212
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
It does

213
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,151
I mean alarm had that power before sex it's no different in that respect but

214
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,199
Arm is a known entity in this face

215
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
It would have been around since the 80s

216
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,903
Was it I thought of the acorn computer

217
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,975
So the acorn computer guys and apple got together

218
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,279
Formerly spun off arm

219
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
In 1990

220
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,119
Dairy okay so they were talking before him

221
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
Yashow market

222
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Picture was great

223
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
So

224
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,055
Yes we will see because

225
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
Again

226
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
This is huge

227
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Huge

228
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,015
And we've had this like benevolent are

229
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Grace Slick

230
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
Climatic

231
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
British

232
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
Stated company that's like

233
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
You know investing in

234
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Putting out

235
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
New cores

236
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
And working with everybody

237
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,607
You know what the video call, summation Apple

238
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
Samsung I mean

239
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,495
There's hundreds of companies are using the architecture gear

240
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,567
If I'm not mistaken I'm sure you noticed there's

241
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,127
Two different type of licenses so you can just

242
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
License

243
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
The Beast

244
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
Arm Staffing

245
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
Credit chip based on the basics

246
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,807
Where you can customize and pay extra and so on so forth

247
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,879
And that's what Apple does and I think Samsung and some others

248
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
Yes those are called

249
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,743
That's that's the word I was looking for

250
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
Is something wrong with anybody so I'm going back to my

251
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,607
Open question about

252
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
Pricing

253
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,727
Backwards potentially squeeze out a lot of these smaller chip makers

254
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,591
You know and then granted the bigger ones will be happy to take up the slack but

255
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
I don't know

256
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
More questions than answers than answers in the stomach

257
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,759
It's true it feels like Switzerland just got invaded by a like

258
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
Let's just say Japan

259
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
What's that mean

260
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,487
I'm sorry but you totally falls apart we should

261
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
Just go English just got invaded by Japan

262
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
All right

263
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
No more

264
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Noma

265
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,631
Okay that's the arm news

266
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,935
Let's move on to

267
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
I don't know

268
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
You want to talk about privacy

269
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
We should talk about

270
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,823
Privacy only because

271
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,175
It came up it just before the show you and I were chatting out what to talk about this weekend

272
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,735
We had a pretty Full Slate but then we noticed

273
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,783
That a new startup

274
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
A Wi-Fi * called is in reach

275
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,415
Just emerged from stealth with 15 million dollars

276
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,023
And apparently and I'm just quoting from the Ford Store that covered this

277
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,375
One third of the city of San Francisco has log into

278
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,191
Zenreach without ever realizing it

279
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,519
Which got us thinking about privacy so we start digging around

280
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
Within Reach one of you tell them what it is I'm going to let the Privacy is a company that advertises itself

281
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,039
It provides free Wifi for restaurants cafes

282
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
Other places

283
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
And it's basically

284
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,927
It's a little different from the sponsor y5 Market

285
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
Because

286
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:14,815
They provided you tell login to give them your email address they give that to the

287
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,607
Business owner they make miniature

288
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
Event list for the business owner Etc

289
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
Your Mac address

290
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
Send your email associated with that

291
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
Get sent as in reach

292
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
When you sign up for that

293
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
Free Wi-Fi access

294
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
End

295
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
Then when you walk in

296
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Later

297
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,527
Anytime even if you don't log into their Network

298
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,343
They'll know it's you because they got your Mac address

299
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,183
Right which is a very unique identifier of the hardware in your phone or tablet

300
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
What so

301
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,791
That's kind of interesting and doing things because there's

302
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,375
Euclid actually does this

303
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
It's the same thing actually they they track

304
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
People's Mac addresses

305
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Yeah

306
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:59,103
Packers have used this in the past on both Wi-Fi on your phone and even on Bluetooth devices

307
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
Because when your phone doesn't

308
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
The place in your Wi-Fi network is on

309
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
It basically tries

310
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
It runs through all its Wi-Fi network

311
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
Works looking for one that it's been on

312
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Data is

313
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Captured

314
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,231
And by analyzing at they can figure out

315
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
Random things like

316
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,351
Attach most often to a Wi-Fi network in this part of the city

317
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Or

318
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Etcetera

319
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,703
The difference here is Centereach gets all of that data

320
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Plus

321
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Your

322
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
Yeah and that whole quote about

323
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,383
In 1/3 of the city San Francisco

324
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,455
Login is invalid even knowing it that's what kind of thinking

325
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:41,855
Will the sky be Travis implications there so we took a quick look realtor.com privacy

326
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
If you're in California you're kind of

327
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
Up the creek

328
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:49,791
Because right at the bathroom saying we don't even recognize and respond to the do not track signals in California cuz

329
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,375
Bethel still in flux so you can print it trying to block it that way

330
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
You can opt out

331
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:01,311
But you pretty much and can't use the Wi-Fi networks of the retail establishments at all as I read it

332
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
Right

333
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
Topped out

334
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:07,967
You would have to go to the network advertising initiative or there is a formal

335
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
Do not track

336
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
Effort

337
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,831
California California

338
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Macarena

339
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,951
Turn your Wi-Fi off a side which is very nice of them to suggest

340
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
Oh

341
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,535
You can use the digital advertising Alliance

342
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
Consumer opt-out

343
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
Or the network advertising

344
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,215
So both of those places but

345
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,287
None of those places actually guarantee and if you

346
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
Anything like clear cookies

347
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,407
All of that actually can go away cuz they put a cookie on your phone saying

348
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
Participating advertisers.

349
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
So

350
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
I

351
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
Because

352
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
In the master of is this than that

353
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,951
Actually wanted to let you guys know I know on my phone I use

354
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,767
A simple is this and that recipe

355
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,095
For when my phone goes out of my home Wi-Fi

356
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,167
Automatically turns the Wifi off on my handset

357
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,959
So this has to

358
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,263
Nice things it saves battery life marginal

359
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
And it also

360
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
Helps cut down on tracking

361
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
I want my network Sia

362
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
That's an option

363
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
If you're like

364
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,551
Forgetful and don't wanna manually turn off your network that's

365
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,599
Double and then you can always turn it back on

366
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
If you're like oh I need Wi-Fi

367
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
If not it's a good thing that's a good trick

368
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
I imagine you can do it on iOS to cuz

369
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
But I've no

370
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
I sent I don't have an iOS

371
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:33,215
That's a good question if I was a little more finicky about

372
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,799
External control of phone settings and such

373
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Supreme

374
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Detailed iOS

375
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Yasso

376
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
I don't know

377
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,527
That Maybe not maybe so that's the

378
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
Messy stuff

379
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
I don't know what to tell you

380
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
Your privacy is basically a force

381
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
Other things happening

382
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
The FTC

383
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,815
Speaking of privacy is looking out for us

384
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,119
They put out an advisory last week

385
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
On

386
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,191
Basically talking about

387
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
After the nest revolve

388
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Tissue

389
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,079
Asking people who manufacture devices

390
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
To consider

391
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Not sun setting them in such a

392
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Terrible

393
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,759
Careful way

394
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
This is like the most

395
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
Toothless Pig

396
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
But it is like

397
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,975
The FTC to look into the hole

398
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,559
Nest reball shut down between I know we talked about

399
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
Several days ago

400
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:36,703
And decided not to further investigate into it based on several reasons one was he

401
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,263
The actual users of the product

402
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,799
I guess they felt it was

403
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
Not

404
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:46,431
Large enough to make that big of a deal obviously if you are one of those affected you will feel otherwise and

405
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
I totally appreciate that but

406
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,039
Yes so they they did come up with is your right it's a toothless

407
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,647
Blog post essentially saying what happens when the sun sets on a smart product

408
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
You know they mentioned

409
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,487
Meme nesting revolver

410
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
But they did say

411
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,863
Yeah of a recent investigation into one company's decision kind of prompt it us.

412
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
Take a look at this and

413
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:11,519
So that they're giving some guidelines to companies who make iot devices to deal better with

414
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Consumers

415
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
And then be more transparent

416
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
And I would like to

417
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
To say that these are actually

418
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,247
I said guidelines so the first is are you selling a device a service or both

419
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
What are you telling consumers

420
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
That you're selling

421
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Cuz a lot of

422
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,487
Will tell you something in the value is in the software and services

423
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
But they're telling you

424
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,375
I'm not paying $250 for a nest thermostat because it looks pretty

425
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,911
I know some people do but

426
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,215
If it suddenly broke on my wallet

427
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
Because I know

428
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
Think of it as Justice

429
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:50,687
Are consumers getting a fixed term rental or subscription are they getting something they will own and can rely on for the life their device

430
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
Most companies

431
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,551
Choose to do a one-time purchase because

432
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,903
Consumers hate paying for subscriptions but if the FTC wants to really start asking

433
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,719
Questions about that that could really change that business model

434
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,279
I like the very last one actually

435
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,119
What did you tell consumers at the outset or what would

436
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
They otherwise expect

437
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
About the security would provide for the life of the device

438
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,847
Credit as a vendor with sunsetting devices well because there's residual data afterwards but

439
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,175
I like the security aspect like that they're asking that question

440
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,479
An unrelated note very related note

441
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:30,367
Since I moved recently I left my nest in the old house and I put the ecobee3 in here as we talked about last week

442
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,207
When I deactivated my Nest I got a nice confirmation email

443
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
So you want to close your account

444
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
I did that

445
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
I sent me a confirmation email after that saying

446
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,911
We removed all of your information from our servers and so on so forth so that

447
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,239
That was a great way to handle that not so much on the revolve side but

448
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,543
I'm a mess I with my data that was great

449
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
Got it

450
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,919
Show me

451
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,479
As a consumer also

452
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,527
As a recent picture

453
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:03,391
Isn't just telling you this because they think it'll be nice they're telling you this is a warning

454
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,719
Unfortunately or fortunately depending on your point of view

455
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
Agency

456
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
Is

457
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,303
Not going to Lake

458
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
Right off of the big steak

459
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
Start beating people with it

460
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,911
They are specific

461
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Stop showing their stick

462
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
Look what we have

463
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
This is what we care about

464
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
We have a stick

465
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
They're not afraid to use it

466
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
Not at least so far

467
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
Post presidential alert

468
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Everything

469
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,759
Alright what else do we have

470
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
Forget the docket I'm going to interject

471
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
I must

472
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Okay

473
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,231
Because you assign me homework about a year ago and I finally completed it

474
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,047
Insteon homework

475
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,655
Now when I thought I thought I was going to be

476
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:52,799
My dog ate that I got it no the quick

477
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,591
Z-Wave lock

478
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
I forgotten

479
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
I know it's been awhile

480
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
O'Jays

481
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,111
Well I it just made sense to put it in because

482
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:12,511
When we got to the townhouse I figured I have to rekey the locks and change all the locks that's in all the way to 2nd station

483
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
Kwikset Z-Wave lock

484
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,399
Maybe a year ago it's got to keypad that connects to my wink

485
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
Install it over the weekend

486
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,727
It's working super super well

487
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,079
I get concerned that there's four batteries inside you you supply the batteries I have

488
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,383
How many Loops in there for

489
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,711
Double-a any loops and I don't know how long they last

490
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:37,343
Is right now nobody's carrying keys or I'll just use the keypad to get in and get out where using phone unlock the door with

491
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,415
No batteries means no exit and no entry

492
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
If it's locked

493
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,975
So I will say so

494
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
Since we had ours up for

495
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
Probably a little over two years

496
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,607
They've lasted between 6 and 8 months

497
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,447
Stay last less login

498
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,239
But recently

499
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,823
If we actually had a bachelorette because bad batteries fit

500
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,127
They stopped working after like a week it was crazy

501
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
I will say though

502
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,223
The manufacturer says that if you put batteries in

503
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
And you don't

504
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
Connected to anything

505
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,599
It's going to rain a lot faster cuz it's constantly

506
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:15,999
Painting to look for a Z-Wave device if you're not going to have it hooked up to something for a while

507
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
The radio chip out

508
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,863
Well yeah I'll leave it in because it's it's

509
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,191
Connected to the wink Hub which obviously I put in prior to the

510
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,495
The quixotic setup on my lights and everything else and

511
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,055
I'm back to the way I was in the old house

512
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
On my lights and such so

513
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,663
That's good to know but I'm going to leave those better than cuz if it's working great

514
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,199
I love having to be honest

515
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Awesome

516
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,271
I see we got a visit from Norm here

517
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
Yeah

518
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Smaller house

519
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
Happy

520
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,975
He's adorable if you're not following Kevin on

521
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,607
On Instagram I should just get him his own darn account but yeah

522
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,399
Play I put on warm

523
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
After all the pictures

524
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
Is going nuts

525
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,591
Okay so some quick news to round out the show

526
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,895
Is wechat skybell

527
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,943
My favorite HD doorbell

528
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,759
Out there right now although I haven't tried the ring Pro so

529
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,087
Skybell is connected with SmartThings

530
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
Yay so if you have those two devices you cannot make them work

531
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:22,304
Work together this is also a good time to say that I'm a little disappointed in August right now because I have the August

532
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
Connected doorbells and things

533
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:28,960
Promise that 90 days after the product launch they would have motion sensing

534
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
And

535
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
The ability to save your

536
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,800
Videos

537
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
And so far they don't yet

538
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,616
We are now past

539
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,920
30 days it was supposed to be about the end of June

540
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
So

541
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,248
I felt like I'd wait a little while and

542
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,808
Before saying anything because you know things do take time

543
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
But

544
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,160
Clocks ticking clock is ticking

545
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,440
I have two of those and I

546
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,792
I'm kind of a little miffed that I bought these on this promise that so far hasn't been delivered

547
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,072
Maybe I should get a prorated

548
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
So there's something else the FTC

549
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
You can look at

550
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,192
And finally the White House

551
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
As part of the

552
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
Kind of

553
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
White standing bunch of investment

554
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
They have

555
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,640
Said they're investing in four hundred million dollars in

556
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,736
What does this mean exactly

557
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:19,392
It basically means that they're doing a bunch of initiatives through the advanced Wireless research initiative is part of the Nationals

558
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
Science Foundation

559
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,696
In 5G Network

560
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
So

561
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,536
It's not actually iot it's more than networks

562
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
Iot

563
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
But it's a lot of money

564
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
Question about or noting

565
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,448
Its and it's

566
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,800
Early days for five DMV that's becoming the buzzword I remember when the whole 4G thing hit

567
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,616
You know two years before we actually saw an implementation but

568
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
This exciting stuff

569
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,200
You know too much speed of a network

570
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,760
Interesting

571
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:52,160
The FCC last week said that they were going to give basically 1100 gigahertz of spectrum over to 5G

572
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,488
And when the FCC

573
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
All frequencies

574
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,376
A range of frequencies above 24 gigahertz

575
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,448
That's on the Spectrum chart that's going to way up there

576
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
That spectrum is

577
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,288
You know that's not going through walls very well

578
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:13,152
It's not great Spectrum but we've got a bunch of new technologies that make it a lot easier to use

579
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
Ardmore economic ice

580
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,248
So that's what the FCC

581
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,344
What do you Telecom guys talk about when they talk about 5G is actually

582
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,136
3gpp standard

583
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
Which is kind of like LTE

584
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,232
And what's interesting here is

585
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,024
5G isn't just about

586
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,328
Mobile broadband like LTE was

587
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,144
Angie is going to be about interfacing

588
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,752
Networks in the cloud together to deliver specific type of apps

589
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,056
So like there might be standards or

590
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,616
Protocols for connected cars

591
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,456
And then there might be a slice of the 5G Spectrum allocated to

592
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
Hospital

593
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
So

594
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,320
There's going to be a lot of interesting stuff here but

595
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,856
Until it gets a little bit

596
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
More clear we're just going to have to wait

597
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:01,280
Before they close since you mentioned frequencies can I just make note of one

598
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,560
Interesting tidbit

599
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,120
O spectral stuff

600
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
Well not for long story

601
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Do it

602
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,520
So I came across a very interesting article from Marco

603
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,848
Armand to is a iOS Developer pretty print iOS Developer

604
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,920
He was having problem with his cars Homelink transmitter

605
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:23,040
You would open the garage door but more often than not it would not close the garage door which is like

606
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,112
You pulling out of the driveway hit the button and why is the garage door

607
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
Closing

608
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,440
Well he did some digging and

609
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
Found out that

610
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Pierce

611
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:36,352
Issue had to do with a no-name LED light bulb in his garage door opener

612
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:43,008
The reason he found his Nabi saw an article that says government guidelines for Led manufacturers require these control circuit

613
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,544
Semi LEDs to operate

614
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,360
A frequencies between 30 and 300 megahertz

615
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
By coincidence

616
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:55,040
You know it's most rush or opener remotes have been assigned frequencies between 288 and 360 megahertz so

617
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:58,112
There may have been some crosstalk overlap there

618
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,696
Sure enough he took the No Name LED bulb output in an old incandescent

619
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
Problem solved

620
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:08,608
Which was kind of interested in condesa actually burned out later the same day but that's just a very funny site

621
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,912
Okay tell is it the No Name

622
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,984
LED bulbs like what a named LED bulb work better

623
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,872
Depends on yeah I guess it depends on testing what frequencies are using I don't I couldn't say for sure I mean

624
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
I would

625
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,992
It would be nice if he had put in some different brands of bulbs to find out

626
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,832
But he just said I want to sell my garage door problems original bulb

627
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
Okay

628
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
Alright well I think

629
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
That's it for

630
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
Today Show

631
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
Please

632
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,280
Stay tuned for Adam Wolf the CEO of arable

633
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,352
As we talked about Precision farming and The Internet of Things

634
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:46,752
Hey this is Stacey Higginbotham breaking into the iot podcast for a message from our sponsor

635
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:51,360
Exactly which is a iot platform as a service

636
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,384
And we have

637
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
Patty

638
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,176
Sweetheart

639
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,736
Who is the GM exactly who to talk to

640
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,600
In the connected home space we're seeing a lot faster.

641
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
What's the Internet of Things

642
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Why is that

643
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
Thank you Jay Z

644
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:11,328
I think the primary reason is that the users and the connected home segments are more willing than

645
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,888
Others to push the envelope and take risks

646
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,728
In order to get much better immersive experience

647
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,312
This typically leads to faster refresh Cycles in a connected home

648
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,896
Space where product Williams or manufacturers are

649
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:29,760
Innovating very rapidly even if they have to subsidize the hardware acquisition cost

650
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,040
2klab adoption

651
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:36,928
Think about it most of the products in the connected home space are still operating independently

652
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464
So as much

653
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,768
Traction as we have already seen the space

654
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
Just getting started

655
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,352
What are some insights for the early adoption in the

656
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,704
Vacations from users have evolved very rapidly

657
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,008
Onboarding app experience

658
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,544
Service expectations

659
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,384
From users have dramatically changed over the last several years

660
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:00,736
The more successful connected-home members are the ones that fully Embrace this

661
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,832
And we strive to deliver delightful experiences and first class

662
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,112
Support for these

663
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
Connected Home Products

664
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:11,232
What is a Fast & Furious the time-to-market and time in Market

665
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,864
The best companies in the connected home and and even have the larger scope of the Enterprise segment

666
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
Don't waste their time

667
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
In the lab

668
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,496
Trying to build infrastructure and plumbing Technologies

669
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:27,360
But they tried to get to Market as quickly as possible so that they can learn from

670
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,408
Their products getting adopted

671
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,968
Rather than spending time building infrastructure

672
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,016
We tend to think about this as connect

673
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,808
The product management are the

674
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:40,160
Suite of applications that really enable East product Williams to get to Market

675
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,696
In the quickest possible time

676
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,280
All right how do you see the iot market transforming over the next

677
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:52,192
I strongly believe that in the next few years we will stop thinking about iot as a stand-alone phenomenon connectivity in physical

678
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,776
Products will soon become an expected part or

679
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,080
Unexpected feature of

680
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:04,480
Everyday products and customers will begin to expect iot functionality on anything and everything that has a scent

681
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,576
On off switch with this changing expectations from consumers

682
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,160
Connacht williamsville soon be able to deliver products

683
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,696
That allowed them to get

684
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,744
Much closer with their end customers

685
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
I'll also give them

686
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,328
Valuable insights into how their products

687
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,632
Are being used and consumed

688
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,704
So that they can create and deploy new features

689
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,008
Instagram to their Hardware products

690
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,336
What should I call we deliver software over the internet today

691
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:35,200
Century all of this guy's back to product Williams having the capability to

692
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,504
Create new business models using their physic

693
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,552
Awesome and Patty

694
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
How can we find you

695

Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house

698
00:28:55,168 --> 00:29:01,056
Stacey Higginbotham and I am with Adam wolf who is the founder and CEO of arable Labs Inc

699
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,848
Hello how are you

700
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
I'm doing great

701
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
HD here

702
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,224
Awesome I'm excited to have you because arable

703
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,016
Is a startup or going to

704
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,296
Protocol UA

705
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,832
Startup in the world

706
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
Farming

707
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
And The Internet of Things

708
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,416
And then we'll take into kind of

709
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,208
What you guys see yourself doing

710
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:22,048
So quickly you guys call yourself actually a risk

711
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
Management

712
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,144
Can you talk about kind of arable in that context

713
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
You're not as we

714
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
Started the

715
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,800
Company

716
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
From a lot of different

717
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
People

718
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Drum

719
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,664
Crop insurance

720
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
People developing

721
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,248
Watermark at 2

722
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,528
People managing

723
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,600
Giftster and bonding and rely

724
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,648
What do all these people have

725
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:52,512
Is the day you need to know what's the difference between

726
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,304
What they thinking

727
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,352
True and what's actually true

728
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,144
What are the facts on the ground

729
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,704
Collecting data that

730
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
Really

731
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,032
The story of what's Happening

732
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Plants

733
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,336
Prospective

734
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,360
And the weather

735
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,432
That is the key right here is part of your strategy

736
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,992
Not just data delivering

737
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,040
Inside let's talk about

738
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,880
Your sensor because you guys are launching a physical sensor

739
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,672
Why go physical Hardware

740
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
You're really real

741
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,512
Interesting

742
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,280
I got my

743
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
PhD

744
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,888
Stanford sponsored by NASA

745
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
Satellite data

746
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,448
Which means

747
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,520
I got complicated model of how plants work

748
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,568
And just like a weather forecast.

749
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,360
Constantly checking the

750
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:43,456
State the system again these observations in this case from saddle

751
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
So

752
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,808
I got to the end of that and I realized

753
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
The band

754
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,416
There's a lot of other stuff that you really want to know

755
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,952
Like what was the weather

756
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
What did the person plant

757
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
It also

758
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
Discerning

759
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,072
Coincidence

760
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,608
Set of data

761
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
Not just

762
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,168
State of the plant

763
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,960
Sound like

764
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,544
The shape

765
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:13,664
Why is this plant growing faster here than this same plant over there

766
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,712
Not really required

767
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
Merging

768
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,528
Microclimate

769
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
And

770
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,320
Plants

771
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
Probation

772
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,624
Which is black

773
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,976
Okay it in our conversations before this you would talked about

774
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,792
Your business model and it is to

775
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
License

776
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,608
These pods two companies

777
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
And then you also have kind of a

778
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:40,800
Data analytics service I guess it's the best way to put it I'm not sure

779
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,848
And is

780
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,616
Really

781
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,456
Are North Stars around empowering people

782
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
To make

783
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,016
Decisions around

784
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,296
Natural res

785
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,368
Listen to company is not

786
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
Bounce

787
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,184
To this device

788
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
And yet

789
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
We knew

790
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Because of

791
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,352
All of our prior work that this is a pinch point for us

792
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:11,008
They also discovered there's a pinch point for a lot of people that actual grounds

793
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,544
Focusing

794
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,104
On making a device

795
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,384
That is

796
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664
Globally

797
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Scalable

798
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,968
Pick one device

799
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,016
And it becomes mass-produced

800
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
Costco

801
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
Because

802
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
Vanishingly small

803
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:34,048
You know we have to look back at how we understand

804
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,912
In a really fairly marginal small holders

805
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,472
Outlander parts of the

806
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
Developing world

807
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
All the way up

808
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,824
Into the most Elites

809
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
Tulip farm

810
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,664
And raspberry producers

811
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,968
Well over $100,000

812
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,272
Break all of these rely

813
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,064
You can use data

814
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
Gods

815
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,624
The value-add

816
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,160
Crothall beans

817
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,208
Parts of agriculture

818
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
So how would it

819
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,304
BBA

820
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,352
Giant soybean

821
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:13,216
Grower use your stop which I'm assuming is kind of a lower value crop

822
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,288
Versus someone who's making raspberries

823
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,336
The challenge

824
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,640
Or start up like orange

825
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,944
Is really to recognize the

826
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,504
Midwest is bad

827
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,296
The Ukraine is Basque

828
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,624
All the places where they grow commodity

829
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
Crocs

830
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,208
Are extremely expensive

831
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:40,096
You know I'll send it has to be said that when commodity prices are depressed

832
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,912
Money into

833
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,704
Uncertain value

834
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,288
Is the investment in this piece of Hardware really going to

835
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,312
Unlock

836
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,128
What they need to be unlocking until

837
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,176
Really the path to Market is

838
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
The work

839
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,224
West the

840
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:02,880
Agricultural service providers that are already in those fields working with left they profit by

841
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,208
Where the crop advisors

842
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,256
They are

843
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,304
Like the tech support in many ways

844
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
That's the person

845
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,656
Who can really look at the data

846
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
Say okay

847
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,496
We're going to change our plans we're not going to be

848
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
Here today

849
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,592
We're going to have to put off till next week after this Halestorm

850
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:26,176
So in that case you don't tell directly to the farmers you're going to sell

851
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,736
Agricultural service

852
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,784
Yes exactly

853
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,368
And it's time to do a couple things that I think other businesses can

854
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,392
Take something away from

855
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Which is

856
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,256
You guys have recognized that the data that you're Gathering

857
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
It's not the be-all end-all

858
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,608
Is the insights in the ability to help a company

859
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
Kind of offer

860
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
Risk management

861
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:51,776
And you also realize that the people you benefit may not be your actual End customer

862
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Because

863
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,824
They may not have

864
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,104
Either the income

865
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,920
The sophistication

866
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,968
So kind of what you guys are trying to offer

867
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,296
So I'd love to kind of understand how you

868
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,112
Figured this out because it's a hard thing for

869
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Businesses were like

870
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Hey

871
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
We should totally connect

872
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,232
You know and get data from

873
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,536
This particular aspect of our world and then

874
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,072
Try to sell that

875
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,608
So how did you kind of

876
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,632
Get to this point

877
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,192
It starts with a lot of list

878
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
And it's

879
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Somebody

880
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,544
I don't pop out

881
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
You're talking about something

882
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Then

883
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,896
You're not solving

884
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
Often times

885
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
Let's say

886
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
California

887
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,296
That would be the widespread for

888
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Perception

889
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,856
Farmers

890
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,624
AR

891
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,208
Experiencing a pain Point around irrigation management

892
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:48,096
And you might take a technology about this is measuring

893
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,936
Wishing you would want to measure

894
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,800
And yeah if you talk to the farmer's day like I've got

895
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,128
A magic sensor that will tell you when to water

896
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,664
They roll their eyes

897
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:06,528
Now that's a I'll call you might be the 10th person through my door that does that

898
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,088
To be honest we've got a guy who does that

899
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,880
China weekly schedule

900
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
It's not

901
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
Like a plan

902
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:18,560
But if you go to that same person

903
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,400
Yul destination crop forecasting

904
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
Or

905
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,984
Decisions about marketing

906
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
Their eyes pop out

907
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,336
So what does that mean to like somebody who is not a friend

908
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,384
It's like how many berries are in the field

909
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
Whataburger

910
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:39,296
Absolutely how many berries in the field or another customers how many

911
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,320
All right with you

912
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:44,928
Isn't interested the used taste around lettuce production in the UK

913
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,512
Just a couple days different in the face

914
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,864
Makes a big difference on where we saw

915
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
But what

916
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,448
So you could tell me if I were a UK lettuce farmer

917
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Are you can say

918
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
Hey

919
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,848
It's going to rain tomorrow so you should Harvest today or do you instead tell me

920
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:08,992
Hey this field got rained on so if you can hold it for two more days it'll dry out and then it'll have a longer shelf life

921
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,528
Absolutely

922
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,064
Both of those or

923
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,136
You know we control remotely

924
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,256
Because we are measuring a particular set of set of parameters

925
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,840
Elephants have condensation

926
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,888
It's a. Might say okay

927
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,168
This you have to sell

928
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:31,008
At your local market but this you can not ship to Spain

929
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,568
Okay that's useful

930
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,360
So who are your customers

931
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,688
Challenge

932
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
The demand

933
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,040
The expressions of Interest ranging from

934
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,832
Very large

935
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,368
Midwestern

936
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,928
Companies serving commodity agriculture

937
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
Two especially

938
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
Specialty crops

939
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,280
Producers

940
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,864
These folks that often. Grower-shipper said they grow it but they also

941
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
Marketing

942
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
Insurance

943
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
Is a

944
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
As a gigantic interest

945
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,288
Especially in the developing world

946
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:09,408
There's this obstacle to ensuring it which is valid a claim

947
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,200
Even price risk

948
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,248
So we have to look at

949
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,040
Global Entry

950
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,320
And right now we're just

951
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,600
Very carefully

952
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,624
Choosing

953
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,672
People that we want to go eat with

954
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:25,280
Sure so in the case of an insurance firm would they compel the farmers

955
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,328
How to put the sensors in the field

956
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:31,168
And they would be your customer and by the hardware from you

957
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:35,520
And then also the kind of data analytics that come from that Hardware

958
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,824
The exact business model is not in

959
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
Byerly worked out

960
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,504
You're not a participation by the lights of a ID or the World Bank

961
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
Temple

962
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,624
Is East African or even Central African

963
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,160
Maize production

964
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
Farmers

965
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,232
Can achieve much better deal

966
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,536
If they use improved seeds

967
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,328
In fertilizer

968
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,632
Insurance

969
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,656
What place

970
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,448
That bag of grain

971
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,752
Farmers afraid that if he buys it

972
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,336
And put that out and loses the crop to some of them

973
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
That

974
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,896
They're not just

975
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,456
You know hungry but they also lost

976
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,808
Will replace that bag of seeds

977
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,368
But in order to do this we need

978
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,160
To be able to validate

979
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:24,928
Claims

980
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,024
A1 device / Village

981
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,352
Okay see you get a bag of seeds from your insurance

982
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,912
What's this device and then

983
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,704
They ensure that

984
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,032
Crop because they've got a way to kind of

985
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,336
Control in as much as one can

986
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
Against the loss of

987
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,176
Ensure

988
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:51,552
Take the last time you did auto insurance or life insurance

989
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,904
Current history may be William to school

990
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,184
Your mortgage on time

991
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
They're looking at Morrill Hall

992
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,096
So what's interesting now is that once we have devices in

993
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:08,192
Waze

994
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,984
To reach out

995
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,264
Apartments with advice

996
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,056
Make sure

997
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,848
Good day at Sea the best out

998
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
Okay

999
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
In what

1000
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,432
Look ahead 3 years

1001
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,200
Into

1002
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:19,968
Farming

1003
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
As you guys

1004
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Expand

1005
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,296
Totally

1006
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,368
And as Precision agriculture becomes more

1007
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,928
Accepted how does that change the way we

1008
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
Really

1009
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,536
Interesting question we

1010
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,328
Started tracing

1011
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
Really

1012
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
Measurements

1013
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,960
From Farm to Table my wife is a is a chef

1014
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,752
You know she said she worked at

1015
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,568
Some famous restaurants in California where

1016
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,104
The ideal

1017
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
Was really having a row

1018
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,432
Ship with the farmer

1019
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,712
And dessert

1020
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
Thirty-One perfect

1021
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,296
God let's look at

1022
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,320
The date

1023
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,416
There's many opportunities when this came to us on Friday

1024
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,440
Where

1025
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,488
Chastity excited to look at the

1026
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,512
Brix level

1027
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:08,352
Sherpa measure of the flavor and quality of produce

1028
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:13,216
Where farmers are able to provide information

1029
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,240
That lets them

1030
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:17,056
Claim additional Revenue

1031
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
About

1032
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,896
Having more sustainable practices are higher quality

1033
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,712
Potentially reaching

1034
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,504
More local markets

1035
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,784
And so there's a

1036
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,600
Platinum value around

1037
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,928
Deeper connectivity between

1038
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,464
The plate in the field

1039
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Dieting

1040
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,024
Both consumers and farmers

1041
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
Awesome

1042
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
Because yes

1043
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,376
I think everyone has their

1044
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,656
Christian Peach

1045
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,192
Are Christian fruit

1046
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,472
Which is the perfect

1047
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,544
You know for me it's a peach Brothers at maybe an apricot

1048
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,616
And it would be wonderful to be able to recreate that kind

1049
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,407
And make it come

1050
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,967
I mean I have memories that are

1051
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,295
From when I was her crop advisor

1052
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,367
Working around the Lodi area

1053
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,439
Arms that

1054
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,487
Remind boss made

1055
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
Dumbass

1056
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,303
Charice I've ever had in my life

1057
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
Being able to

1058
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,631
But with your taste buds

1059
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,007
Is lost as

1060
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,031
You buy

1061
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,079
Come on Mark produce

1062
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,639
And you don't get a chance

1063
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,711
To say that wasn't the best set of strawberries

1064
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,247
And yet

1065
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,527
We all want that

1066
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,831
Ensure

1067
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,623
What can we do

1068
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,159
2

1069
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,695
Be able to serve you better

1070
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,487
Because that means higher

1071
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:44,351
Got it alright for Adam thank you so much for coming on the podcasts

1072
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,263
Absolutely it has been such a pleasure enjoying talking to me
