Let us talk about

34
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,144
Let us talk about talking

35
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,984
So good news for people who

36
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
Bikes

Google home

38
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
Actually before we get into talking about talking

39
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
Any cool stuff

40
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,712
On the Black Friday deals did you partake of any cool smart home or can I

41
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Home stuff

42
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,600
I did I really held back I should bought something that we had on our

43
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,392
Iot gift guide list

44
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:09,792
I really like that Sonos one review and it's so much that I bought my own which I got like $50 off

45
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
IDE

46
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
I did not get

47
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
Anyting

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,448
I just couldn't pull the trigger

49
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,496
I looked at all this stuff and I

50
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,080
I'm feeling a little bit of Gadget overload in my

51
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
I think it's a function of headache

52
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,480
Too many cables too many apps connecting I just kind of got tired

53
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,552
So I have more than most that I understand

54
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
Yeah I think I've hit a threshold

55
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,416
I didn't but you know

56
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,232
There was some great deals to be had so hopefully

57
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
You guys part 2

58
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,304
Or have you checked out our

59
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
Gift guide

60
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
All right

61
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,400
So back to

62
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
About talking

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,472
Google home is actually getting

64
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
Really valuable skill

65
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,616
So like the Amazon Echo Google home has

66
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,408
They don't call them skills they

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
Call them

68
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
What do they call them

69
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Oh that's

70
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,528
Kakashi's not schedules

71
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
Cannot remember

72
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,512
Soon with the Google home

73
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,816
Instead of saying Okay g

74
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
Talk to

75
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,912
My LG Smart to turn on robot cleaner

76
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
To make your LG Vaca

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
Dinner start cleaning

78
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
Susan able to say

79
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
Okay g

80
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
Start the robot vacuum

81
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
And she's going to know what

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,944
Which is awesome because the biggest challenge I currently have with my Amazon

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Echo

84
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Is

85
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,760
Madam a

86
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
You know ask

87
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,880
June to preheat oven to 450 degrees

88
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Theoretically should not be hard

89
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
But is

90
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
Kind of

91
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,256
Bright red

92
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,656
This is actually this is a key reason why my family doesn't buy into all the voice command stuff that like what did you name that late again

93
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,960
What's that called over there and I

94
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,800
I recognize their frustration so when Amazon actually added the

95
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,128
You know turn on lights to the localized groups

96
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
Not too long ago

97
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,736
Define on using an economic interests a matinee lights off

98
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
Yes

99
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
They're using it now

100
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,136
So this is great because I don't want to remember names of companies and products are ninjas

101
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
The thing I just want the thing to work

102
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Exactly

103
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
Google has released this

104
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
Which means that

105
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
Comedies just now we need to

106
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,863
Create their New Boyz

107
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
This

108
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
If done well

109
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
Could

110
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
Could

111
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Make

112
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
Brands

113
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,847
Like give up the fact that we're going to buy all LG appliances in our home

114
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,383
And instead we could just have a crack

115
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
Optical interface with them

116
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
This Is My Hope

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,295
Samsung's actually the first to implement this too by the way so if you got Samsung appliances

118
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
You might want to test us

119
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,879
Yeah apparently you can say things like pasta dishwasher

120
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
I don't know why anyone would do that

121
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:49,279
My favorite

122
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
How much time is left on my dryer

123
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,447
That's really useful cuz my dryer is upstairs and if I'm downstairs I have to walk

124
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Are you guys

125
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,311
This is life is tough life is tough

126
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
My life is hard

127
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
So

128
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
That is that

129
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
End

130
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
We also have

131
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
News on Amazon

132
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
Madame a skills notification

133
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,831
I'm a little leery this but Kevin you want to tell us what it is

134
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,647
I woke this is actually already in place but it's been

135
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Expanded

136
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,231
I believe how should I don't know exactly when this year it was

137
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:25,119
Amazon said hey we got a developer preview of notifications for Alexa skills and as of

138
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,191
Today in fact they are expanding that to a wider audience

139
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
So this is going to be

140
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,311
A way for you to get personalized notifications in

141
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Save

142
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:40,479
Peekskill I don't know maybe we have an iot podcast skill and maybe we have a notification that your echo says

143
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,527
Does hate there's a new episode would you like to play it

144
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,575
Whenever we have a new episode so

145
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
This is what's coming or going to get hopefully not bombarded with notifications from are echoes but hopefully some valuable ones

146
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
I would like the defaults

147
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
To be for me to set

148
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
Those up as opposed to having the

149
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:02,239
Will and that's fine I don't know exactly how it's going to be by default it's going to be opt-in for user

150
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,055
There's before Easter vacations

151
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,103
So if you don't help in you'll never even get

152
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
Notifications

153
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,223
And then even if you opt-in you can disable or suppress notifications

154
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,575
Hearing your app where you can put devices in Do Not Disturb mode so

155
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
Alright then I feel a little bit.

156
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
My

157
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,047
Amazon Echo waking me up at 5 in the morning to tell me a new iot podcast is dropped

158
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
I actually have

159
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
How to make sure my things

160
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
Polish I have a Nifty

161
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
That

162
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
Turns one of my hue light bulbs red

163
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
So I can always walk downstairs and I'm like

164
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
The pietasters

165
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,223
Quick why is it red red is usually bad make it green

166
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
You know what the old school lights

167
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
And they don't do

168
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,367
I almost was one of my Black Friday almost

169
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,951
Your lights are on sale should I get the newer version and then I'm like

170
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,791
Stacy you spent sixty bucks on these bulbs you are not spending fifty bucks on Brady bulbs

171
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:04,703
Yeah if there's a notification I want I know this is unique to me and other people maybe live in a townhome Community like I do

172
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,287
The mailboxes are down the street obviously not at the houses

173
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:14,687
And I would like to know when the mail gets here and I would love a notification for that in fact I was actually thinking of creating a little dirty

174
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
Board system

175
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,039
That pings me when they open the mailbox

176
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,111
So the challenge actually that's actually very easily doable

177
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
Just a basic sensor

178
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
But exactly

179
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,719
The challenge is getting WiFi

180
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Or connective

181
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,327
Yeah I was going to buy an NB iot Dev board

182
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
Okay yeah like I think particle has

183
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:42,591
Sorry I don't nobody else cares

184
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,407
Actually wanted to set this up like when I first got my smart thing

185
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
Original

186
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
13 and then I was like

187
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
Is like wait a second

188
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:57,695
Maybe we should even talk about this maybe we should build it pat didn't sell it to the US Postal Service

189
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
They got money

190
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,559
Maybe we should build a patent and sell it to Amazon

191
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
All right speaking

192
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
No not speaking of Amazon

193
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,887
We just spoke of her

194
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
Waze

195
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,727
Get a wake word and voice commands

196
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
You are surprised that

197
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
Waze is that still a thing

198
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,407
Will innocent is the implementation Waze is great

199
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,455
Don't get me wrong I know a lot of people use it

200
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,855
But after being purchased by Google and having some of the ways functionality integrate into Google Maps I kind of thought way

201
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,159
Please as a stand-alone was going away

202
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,815
Clearly that's not the case because so many people use the app Waze app and as of today you can on

203
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,143
On iOS or Android use the Waze app to say

204
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,703
I think I can say this because I don't think he'll say anything law

205
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,983
Okay Waze

206
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,055
And basically it's kind of like turn into a voices

207
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
Distance so now you can

208
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,431
Initiate your drive get a preview of the route you can send reports at a pitstop

209
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
All by voice which is

210
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,855
Awesome love it love it it's in the Waze app you going to look in settings

211
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
Sound and voice

212
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
Talk to Waze

213
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,487
And then tell the okay Waze function on

214
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Wow

215
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,607
That's actually pretty cool cuz I don't use it now but now I'm like oh but I could

216
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Okay

217
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983
Voice

218
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,287
Let's move on to China

219
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Because

220
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
China has some news

221
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Rather

222
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
Actually China itself has news

223
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,455
Is China itself

224
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
So

225
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
Two things here

226
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
It has two interesting bits China is

227
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
Beginning to set standards for the smart

228
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
This is the

229
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,511
Okay here we go the China Light Industry Council

230
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,351
And the China household Electric Appliance Research Institute

231
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
They have released a white paper

232
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,215
Tell you about nb-iot in the smart

233
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
And the cool thing to note there

234
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,591
Kevin Bob is that there

235
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:55,199
Choosing nb-iot over Wi-Fi which is interesting to me

236
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,015
They're saying we're going nb-iot because

237
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:03,647
Lower power consumption wide area coverage and low cause I all of which I agree with but I wonder

238
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Why

239
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
Because

240
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
And I don't know is

241
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,791
Broadband penetration in China very low and therefore people don't have

242
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
Home netwerks and therefore WiFi

243
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:17,215
I don't want my appliances connected to a wide area network but maybe there's a good reason in China for this I do not know

244
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,007
It's a really good question

245
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
When I think about you

246
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,103
What's so I'm like having your stuff all connected

247
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Dwyer is at work

248
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Easier to

249
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,943
Control4 in circle

250
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,551
And it's probably better for the manufacturer's because one of the big challenges with

251
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,111
Connected appliances today is most people don't actually connect

252
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,439
Connecting a device like a washing machine to Wi-Fi is actually for

253
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,255
Pretty hard for most consumers one because they're like

254
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
What do I need to say

255
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
Which is totally legit

256
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,351
Question

257
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,935
Even though you just answered it how much time is left on the dryer

258
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Or

259
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,775
They've got it download the app on their phone and that's irritating

260
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,567
Coyote

261
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Some of those

262
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,151
Especially if your vendor

263
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:02,271
Paid for the connection because they get a benefit of saying I owe this about the breaker hey you need a new filter

264
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
Do you want to buy one now

265
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
So there are reasons

266
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
To do it but

267
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
It does feel like

268
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
That's ask

269
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,559
The surveillance thing which I don't disagree with your comment but I'd like to they really want to know when I'm frying Foods when I should be baking them I don't know

270
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,143
Think about things like controlling power

271
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
Lake

272
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,263
What if I think about this is water such an issue in my neighborhood

273
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,311
Neighborwho like

274
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
Runs the sprinkler on off

275
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,943
Off days what if your ration power like we ration water and

276
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,759
Sprinkler system or sprinkler with telling you

277
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,807
Be like hahaha you can't run now

278
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:41,695
Ratted out by the water company

279
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,023
We live in a freaking desert and we're in a drought what are you doing

280
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
It's not just you

281
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,239
These guys are doing is they're trying to

282
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
Set standards

283
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
In connectivity

284
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Aren't we all

285
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Did we do need it

286
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,407
But also in human machine interfaces

287
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
And the cloud computing

288
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
So from 2017 to 2019

289
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
They're going to

290
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
Create

291
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,159
Standards in organizations for smart Manufacturing

292
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
From 2019 to 2022

293
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,767
They're going to create the smart home use

294
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Standards

295
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,351
And then from 2022 to 2025

296
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,423
They are going to plan for those things to eat

297
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
Actually used

298
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
In the smartphone

299
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
So I think this is a good

300
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Perspective like

301
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,847
Hey let's start with manufacturing let's get that

302
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,895
And then when children place then we'll set the stage

303
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
Smart home and they will actually like

304
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
All

305
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
That's not a crazy

306
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
That is

307
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Hope that's only part of the

308
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
Here yes

309
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Is there other companies

310
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
In China

311
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
Where am I

312
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,607
They are working together on iot and Ai and by they I mean

313
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
Baidu and

314
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Xiaomi

315
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:01,055
Which if you're not familiar with Baidu is like I can search the Google of China quite honestly I think it has over 75%

316
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
Sent market share and search there in China

317
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:09,503
And Jeremy is one of the largest handset Sellers and manufacturers in China you can get some of those phones

318
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
Outside of China

319
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:16,927
We don't seem too much here in the u.s. not much detail here it's just an announcement that was made at

320
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
Xiaomi's first developer conference in Beijing

321
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,791
Just saying that these two are going to start working together

322
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
Don't know what

323
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
Are we going to

324
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Do yet

325
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,911
I know by do does have like a

326
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
Voice control

327
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,847
OS called do OS so that's available in some of those yummy Harbor you can buy today so maybe they're going to interview

328
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,431
Great that with whatever they can with Baidu I do not know what

329
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
It'll be interesting to watch

330
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,527
Because this is going to be the big coyote

331
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,087
AI movement that we've seen here

332
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
Over in China these two large companies

333
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,719
Yes and Shelby has a big Smart Home

334
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,535
Effort they make outlets and

335
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Bose outlet

336
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
But I bet there

337
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
So

338
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
We're keeping an eye on

339
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,079
Yeah they work with Smart TVs smart watches and all that as well home appliances

340
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
Baidu

341
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,527
Hopefully they will be better at it than Google by the way you guys the Google pixel buds that I got

342
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
My back

343
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
Not a fan

344
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
Too much

345
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,415
I didn't see anybody who was a fan unfortunately

346
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,719
I read a lot of battery is messed disappointing

347
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Google

348
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Come on

349
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
Okay

350
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,399
To a really cool story about Sensor Fusion

351
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,471
PID of Sensor Fusion is you take data from

352
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:38,079
Multiple different sensors use algorithms and you get different data that's even better

353
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
Pretty cool concept

354
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
This is

355
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,943
Kind of like that I guess it's not technically sensor

356
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,087
Fusion it is using cell signal so the performance of your cellular network to detect

357
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
Weather so

358
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,415
This is a way to detect

359
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,487
Weather more accurately without buying

360
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
Moore weather station

361
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:03,935
I already have tons of sensors and radar and so on and so forth I thought this was an interesting Twist on

362
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,471
No leveraging

363
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,079
Traditional technology that we already have the cellular networks themselves to actually

364
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
Improve weather at a local level and it's climacell which is a boston-based weather company they raised 15 million Siri

365
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,831
Is a funding and again no sensors or anything else

366
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:27,231
Measure how weather is impacted by wireless communication networks therefore you can use that information to

367
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
Get more accurate

368
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
Detailed weather app

369
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Look alive

370
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,143
Which is awesome and that reminds me if there's a company from Israel called

371
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
Breezometer

372
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
I've heard about them a cup

373
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
X

374
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,007
They actually use a measure

375
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:45,407
Weather patterns and then they use existing weather sensors but they're using like crazy events climatological

376
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Models

377
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,247
To predict whether locally without using more sensors

378
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,783
So this is actually

379
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
Tide of a trend

380
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,367
I'm probably the smart one because

381
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
Maybe we

382
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,207
Have the data we need we just need different algorithms

383
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:04,607
To get to it as opposed to like spending more on sensors which are awesome but you don't require maintenance

384
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Car batteries

385
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
Require all kinds of other things

386
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
So

387
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,495
It is there's a third piece to the weather aspect

388
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
It's not covered by this company but

389
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:18,687
Crowdsourcing and that's how I get my weather actually through an app called dark sky and it's uncannily accurate because they will tell me

390
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
Rain is starting in 7 minutes

391
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:25,087
And I show people that when I'm out of an event or something like that or bundle up or get your umbrella out

392
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Turn off

393
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
Almost to the minute

394
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,695
The rain starts falling it's really impressive

395
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:34,303
Yes I feel like there's a thermostat company that's actually working with

396
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,119
Either dark sky or another crowdsource weather app

397
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,447
Weather underground or somebody

398
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
Now only I could remember the thermos

399
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
But it's actually a really cool story

400
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,103
So the pointier crowdsource

401
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Sensor Fusion

402
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
And

403
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Algorithms

404
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
West Ada

405
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Making lives better

406
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
But maybe not as a

407
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
Who's a good tagline

408
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:03,231
What is the inevitable decline of the hype phase of

409
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Iot

410
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
I should have mentioned this

411
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,095
While back but a company called emberlight

412
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
They need smart sockets

413
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
So smart light sockets

414
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
And possibly

415
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
Stopped selling

416
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
They decided to shut

417
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,127
Don't they couldn't make it in the market

418
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,407
Which

419
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
Cool product but they were like

420
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
It's too competitive

421
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Too much

422
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,879
We're shutting down so they have a cloud service so there light bulbs will continue to work for

423
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
Three to four months

424
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
And then

425
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
They won't

426
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:41,119
Yeah that's this gets back to what happened to every buying Harbor service and in this case

427
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:46,751
The service is going to stop working unless somebody wants to pick it up open source somehow or whatever

428
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
This was actually a Kickstarter

429
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
Project

430
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,103
It was and I would say

431
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,687
It's not if you're buying a hardware or a service product I think

432
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,479
You are buying a service product

433
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,831
You have to recognize that there is an inevitable service product

434
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
Associated with these things

435
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
Maybe we hadn't really

436
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Recognize before

437
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,719
What I asked a question knowing the answer

438
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
You're right

439
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,303
Absolutely but I asked it's the people think about it

440
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
If you guys I think

441
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,703
Yeah so also and other lighting

442
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
Stack lighting

443
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Which

444
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,591
This is really disappointing and my friend Richard our friend Richard Gunther

445
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,407
Who's over at the home on podcast

446
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,711
And the digital media Zone actually reported

447
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Is first so kudos to him

448
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
But Staffing

449
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,623
They've gotten out of the consumer lighting business they sold their bulbs

450
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Looks like

451
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,975
They are now moving into the managed

452
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,767
Aging-in-place managed Beijing

453
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
Care

454
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
World where

455
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
It makes total sense

456
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:48,447
They have built algorithms that understand where people are in a room

457
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,287
Yeah based on sensors in the light bulbs and

458
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:56,895
Vacancy basically oh grandma got out of bed this morning awesome so it's less intrusive

459
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,223
Our people feel that is less intrusive because it's not a camera

460
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,807
So it makes a lot of sense but it's also an indication that

461
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
My God don't feel typo

462
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,927
Well there's just so many players in that space right now

463
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,511
Honestly I mean not you could probably name 10 light bulb companies off top of your head

464
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:17,119
I'm sure really need that many I mean up competitions great I get that

465
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
But really do we need that many

466
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,799
Well in the challenge also with lightbulbs is these are when to replace your light bulbs

467
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:29,663
They're supposed to 11 if you got LEDs. Going to last for a long time and it's really hard like with me

468
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
Paying another fifty bucks for

469
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,807
Better Greens in my Philips Hue color lights I was like

470
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Not worth it

471
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:44,511
I would say there is a sengled is a lighting company that seems to have this that has they make bulbs that

472
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,143
Meatballs with different functionalities built-in domes that someone has speakers some of them have IR for security some of them have

473
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,935
Cameras it's very interesting

474
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
But they keep them pretty cheap

475
00:19:53,983 --> 00:20:00,127
And what's interesting there is there model is that you will spend you know 12 to 15 bucks and a light bulb that's connected and

476
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,199
Then in a couple years you'll be like yeah you know what I need a different personality

477
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
Let's try this

478
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
I don't know I don't know

479
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,831
No I I don't think it will personally but

480
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Good luck

481
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:16,255
If it does seem happy for them I just don't see it I mean I'm a one-and-done shopping when it comes to light bulbs

482
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,559
I think getting people dragging their mind here is going to be

483
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,631
Tough So Good by Amber light

484
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
I stack you had

485
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,471
What stat to be clear is pivoting

486
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
Who's Ember lights they were

487
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,919
In retail stores

488
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,991
These are legit companies that made real products that actually work

489
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
It's hard out there man

490
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
All right

491
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,903
Lettuce

492
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,463
My holiday Peru tip from Stacy

493
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
Okay that's a terribly nice

494
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,583
Reading music for that

495
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
We do need music

496
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
For my holiday

497
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,727
I for the fourth year in running have

498
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,287
Pulled out all of my Christmas lights and

499
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Connected them with

500
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
Various

501
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,151
Some of the Mercedes some of them are Z-Wave and some of them are Wi-Fi out

502
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,247
But my pro-tip to you is for your outdoor lights

503
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
Label

504
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
Your Outlets

505
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,343
So I take a giant

506
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
I'm using a

507
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
Silver glitter pen

508
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,696
Because that's what I had on hand

509
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,280
But you can also just stick a piece of tape on it and label it on the tape if you don't want to

510
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
Put silver

511
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,632
Glitter ink on your house

512
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,704
So I have upper balcony I have

513
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,984
Snow witch

514
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,288
I have a snow lamp that shoots out like

515
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,336
Pretty snow patterns on the garage

516
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
I have a

517
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,504
Roof and I think I have a little balcony and then I have my eye twinkle lights so all of those are permanently

518
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,904
Is labeled so I can just pull them out and put them in the right spot which is awesome it saved me like an extra 20 minutes cuz usually what I did

519
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
It is I have to

520
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,464
Hook them up to my Z-Wave stuff

521
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
Jeffrey hook them up

522
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,328
You don't spend the time figuring out which Outlet

523
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
Work

524
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,168
So that is my Pro tip

525
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,704
Name your

526
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,984
Holiday lighting

527
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
To something it can't even be kind of generic

528
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,872
But just give each one a name and stick with it

529
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
That name on the outlet

530
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
How to make it easy for

531
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
Good idea

532
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
That's my Pro tip

533
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,320
My other pro-tip is guys

534
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,856
Amazon Echo

535
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,952
When do you group things into a room like turn lights on at cetera

536
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,512
Does recognize now the Lutron

537
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:31,168
Which is awesome except for two of my Lutron lights are ceiling fans and so now whenever I turn my lights on my ceiling fans

538
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
Turn on soap

539
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
How to ungroup at

540
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,776
And that is also information you guys might

541
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
A neutron

542
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,760
Kind of a bummer because I really just wanted to be like turn on fan

543
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
What it's like

544
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
That's a light

545
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:54,976
Cuz we have stupid names for advanced we call it our downstairs when is big fan or if there's one is Master fan

546
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:59,328
I always forget you know my turn on the fan is like there are several things share that name

547
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
I get the same thing

548
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:08,032
With the certain lights are rooms and whatnot so I want to get away from the whole names thing let's have some contacts in here and you know

549
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
Screen on the contacts

550
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
But let's make it the right time

551
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
Cuz that is going to light switch

552
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Okay

553
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,992
Let us move to the iot podcast listener hotline

554
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,528
Which is brought to you by Schlage

555
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
Maker of electronic lock

556
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:26,720
Schlage smart locks work with most Smart Home & Security system so you can get the most out of your lock whether you're an Apple homekit user are you

557
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
Madam

558
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,584
To see what's possible visit schlage.com to learn more

559
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,656
Adhere I'm going to warn you guys this is a

560
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,192
Good question that is

561
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,216
Given to us

562
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
Bye

563
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,520
A speech to

564
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,080
A text to speech robot baby what do you think

565
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,408
How many grams

566
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
This is not an act

567
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
Maybe a good reason for that

568
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,576
I believe strongly there is a human

569
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
Did actually ask this

570
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
Stacey and Kevin

571
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,256
I'm calling on behalf of Michael from Brisbane

572
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Australia

573
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,840
Announce the bridge to provide High

574
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,640
Have you heard anything from Belkin recently regarding me my timesheet

575
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
Compatibility

576
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,576
Like it will come out on December 4th

577
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
But

578
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
Kevin

579
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,816
Yeah well for folks who are not familiar with the actual details Belkin actually announced back in May that

580
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,912
WeMo devices would be homekit compatible through a WeMo Bridge

581
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:42,240
Piece of Hardware that I don't want another bridge but okay I get it

582
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,544
The reason was because Home Care

583
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,592
Required hardware certification

584
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:50,432
An actual implementation of a security chip however that has changed

585
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:56,576
Apple now that does not require they can do it on the software side so I suspect Michael that the WeMo Bridge

586
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,392
Will never come to pass which is fine by me

587
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
Unfortunately

588
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,976
Dokkan hasn't announced anything yet

589
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,280
In terms of this so I don't know

590
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Really

591
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,352
When they're going to I presume

592
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:14,752
That CES in January which they singing I will both be attending and we will certainly be talking to the Dunkin folks and visiting the

593
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,776
WeMo area

594
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
Dad

595
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,640
Maybe that's the time that they announced it I can't see if they haven't announced it by now

596
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
I suspect CES is really good

597
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,968
The big thing the time in place so

598
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:28,320
Hopefully the second week of January we will have a definitive answer for you

599
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:33,696
I hope it is not a bridge I hope it is something they can do on the software side and just make it sew

600
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
Yes I'm actually

601
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,512
Because the homepod

602
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:41,120
Was the Apple homepod was delayed until early 2018

603
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,192
I'm actually hoping we see a lot of really cool announcement

604
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,216
At CES

605
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
Even though Apple.

606
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
Historically

607
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,568
They don't go I'm hoping we see a lot

608
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:55,968
Partners or hear from people that this is going to happen like I hope the homekit ecosystem coalesces

609
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
Sometime after that

610
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:01,344
Because right now it's not as compelling or as rich as some of the other things and

611
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,904
Are other options out there and I think that's a real shame

612
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
Because

613
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,952
Yeah and

614
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:11,584
Just looking back at prior CES is a lot of the announcements have been we're going to have this it will

615
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,608
Come this year

616
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,704
I think we're at the point now where you will see more actual

617
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,264
Implementations and products are available

618
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
Like immediately or

619
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,104
Student not sometime next year we're going to have

620
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,152
That's so that's my hope Michael that

621
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,968
Belkin says we got it as of today

622
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Boom

623
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,784
Yeah I would like it is past time

624
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
Together

625
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Poop or get off the

626
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
That's what I said

627
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,648
You did you went there

628
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,952
I went there because I am so frustrated

629
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
Now

630
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,000
After that

631
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
I feel like we should take

632
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
A moment

633
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,400
For a word from our sponsor and then after that stay tuned for

634
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,448
The internet of battle

635
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,008
How we are going to connect

636
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,080
All of our robots are drones are soldiers are sensors

637
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:58,432
To create the battlefield of the future this is a fun conversation I had with

638
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:05,088
Someone from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign so stay tuned for that oh and before I go I just want to remind

639
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:11,488
Everybody that Thursday that is actually today Thursday November 30th if you're listening to the podcast in the day

640
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,560
Andrew in San Francisco

641
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
Target

642
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:20,448
Open house and we are going to be talking about business models for The Internet of Things

643
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,032
You kind of want to go if you're in town because you know

644
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:28,640
It'll be a cool conversation and you can meet me or you can watch it live streams on Facebook

645
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,688
And I'll be sharing a link for that

646
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,736
And that's the one across from Moscone Center

647
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,600
Cool gadgets

648
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:44,256
And now a word from our sponsor hey everyone we are interrupting

649
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:50,656
Message from our sponsor sponsor is sparkcognition I have here fellow

650
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Sparkcognition

651
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,960
To talk about

652
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,752
The Pie vs Bill deliver

653
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,544
Implementing a AI in

654
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:02,944
Many companies have internal data teams and they're looking to implement a machine-learning solution internally

655
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,504
What are some of the factors they should consider

656
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
In doing this

657
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,856
Your first question typically comes from the executive

658
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,416
What is the company's core competency

659
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,208
And how is a line

660
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
With the idea

661
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Building a team

662
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,328
How to create cognitive analytic Solutions in house

663
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,608
Another aspect

664
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,912
When you assess what is it

665
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
Strategy required

666
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,728
For me long term

667
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,800
And how far can you really go in here

668
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,104
Thinking about implementing machine learning

669
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
Solutions

670
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Seems to be

671
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,432
Speedy attractive at first

672
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,224
Then you realize it is sex

673
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,016
She just the tip of the iceberg

674
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,344
If you try to build a cognitive solutions that is it

675
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
Scalable

676
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,976
And finally implemented it starts

677
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:51,328
With executive team sponsorship it propagates throughout the stakeholders

678
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:55,168
So what advantages and services can an external vendor provide

679
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,752
One an AI company like spark ignition

680
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:02,848
Has tested and evaluated existing and available tools

681
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872
Algorithms

682
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,944
Techniques that are in the market or any research

683
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,736
Knowing the best product

684
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:14,368
And having access to the right tools can make a significant difference in how long

685
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:19,488
It takes to complete unused case application sometime to value is one Bennett

686
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,280
Second computing

687
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
Middleware platform

688
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,608
OS algorithm

689
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
Continue to evolve

690
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
In change

691
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,984
Rapidly maintaining and upgrading applications

692
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,312
Quickly become a bottleneck so we that long-term

693
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,152
Court is a great benefit from vendors that are specialized

694
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,760
And finally that was argued that vendors are exposed like no one else

695
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
2 hundreds of used case

696
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
And this know that

697
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
Out of the box

698
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,720
Is extremely beneficial when leveraging that knowledge to support a particular client

699
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,768
So what would a partnership look

700
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
Like what does

701
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,376
The internal and external team which responsibilities would they have

702
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
So I would like to

703
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,936
Start saying that we becoming

704
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,240
Ascension of our clients capabilities

705
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
Distance to engage

706
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
On the pilot project refers to

707
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,128
Agreed on a success criteria

708
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,176
LC's ability for the project

709
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
Then we break

710
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,480
Project introduced

711
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,552
Specific and manageable Milestones that both sides

712
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,320
Quiet

713
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,112
In our teams can understand

714
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,160
Influence and drive

715
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,184
In summary

716
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:25,024
The internal team on the client side will provide us

717
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
Subject matter X

718
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,352
Richie's to fine-tune Diablo

719
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,888
Vacation

720
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,216
Define the usability of

721
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,008
And that is actually

722
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,056
Critical because Ximena cases

723
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,592
The same application

724
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,152
Will be used by different parts

725
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,968
Organization on the client side

726
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:49,088
We will do the end-to-end effort to do project management

727
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,160
Will do data ingestion where do dashboards

728
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
And we do the final deployment

729
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,232
Follow the sounds great

730
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,024
Where can I go to find out

731
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:03,680
You can look at our website for cognition. Com

732
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:10,080
Hey everyone welcome back to the inter

733
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:16,480
Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacy and today's guest is

734
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,016
Professor Oak

735
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
Shooter science

736
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,088
At the University of Illinois

737
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,392
And we are talking about the battlefield

738
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
Future

739
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,352
Can you show me and I am super excited

740
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,144
But let's break this down

741
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,704
Alright so you guys recently won

742
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,776
Grant from the Army research lab for

743
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
Helping develop

744
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,848
Battlefield of the future look like

745
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,896
Vision for this

746
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
Game from

747
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,016
Cheer. Concern in the future

748
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
The US

749
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,808
My face

750
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
Adverse

751
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
And after college

752
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
Need to be ready

753
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,328
Technology Warehouse

754
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,144
Cr1tikal logically Advanced 1

755
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,912
Will

756
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
Net worth all the answers

757
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
Add that well

758
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
Allow them

759
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
To work dynamis

760
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,592
Intelligent player

761
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,360
Mission

762
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,128
Without

763
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:22,272
Okay so I have so many questions because

764
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,808
The stuff of science-fiction

765
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
Is the ID

766
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
In the future

767
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:31,232
We're going to just send out drones

768
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,024
Fight for us

769
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,376
I think the idea is that we want to really put the people out of Harm's Way

770
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,680
If that is something that we can do with robot

771
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,216
We should definitely do it with it open

772
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:45,312
Not everything we can do it all by example

773
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
Issues

774
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
In this project

775
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,896
Is BattleBots shalt not kill

776
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
Without

777
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,456
Somebody has

778
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,296
But there are many other function

779
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
And the question

780
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
To what degree we can push the economy

781
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:03,488
How practical that is how safe that is how ethical

782
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
Intelligence

783
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,352
Turn into septic safe

784
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,192
Okay so today

785
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,616
And then we also use drones extensively

786
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
And so

787
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,920
What changes

788
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
Are we

789
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,736
For this project

790
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,784
Because I feel like we already use a lot of

791
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,648
Definitely.

792
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,184
And in fact

793
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,232
Idea of the

794
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,512
Filled up

795
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,304
Future P&G net worth

796
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,632
Leverages what the US is already liquid

797
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
We are in fact

798
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
Good act automation

799
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,472
We are in fact

800
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
Artificial intelligence

801
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,800
And this takes it to the next step

802
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,592
We want to Network all the

803
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,896
Did not individual entity

804
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,432
That are working

805
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,712
Southside controls

806
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
Individuals now we want to see

807
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,272
Think of them as

808
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
Beast 2000

809
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
All Phase

810
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,368
Cinco distributed

811
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
And perhaps the analogy that comes to mind

812
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,976
Yes with Transformers from the

813
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
Transformers

814
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
We have that thing

815
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,816
Shapes into whatever you tell it to

816
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Except

817
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
Hear it filter

818
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,680
CVS at little

819
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
Digital component

820
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,752
But they work together as a

821
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,056
Joint Commission

822
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,592
Activision

823
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
Intelligent

824
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
It has to

825
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,480
Think on its own how to accomplish it

826
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248
Mission

827
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,552
It should not be micromanaged

828
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,624
I don't want to tell all the Thousand Parts what to do

829
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:38,208
I want to be able to tell that in Seattle what to do

830
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
And it should be able to

831
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,792
Figured out how to do it somehow

832
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,072
Distribute the jobs

833
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,656
Now the individual Parts could be anything

834
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
Could be the armor

835
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,216
The people wear

836
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,752
Is the weapons themselves

837
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,800
It could be very dangerous

838
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Krispy Kreme

839
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Mobile

840
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
Golang

841
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,896
It could be sensors that

842
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
Deliver information

843
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,968
It would be even algorithm

844
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
AI search

845
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
Components all of these

846
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,600
Net worth together all of these are part of the mission part of that

847
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,208
OKC that sounds more like Voltron as opposed to a Transformer

848
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,328
This is not an 80s

849
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,608
Cartoon show this is

850
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
Real life

851
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
When you say things

852
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,032
Might work in conjunction

853
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
Which information

854
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:30,944
For my drone can you put me in a bind

855
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,528
Commanding the battle

856
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:38,368
This could be one of the types of missions

857
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,160
Is a Tax Commission

858
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
Disaster Response

859
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,464
Mission

860
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
Lots of recent hurricanes

861
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
Endorse definition

862
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,072
First environment is hot

863
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,120
What deity denies

864
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,704
Team of machines and sensors

865
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,984
Going fine

866
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
Survivor

867
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,288
Stay in the aftermath

868
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,056
Hurricane

869
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
Find out there

870
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,616
Where they are

871
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,664
Accessible they are what is

872
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,944
The best way to

873
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
Come and get them

874
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
Perhaps

875
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
Steven Universe

876
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,296
First state to them

877
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,320
Until

878
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
If you want help comes in

879
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,880
Now to do that

880
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:15,232
Configure in the right answers how elegant

881
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,280
When you do

882
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,096
Park when you took her house

883
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,376
Configure Linksys

884
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,424
Computer supplies we as a

885
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
Battlefield Commander

886
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,800
I don't want to have to make those decisions myself

887
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
Sense8

888
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,872
See your face answers and 5

889
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,408
I want to leave that

890
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
Decision to Maya

891
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,504
Palace Mayan

892
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
My intent

893
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,552
Is 2 safe

894
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,832
For example survivors

895
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Gulf Pointe

896
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,392
Rescue them

897
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
The machine

898
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,720
Quit be able to understand what that's

899
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,304
Sensory devices in terms of actuation

900
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,168
To be considered

901
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
And they would go

902
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Do it

903
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
They can eat

904
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
Give me some status updates

905
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
I made

906
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,824
Manage them but at the high level

907
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,128
Okay so in this idea

908
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:10,528
I feel like a couple of possible weak links so one is right now

909
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,296
4

910
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,576
Connected devices

911
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,392
In all honesty and update

912
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,440
Crack them all the time

913
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,488
Peps Lake

914
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,328
I have to do is go to war with someone who's really good at computers and

915
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,912
System

916
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,776
Resilient and then also is aware that

917
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,336
This is a wonderful question

918
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,128
And in fact this is

919
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,408
Exactly why we need

920
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
To be informed

921
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
Research project

922
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,808
Deployment exercise

923
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
Security integrators questions

924
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Alien

925
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,232
Ask question

926
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,536
Safety and that's why

927
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,352
That's why we have 10 years

928
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,888
Play Century figure

929
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,424
Indeed

930
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,240
Security is one of the main source in the

931
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,544
Everything we do has to be

932
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,336
Your everything we do has

933
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,616
Safe has to be

934
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Brazilian

935
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,432
It has to operate in a very hot

936
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,992
One of the ways that this is

937
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,272
Is different from

938
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,600
Similar Technologies for the internet of things that are

939
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
You was in

940
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,928
Civilian life is that we are operating

941
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
Demanding

942
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
Break up

943
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
Is it going to rain

944
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
Infiltrate

945
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,120
Components

946
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
Indication

947
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,192
How do we face that has one

948
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,336
Let's talk about how to break that up because I think there's some

949
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,360
Obviously

950
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:45,760
Right now one of the big thing is you know cracking various protocols

951
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,344
Electronic

952
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,440
Components that actually perhaps

953
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,512
Do as much manufacturing of our electronic

954
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,280
Components

955
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,096
That we can actually control so I'm curious what you

956
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,632
You guys are thinking about the

957
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:06,240
What one of the very interesting aspects of a project is that division

958
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
Conan

959
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,824
I'm not entirely Trust

960
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
Not all the components

961
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,408
Other

962
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,944
Not over components

963
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,344
Yeah some of the components perhaps a drastic but some of the components are what we called grey components or even drive component

964
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,416
Gray is where you don't quite know

965
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,696
You should trust this

966
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,744
Rather sweater is actually

967
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,768
Maybe DeLong

968
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:32,096
Does animated mean when I see if you can somehow

969
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,632
Exact value of it anyway

970
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,448
But the point is

971
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
We do not

972
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,336
Are all 100%.

973
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
Supportive

974
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
Security

975
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:49,504
The mechanisms that allow you to pretty quickly

976
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,856
Power components that are not doing what they're supposed to work.

977
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
May have been in

978
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,696
And eliminate them or isolate them

979
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
What is that prevent

980
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,768
These components

981
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,120
What do we learn from technologies that are already out there about

982
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,144
Security cameras

983
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
Especially when it comes to things

984
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
Using machine learning

985
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,240
Do detect

986
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,104
Security

987
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
Stanton in network

988
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,664
Is a heart problem

989
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
Clearly the more components

990
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,224
What's internet work

991
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
Told me she was at all this

992
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,320
Components

993
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
Palestine is bad

994
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
Sometimes

995
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,184
There is benefits

996
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,232
The more components you have

997
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,512
More

998
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,560
How to be resilient

999
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:38,400
Because even if some of the components go bad

1000
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Compensate

1001
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,704
I think one of the

1002
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,288
Get network

1003
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
More

1004
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,360
The enemy will have to go and

1005
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,432
Hawaii is one of those to get to the other

1006
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
However

1007
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,736
Resilience mechanism

1008
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,760
Are in place

1009
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,552
Evil twin

1010
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,600
Really clear despondent isolate

1011
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,880
Then that's it

1012
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,648
Mitigated

1013
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,440
The other part is we

1014
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,744
To make sure that

1015
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
TSM

1016
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
And I think that

1017
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,328
One of the

1018
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,608
Critical lesson

1019
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
Trump

1020
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
What I want to call the field of

1021
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
Cyber-physical

1022
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
So the physical world

1023
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,848
Subway's learn how to

1024
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,872
To build for example

1025
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Plane

1026
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,920
Passenger airline

1027
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,456
Computer operator

1028
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,016
Be safe of course that I asked

1029
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,808
Spent a lot of the time

1030
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
We can learn from that

1031
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,928
One of the

1032
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,208
Cheaper happy

1033
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Lesson

1034
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,536
Is this skillet

1035
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,304
Allows this

1036
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,352
To build systems.

1037
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:44,192
Continue to operate correctly even when a part of this

1038
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,728
System has been compromised

1039
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,008
This is something that

1040
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
Need for a lot of things

1041
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,336
Automated systems like economist

1042
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
Plane

1043
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,640
Autopilot

1044
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,687
And I think we can chat about along for the bathroom

1045
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,991
Because components will be compromised

1046
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,783
Distance have to operate with those things

1047
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
Components will be shot.

1048
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,975
This is Denise to be engineered in such a way that at our age.

1049
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,559
I agree and hopefully some of this will apply back out to

1050
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,095
Commercial projects

1051
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:17,727
Connection factories in other autonomous systems that we're trying to build today in real life

1052
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,799
I do believe that some of the lessons

1053
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
Let's learn from the

1054
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
Project

1055
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,639
Chucky be applicable to

1056
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
Industrial demand

1057
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,199
Disability application

1058
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:33,087
Let's get a little deep into this because you did also mention ethics

1059
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,879
And I imagine that's associated with

1060
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,647
With soldiers

1061
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,951
With the button which is already happening today

1062
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,231
It's some level

1063
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,303
The idea of sending drones

1064
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,119
Robots

1065
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,191
There's an economic cost but part of the horror

1066
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,727
Deterrent

1067
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:53,823
Against War has always been the high cost

1068
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,407
So I'm curious what it means

1069
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,943
As we automate

1070
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
War

1071
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,039
That's a wonderful question I said

1072
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,831
IID Electric bill

1073
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,623
Think of it that way

1074
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,159
If we don't do it

1075
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
And others

1076
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,463
Do it with Whitby

1077
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,231
In good shape

1078
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,255
My guess

1079
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,303
She's not we will not be in good shape

1080
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:19,167
The question is do what degree do we want to push in an hour and I think

1081
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,727
There is an important role of for ethics

1082
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,751
Here and in fact

1083
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,519
We do have

1084
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,847
I'm looking at hotels at 6

1085
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,639
Design and that's the practice

1086
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:32,223
That is done in many larger project because a lot of them

1087
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,247
Design decisions

1088
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
Do

1089
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,831
Beautification somehow

1090
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
The product

1091
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,391
What is enable

1092
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
What's the weather

1093
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
OpenTable

1094
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
Empowering

1095
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,303
What we want to happen or not

1096
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
I think

1097
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,887
We need to think through the implications of what it means

1098
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,167
Install Network things

1099
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,263
Delegate certain decision

1100
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
And

1101
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,335
What's a machine

1102
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,407
Should follow as far as ethical code

1103
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,967
When I make a decision I make it

1104
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,503
In accordance with Lauren

1105
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
In accordance

1106
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
Ethics

1107
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
In accordance with

1108
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,087
With knowledge that I have

1109
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
Make me laugh

1110
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,135
Well

1111
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,903
Wicked

1112
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,695
Impart that knowledge on the machine

1113
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,487
But we also them

1114
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,023
Make the machine

1115
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,303
Stan's the Lost

1116
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
I think it's

1117
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,167
Wonderful design problem

1118
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,447
It's something that's

1119
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
Bridges

1120
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,495
Is the technical

1121
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,055
And the social and ethical and illegal

1122
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,591
And we need to make it

1123
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
Safe

1124
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,151
We need to make sure that the machine

1125
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
The knot

1126
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,967
Perpetrator fences

1127
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
Got

1128
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,295
Be liable for in a bad way they're not going to go kids

1129
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,599
Another question

1130
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,879
Tied to the ethics

1131
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
Is

1132
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,951
Right now if we look at what's happening

1133
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,999
With fighting in Syria for example

1134
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,071
What you see a lot of is civilians

1135
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:51,839
Are left

1136
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:56,447
And what becomes interesting to me is this idea of we have our robots fight

1137
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,543
Worse for us it feels like a lot of civilians could be

1138
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,311
Caught in the

1139
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
Crossfire

1140
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,103
Quite literally

1141
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
I don't know if

1142
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:10,527
We're really thinking about so I am curious kind of how you guys think about that are also

1143
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,807
Not actually about

1144
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:12,831
Their cities

1145
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,599
Jen homes

1146
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,367
Neighborhood

1147
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,695
I think what you said is one of the important motivation

1148
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,047
Theaters of operation if you will Insidious

1149
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,839
Most people

1150
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,863
Today live in City

1151
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,423
Future Wars will increasingly be in

1152
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,239
It's pretty hard.

1153
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
To fight a war

1154
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
He damaged

1155
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,687
Collateral damage right now is

1156
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,223
Huge problem

1157
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,527
Say something

1158
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
We cannot improve

1159
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,343
Idea is

1160
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,111
Is that

1161
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
If we have Smart than welcome

1162
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,183
Maybe they can if

1163
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:55,071
Tell your story and this happened to a friend of mine so they

1164
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,887
They were driving across the bridge

1165
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
And there was a fight

1166
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,983
Any fire and fighter jet

1167
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,775
Flew over the bridge

1168
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,567
And I circled circled again

1169
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,615
Until my friend got off the bridge

1170
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,663
Just driving around

1171
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,943
And then that just

1172
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,295
Saved my friend's life

1173
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
Gateway to the

1174
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,855
Away

1175
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,391
Now today we have

1176
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:28,863
Maybe your check go there's nobody there so I can fly fly fly fly

1177
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,423
Civilian

1178
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,447
There's no way to stop it

1179
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,239
What is the Rockets

1180
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,775
Maybe the Rockets

1181
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,311
Until what that fighter

1182
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,335
Jet Pilot

1183
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
Little bit

1184
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,455
Jefferson

1185
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,271
My point is we tend to sing

1186
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,575
Bob's Market weapons

1187
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:51,135
More dangerous plants

1188
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
And that isn't it

1189
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951
To explore How can I

1190
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,231
Make war

1191
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,255
Safer

1192
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
For the civilian

1193
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,815
With less collateral damage

1194
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,119
So I think that is.

1195
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,191
Can we create an FAQ

1196
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,215
Environment

1197
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,751
Can we create system

1198
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,031
That was you just clap

1199
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,055
Damage to zero

1200
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
High School

1201
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,871
Try to

1202
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,967
Future and I think maybe with smarter Technologies

1203
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,295
And

1204
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,623
What about our military hardware is going

1205
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
Two places like

1206
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
Police

1207
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,463
Specifically

1208
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,743
Because last year

1209
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,791
In Dallas the Dallas Police

1210
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,327
We're faced with a shooter

1211
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,119
And they actually

1212
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,143
Parking garage

1213
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,935
And took a bomb disposal

1214
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,239
Robot and then

1215
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,335
Is weekly kind of

1216
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,895
I feel like there's a lot of questions

1217
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,199
Around something

1218
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:50,271
We have in the USA history of our military

1219
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,807
You're going to

1220
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,087
Police gear

1221
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,623
Can you set down the chain

1222
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
And

1223
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,439
Are we prepared for that as we

1224
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,207
Connect stuff

1225
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,487
Make it even smarter

1226
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,535
Maybe just a couple of things

1227
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,583
Things that I should mention one of them is.

1228
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,607
And this is a big

1229
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,631
IPhone 5S

1230
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,655
Project

1231
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,679
We are not

1232
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,751
I think that's an important

1233
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,031
Distinction to make because

1234
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,847
Robots fighting

1235
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,407
Weather

1236
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,223
Kill anybody unless I push the button

1237
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
What's the weather today

1238
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,295
How to make

1239
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,575
Vacuole function

1240
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,879
Is a completely different level

1241
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,927
And it's something that we are

1242
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,207
Not going to do it

1243
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,815
Now there are lots of other functions

1244
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,119
Example data

1245
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,655
You know I need

1246
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,239
Sensory data

1247
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,031
I want to deploy my sensors

1248
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,055
Somewhere where they can

1249
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,591
Can see the enemy and I want them

1250
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,127
Tell me what the enemy is doing

1251
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,663
I want them to report when

1252
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,431
Something happen

1253
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:53,247
Requires my attention I want them to

1254
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,295
To do that for the magically I want them to

1255
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,087
Automatically understand

1256
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,159
When the enemy is doing something that might

1257
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,719
Star. Delivery

1258
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,767
Function of those alerts

1259
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,535
Mason

1260
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
Is

1261
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,607
Lena Paul website

1262
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,167
Do Automation and Tool

1263
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,727
Splicing their intelligence and autonomy of them

1264
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,287
Worry about people

1265
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,639
Okay

1266
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:23,199
I have learned a lot

1267
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:29,599
I'm intrigued to see what we can learn from this project so thank you

1268
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,623
Very much for coming

1269
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,439
Thank you very much that was fun

1270
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:39,839
