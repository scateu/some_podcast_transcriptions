00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Hey everyone Welcome to The Intern

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,728
Turn out of things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:14,080
And this is our special CS edition of the podcast it is sponsored

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,360
Machineq

5
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,152
A Comcast company

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,480
So this past week Kevin and I were at CES that is

7
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,272
The Consumer Electronic Show

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,624
Weighs about a hundred and eighty thousand other people in Las Vegas

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,928
This your show the attendance

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,952
Seemed

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,976
Much

12
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,536
Much less than in previous years

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,888
Usually there's a lot more bottlenecks a lot more bodies on the show floor

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,168
Really

15
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:44,288
Both Kevin and I were kind of amazed that we could just walk around without much interference at all

16
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,640
I don't know what to make of that except for

17
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,968
Possibly might be a rocky 2019

18
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:58,368
We cover the news in some of our prior podcast but every year I'd like to bring out the show that we record at sea

19
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:02,464
CSN we asked attendees their thoughts in a little bit about why they are here

20
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,304
In this episode as I said is brought to you by machineq

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,192
Machine key with a Comcast company focused on iot in the global Enterprise B2B Market

22
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,080
Their iot platform includes best-in-class Lora based Gateway Hardware

23
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,640
Enterprise-grade management Cloud software

24
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:26,272
MSecure Wireless connectivity to help you easily create your own dedicated iot Network

25
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,112
This enables you to speed up Innovation and reduce time-to-market

26
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,208
You can learn more at www. Machineq

27
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Dot-com

28
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:40,096
So this year was actually the first year at CES for one of my interviewees

29
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,192
This was Mike nefkens who is the CEO of the newly-created

30
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
Resideo company

31
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
Resideo was created when Honeywell split out its consumer-facing businesses from its industrial commercial

32
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,968
Videomix thermostat that provides Home Security

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,064
It also makes the part sounds like inside your water heater HVAC

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
System

35
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,672
So Mike and I chatted about the changes happening in the Smart Home

36
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
PS plus March

37
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
I feel like a lot of things

38
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
We're like

39
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
Finally getting to where we

40
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
I've been saying we would be

41
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:22,592
Would you guys actually very curious

42
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128
Where you're going to sell

43
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,528
A lot going on in the smartphone market in what you said about incremental is right you know over the last 10 years people

44
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,904
Beverly adopted one single product at a time no one wakes up one day and said today I'm going to make my home smart

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
Now finally seeing companies that are

46
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
You know they have the platform

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
Act ability in the homes be able to now bring a lot of this together to really give you a smart home experience

48
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
Entertainment

49
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,848
And Beyond some of the basics

50
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
Pro Channel or a channel has finally caught up please be froze for typically screwdrivers and Ham

51
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648
And they Now understand basic networking

52
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,464
Make sure that these connected

53
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:17,632
Business model is going to look like both for you and for the dealers and service providers

54
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:24,032
Yes

55
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:30,432
Writer of call

56
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,784
We're hoping for sets at our products

57
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,184
So we can actually sell the product to the dealer as well as happy as our software

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,072
And other services I will actually charge a monthly fee or annual fee or whatever for certain services

59
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,704
A long time like nobody thinks about their water heater until it goes out

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
Replace every 3 years

61
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,384
So actually starts with technology into those things how are you changing

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,016
I think about warranties communicating with the customer hell on the supper last or even how you build it

63
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:25,215
Two or three weeks before it's going to go down if there's something wrong it will start to consume more energy or it will start to leave

64
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,615
Control unit connected an alert to yourself

65
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,431
Tractor

66
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:47,231
And what it means that you have to have a contractor's somebody

67
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
Signs your home

68
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
You know everybody every person

69
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
Has a general physician

70
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
Pro

71
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,871
Invisalign

72
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:14,111
What should the positions have with Lake Fitbit data or heart rate monitoring data because they don't

73
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:20,767
I don't actually want to be on the hook if something goes wrong

74
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
I'm serious about against liability

75
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
Let's say your water heater explodes and maybe our contractor missed that memo I don't know

76
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:43,295
We've done with combustion units where you have natural gas coming in with a flame so that's what we're here for and that's where

77
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,695
The contractor can team up with us and you know we'll make sure that these units are secure their safe

78
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,743
I will stand behind how they work

79
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,583
Another first timer at the show was Procter & Gamble

80
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,423
The company started building connected Tech back in 2015

81
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:05,567
And at this show they were showing off connected toothbrushes skincare products and a connected error

82
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
Freshener I spoke with

83
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,687
Thanh ha who is an R&D director for air care products

84
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
A P&G

85
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,039
About what they've learned selling connected devices to mainstream

86
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Consumers

87
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,623
And what connectivity offers PNG

88
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Cheese business

89
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,535
Okay I imagine all of you guys have heard of proctoring

90
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:31,423
Hair care products the last time I checked

91
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
Error

92
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,287
Freshener kind of system that was so long ago

93
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,615
And now this is her first year at CES So Tan

94
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
Why are you guys here

95
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
We have

96
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,247
So since you talked to his last we have developed

97
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
Autonomy technology

98
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
That really addresses consumer tension

99
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,903
So for example the product that mites

100
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,439
Team is here with this called

101
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,743
And what we learn from the

102
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,047
Fire Trine CSM

103
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,095
Home

104
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Product

105
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Technology

106
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
Self-control

107
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
Consumer

108
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,431
Because it was what space in terms of the

109
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
It didn't solve the biggest consumer tension

110
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
That people have

111
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
With continuous air

112
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,623
Air freshening products

113
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
Which is

114
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
Starts too strong

115
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,255
Goes through a period that's just right and then gets too weak

116
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,119
So with that in mind

117
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,911
What's the right

118
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Consistency

119
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
They want the exact same thing

120
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Burien

121
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,991
So after going through over 30 different

122
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
A-Z technology

123
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
Deliver this

124
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Consistency

125
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,463
Disconnectivity

126
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,767
It possible for you to use

127
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
The thermal inkjet

128
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:08,703
So we could have done it without conductivity

129
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
What what kind of activity does

130
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,871
Control example in our test

131
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
What we learn

132
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,199
Is over 95% of those

133
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
They love to schedule

134
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,087
That's what connectivity allows additional control

135
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,415
Is the delivery system that allows

136
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
Precision delivery

137
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,255
Connectivity allows that last layer of the control that the

138
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
People are sick

139
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,679
AIC schedule it through conductivity through the app

140
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,567
They're getting up getting ready for work or school

141
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
A few hours in the evening

142
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,151
Coralista after dinner

143
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
I'm home from work

144
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
Store hours on the weekend

145
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,343
And so that's what kind of activity allows and is amazing with the consumer

146
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,695
You guys have been experimenting with

147
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,631
What have you learned about making your products connected to the mainstream audience

148
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,447
Yeah I helped solve a problem

149
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,103
There's a quadruped probably smaller

150
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:24,479
That's kind of cool I'll buy it but for the mainstream I think it's like it's kind of help

151
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Either

152
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
Make the task easier

153
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111
Or improve experience like the app

154
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
To be in scheduling with area

155
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
I think that's what we've learned

156
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,999
And so as we look at all the different technology

157
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,095
The question we ask is how is this technology helped me implement

158
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Technology

159
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Really help solve it

160
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
No problem

161
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,031
In disconnectivity open up new avenues in the R&D Department

162
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:53,151
Oh hey choirs

163
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,735
Work experience

164
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
It what it does is it allows

165
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
Another layer of control

166
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
And so

167
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,999
The most obvious one in this Bay Area cases instead of running 24/7

168
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
Or having some

169
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
We determine what the schedule is

170
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
The product

171
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:29,247
If people can tell us what they like what they don't like and you know that you probably know with your other podcasts

172
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,343
Your people are very very open to providing feedback until that connectivity

173
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,903
Is actually a direct conduit to sub

174
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
Zoomer so we get a lot of input that way to

175
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
How are you guys

176
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,887
Bedding technology and everything

177
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,447
I feel like Technologies just going to become like

178
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
Right it's not going to be something that we

179
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,359
We think about her so how do we get there faster

180
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Because I think

181
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,967
Consumer Brands actually

182
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,879
How we do that is with product like area

183
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,695
Artists like the Gillette heated razor the Opti

184
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,767
Is new technology always comes out of

185
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
Price premium

186
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
Right so I think the

187
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,703
State to rush out there and try to implement

188
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,823
But just from an affordability and

189
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
No problem

190
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,175
But will be like for a POTUS like area

191
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
That required

192
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
Technology to solve

193
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
Adding conductivity

194
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
This will be a natural way to

195
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
More available in more home

196
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
As a steel drive there the cost will go down

197
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,583
Alright thank you so much time

198
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:54,239
Building a connected air freshener or adding connectivity to your operations can be hard

199
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:59,615
So let's turn to our show sponsor machine q and its CEO Alex Crum

200
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,919
To talk about how Enterprises

201
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,807
Even those who may not attend CES can adopt the iot without a lot of fuss

202
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,879
Alex Banks

203
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,975
So how is machineq helping the Enterprise adopt iot

204
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Applications fast

205
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:22,655
Enterprises are actively piloting many low-power iot devices today unfortunately

206
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,263
Many aren't stealing fast enough because they look the scale lacrosse

207
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,663
Particular vertical application

208
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,783
Infrastructure which becomes difficult to manage

209
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
Have devices

210
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Digital air

211
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,695
Gateway as well we offer a centralized

212
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
Best in Class

213
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
Lora Gateway

214
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:52,095
Couple of software to manage those gateways and software to manage

215
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
Multiple types of devices

216
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
Rather than taking multiple Court

217
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,287
On routers and switches in your factory or in your store

218
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
Machineq Gateway and Gateway management tools

219
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
Companies and partners issue lights

220
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,551
Where can I go to find out more about machines

221
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:18,719
Can you can go to machineq. Com to learn more about our products and services

222
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
Chewy.com

223
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,119
I like the CEO of resideo or P&G this wasn't

224
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,399
Colors first time

225
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,703
That was last year

226
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,007
However the maker of fixtures

227
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Toilets

228
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,847
Tubbs was the talk of this year show with its

229
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Madam a enabled

230
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Toilet

231
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
That's right

232
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,247
Part of some of the collections they put

233
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
The Amazon Echo

234
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
Into a toilet

235
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
So you can talk to it

236
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,927
I asked Jonathan Bradley a Kohler

237
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Why

238
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,767
Closer decided to make that decision

239
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
And how

240
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,703
Okay color was the star of CES

241
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,383
But there's actually real value

242
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:17,343
Spill my spaghetti

243
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,999
What's the weather like

244
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,583
Yasso Kohler 145 year old Ran

245
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,983
The meeting design innovation in the bathroom space

246
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
You already know that

247
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:40,127
80% of consumers bring a smart device into a tablet or phone into the bathroom

248
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,455
And we already know that 13% are using voice to do some

249
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,367
Where did China give him that experience more elegantly in more Integrated Health Providers use cases

250
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
Next products

251
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,719
Why do I

252
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,791
Especially because you got it embedded in the mirror

253
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
Which is also

254
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,983
Yasso the choice

255
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
Right so

256
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,663
Go ahead and better than Amazon Alexa we know that every morning you start in the bathroom

257
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
Information download weatherby's what's my schedule like for today what's the weather help me decide what to wear or fiction

258
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,599
Play music

259
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,999
And it also Alexis

260
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,607
Oh my gosh sitting on the toilet and telling madam

261
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
Weird

262
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,215
I'm sure there are people out there

263
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
Let's talk about

264
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:45,151
The overall it cuz you got a bathtub you have the sink mirror and you have the toilet

265
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
You have a shower

266
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,527
Yeah so what's great about car companies offer the full port

267
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
Polylok products

268
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,135
Bathroom for consumers weatherbeeta shower the tub the toilet

269
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Vanity mirror

270
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,815
Entire collection so we can help curate that portfolio products for you in build that smart

271
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,863
To walk me through my

272
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:09,215
Kohler smart. I have just woken up

273
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,615
Just woke up

274
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,175
Ray's lighting

275
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,759
You could have it energized the most bright setting in the morning to help you wake up

276
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
Get ready and start your day

277
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:29,695
Then once you're energized for the morning right now have Alexa start your morning routine so your shower can turn on your lights

278
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
Your lab write setting

279
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:36,863
After your shower your coffee pot start all that can be automated while you're still in the bathroom finishing up today

280
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:42,495
Okay and right now I have a Google home mini in my bathroom and I use it to listen to podcast while I shower

281
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
It's fine

282
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,335
Okay so these are products that I plan to buy

283
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,063
As you add technology to them does that shorten their lifespan

284
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:02,719
So we understand these are fixtures in your bathroom

285
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:09,119
Created over the updates for all these products between voices going to be around for some time once these products be updated

286
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:21,151
And how did you guys do this did you hire

287
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
What is the process because

288
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,783
Embedded boards in like software development that does not feel like

289
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,087
Maybe your class of expertise

290
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,743
Yeah so a couple ways talk about that so we've actually technology products for over a decade

291
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:41,375
Add intelligent toilet if you have Smart bathtub to ever hydrotherapy we've been doing this for some time

292
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,007
This is an axe progression in a mixed bag of how our products work

293
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,615
We've also got a partner with the right vendors to make this ecosystem to Microsoft azure

294
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,175
Is our our partners Rockside environment

295
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:59,039
Done that was right for making the products right and then the infrastructure right together so it's been a partnership

296
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,927
Another big Trend in both a bathroom and outside of it was aging-in-place

297
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,791
We're all very concerned about the demographic shift to more seniors and not enough

298
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
People to take care of them

299
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,887
Beer in the US or in Japan where this has been happen

300
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Sing for a while

301
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,239
So we saw a lot of robots who could help care for the elderly

302
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,079
A lot of fall detection sensors and tons of wearables

303
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
Even companies in the smart

304
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,919
Home we're trying to find ways to build

305
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,479
Non-intrusive sensor send to device

306
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
Help keep an eye on grandma or Grandpa

307
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
Neil Mitchell of

308
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
Leo

309
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,439
Explains why his company pivoted from a smart night light

310
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
2 a device that helps

311
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
Keep track of people inside there

312
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
Alright Sunil

313
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,887
I remember Leo launching a couple years back

314
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:52,287
Listen for

315
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
Seem to gain a lot of traction

316
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,431
We're here now at CVS and you pivoted can you tell me a little about what you're doing now

317
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,695
Incorporate a bunch of senses

318
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
Jamaican impression

319
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,983
I can find your cell phone real food making its activity away

320
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,519
Intelligent

321
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,847
Independent Living parents

322
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
So in addition to

323
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,135
Okay

324
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:45,535
Grandma grandma may want to know that

325
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,607
Form I can have these in different houses then we're all on the same

326
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:59,103
Personal best

327
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,687
Cell phone

328
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
What sensors are inside then

329
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:23,935
This is a Resurgence of radar you guys were seeing and everywhere which is kind of a neat thing to do and is typically More Fry

330
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
Privacy-focused

331
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:30,079
Service plan now at this night light used to be like $99

332
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
What are you charging for it now

333
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:51,071
Maybe one of the bedroom one of the living room on The Fosters

334
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:57,471
It's grandma gets up in middle of night

335
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,407
And once again it's time to hear from our sponsor machineq

336
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
Let's go to Alex

337
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,039
Alex Winter that we saw last year is that companies are looking for

338
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,599
Specific vertical Solutions

339
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,672
They need a lot of help and expertise

340
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
In building out there iot infrastructure

341
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
How can machineq helpthe

342
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:27,168
We can help you in two different ways we work of hundreds of Vertical Sleeve providers

343
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
Who has deep

344
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:34,848
Sector expertise by building their own devices navigation layers and if you happen to need a mouse

345
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,152
Water detection device

346
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Wedding

347
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
System

348
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:43,040
It happens to be more aware we have a whole slew of things

349
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:47,136
And we can help match those particular Solutions with your needs

350
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,440
We don't have an existing partner today

351
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,256
We can even build and help design

352
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
Particular device that you need

353
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
Internally

354
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
Eventioneers web designers

355
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,448
We can prototype and commercialize that

356
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
For your particular request

357
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
Alex

358
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:08,128
Where can I go to find out more about how machineq can help me with

359
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
Particle iot

360
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
Applications

361
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,272
The best place to find information of the machines.com

362
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,464
All of the sensors in Connected devices in the world matter very little if you can't send the data around the home or two

363
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
The cloud

364
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,328
So for the rest of the show we're going to focus on the network connectivity Trends we saw at sea

365
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,376
Faster WiFi

366
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
Lower-powered Wi-Fi

367
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,448
Bluetooth mesh and

368
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:36,288
The return of that. Which is a wireless interoperability standard

369
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
Rings

370
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
Thread and Wifi together

371
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
Are all in the same

372
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,152
So first up

373
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
Let's talk to Brian Bedrosian

374
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,504
VP of marketing at Cypress semiconductor

375
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
About Bluetooth mesh and wife

376
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,648
Okay so one of the big topics here is PS is as always

377
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,184
Smart Home

378
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:57,536
Wireless standards Etc so Bluetooth Alliance is

379
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,584
Really making a big deal about with mesh

380
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,400
And they're also adding profiles for various Smart Home

381
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Home devices

382
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,984
And I'd love to get your opinion on

383
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,288
How this is actually going to play out

384
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,336
Profiles on top of a radio

385
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
Feel like an effort

386
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,176
It might lead interoperability problem

387
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,272
I think you have the Bluetooth Sig has been great about

388
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,832
Creating interoperable profiles

389
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,624
For audio and

390
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,696
Mouse and keyboard for years

391
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,744
They've done it better than anybody else

392
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,048
If you look at the whole wearables

393
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
Market

394
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
Fitness Inc

395
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,752
Distinguish Bluetooth is

396
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,288
Technology

397
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
You know growing across new segments

398
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
Big Moose horn

399
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
Okay

400
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:51,296
And are you excited you see that people are getting really adopted for the smart home or is it going to be you know maybe the more

401
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
Traditional technology

402
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:57,440
Are we really believe that Bluetooth will begin to expand more on the Smart Home

403
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,512
Wi-Fi horses of the home internet

404
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,328
And this is the factor standard for home networking

405
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,144
Who is this is the most compatible technology

406
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,704
Stand Together there and every smartphone in

407
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,496
How was the consumers used

408
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
Control their home

409
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:16,384
So we really see the combination of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi evolving to really be

410
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
The center of the home network

411
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,504
You think we'll see Bluetooth power sensors

412
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
Baidu Bluetooth

413
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,856
Energy is really brought together a whole new

414
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,904
Realm of ultra-low-power products

415
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,696
Coupled with high-power Tran

416
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
And with mask

417
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,792
Completing the Bluetooth profile

418
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,864
We can connect every device together feeding back in

419
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
To the home control

420
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,472
Okay so Cypress is a chip vendor and you guys bought broadcom

421
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
Wi-Fi

422
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,824
Some Trends you're seeing in Wi-Fi I know here

423
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,128
So far I've seen a lot of

424
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,408
Wifi powered device

425
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,456
Superpower

426
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
Hungry

427
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,296
People just don't want to do a tub so I'm very curious what are you

428
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,624
We're seeing two different direction

429
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
Jensen WiFi right now

430
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,696
We'll announce our Wi-Fi 6

431
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,280
Technology the latest generation of

432
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
11 a.m.

433
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,096
Gigabit-speed Wireless

434
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,144
Tomorrow for automotive entertainment

435
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
Power wife

436
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
And there are a couple

437
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
Companies that are now

438
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Prodigy

439
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,824
With our new 2018

440
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Ammeter wire

441
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Best products

442
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
Better delivering power

443
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,456
Consumption profiles very close to what Bluetooth was

444
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
A couple years ago

445
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,784
So battery operated Wi-Fi is

446
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Is here

447
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
Wait a second

448
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
All right

449
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,488
Is this a new Wi-Fi standard like Halo or something weird like that or is this just low-power Wi-Fi 6

450
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,376
This is just low power Wi-Fi fantastic architectures 802 11ac friendly

451
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,424
And works in any home network

452
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:50,336
Talk about this in battery life on this kind of sensor like or is it for sensors or something like that or we flipped

453
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,128
More for like cameras or that kind of

454
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,736
Yeah right now the low-power Wi-Fi is really for things more like cameras

455
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,272
Portable music

456
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,552
Things like battery operated

457
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
Thermostat

458
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,136
But we'll see one more Evolution pasta

459
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,416
I'll take it into the sun

460
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
Hbase as well

461
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
That'll be what time frame

462
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,792
12 to 24 months

463
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
Going to hold you to that Brian

464
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,400
I will deliver

465
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:19,520
As you can probably tell I have my doubts about those Wi-Fi sensors happening anytime soon

466
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:24,128
But I did see some Bluetooth sensors when I visited with Kevin Tate of rigado

467
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
We talked about sensors sales and who's buying

468
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,624
We've been talking a lot about Bluetooth here at CVS and I finally found what I was looking for

469
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,464
And this is a big deal for me because

470
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,768
I love sometimes I think there's a lot of power in them

471
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,560
And I

472
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
It's more accessible technology

473
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,936
So let's talk about what

474
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
To get to this point

475
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,728
Where we have

476
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,592
Sure

477
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,640
A lot of commercial applications

478
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Required

479
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
Divisive

480
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,040
Where are you need a device that can do the sensing connect via Bluetooth and then get

481
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
2 something

482
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,088
I like it that way

483
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
I can translate

484
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,904
Bluetooth profile information

485
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
Into something like

486
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,208
Mqtt

487
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
What was required

488
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
Was

489
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
Getting that pipeline

490
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Standard

491
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,704
So that companies could not have to build every step

492
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,752
So a lot of what we've done in the

493
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,288
Gateway's make that

494
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
Ble

495
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,848
Bluetooth low energy

496
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,408
To mqtt translation

497
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,432
Very easy

498
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:34,016
So in particular

499
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
Wide variety

500
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
Anything that's

501
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,648
Bluetooth 4.2 or Bluetooth 5

502
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,440
Appliance can talk to her Gateway

503
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
You can talk to it

504
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
What is a beacon

505
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
Impaired mode

506
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,560
We can even control those devices

507
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,120
Are Gateway and all that can be pushed seamlessly

508
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:55,520
Go to the cloud it's a little wacky though because people

509
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
Hairball blockage

510
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:07,808
I am curious it does that change

511
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,880
Huge difference when you move into a commercial environment

512
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,160
Verses relying on

513
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
A personal foul

514
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,280
And extremely good

515
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,072
Connecting to wireless devices

516
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
Running secure applications

517
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,264
Connecting to the cloud so in a lot of ways the infrastructure required to collect sensor data

518
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,360
Restaurants or hospital or a smart office

519
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
Looks a lot like a phone

520
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,176
You doing the same thing

521
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,504
Connect devices running applications and pushing data to the cloud

522
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,648
Is short of a someone stapling their phone to to the ceiling of every room

523
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,464
You need an infrastructure that's a little bit different to do that

524
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
Still secure

525
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,632
Still scalable but one that can run multiple applications collect data from lots of different types of sensors

526
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,424
Get it where it needs to go

527
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,752
To your point I think the fact that Bluetooth especially

528
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,776
Started with the

529
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,872
Means that the landscape of the infrastructure that

530
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,920
Companies like Regatta recruiting now

531
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,480
Mirrors a lot of the way you used to do it

532
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,064
Okay and what are the big seems that

533
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,856
It's a nasty yes payments just a

534
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,928
We're all trying to. Biote and fighting it's really hard theme

535
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,024
Is this idea of I will package everything up to you

536
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,816
A bunch of whatever

537
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
And then give you the date

538
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,192
We seen this with companies like my devices machine

539
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,240
Damn it right now is a sponsor this pretty

540
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
Tequila episode

541
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,032
And

542
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,336
You guys are talking about this

543
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,640
Why is this happening and

544
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,664
What are the ramifications

545
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
Locations of that

546
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,832
Has a couple of interesting reasons that's happened in and then things that unlocks what is

547
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
A lot of iot

548
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,904
He is still in

549
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
Pilot prototype

550
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,232
And so companies

551
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,768
What's a company says

552
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,352
I'd love to have temperature and location data

553
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,912
About all these Assets in my warehouse

554
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,472
How to get that date up to the card and see what I can do with it

555
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,264
If it takes them

556
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,872
6 to 9 months to get to the part we actually have the data

557
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,920
Quote see what they can do with it

558
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,200
Then

559
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,736
Tremendously

560
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,320
Right and so being able to me like that

561
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,904
Here's a package that allows you to get the data you wanted

562
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
RN

563
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
Even and afternoon

564
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:28,608
Write to the part where you're assessing the business value your testing out the ROI

565
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
Figuring out

566
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:33,472
What it would mean to to invest in a large-scale solution I think that

567
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
That unlocks

568
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,800
A lot of power

569
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,616
Was frankly held up by iot industry from a pilot

570
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
And who is buying

571
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,480
These types of solutions is it

572
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:48,832
The guy who in the hospital is trying to keep the drugs what's happening

573
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,904
The answer can be all of the above

574
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,696
One of them

575
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,232
One of the

576
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
Areas of focus for us your rigato

577
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,352
Is we are trying to get that data

578
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,984
To a solution provider a systems integrator or an Inn customer

579
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,288
Ultimately needs to be able to

580
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:11,104
Aircloud

581
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:15,456
Are there a lot of solutions out there

582
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,040
I would seem more like a stovepipe solution

583
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,088
That you up if you use their sensors

584
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,392
Thundercloud

585
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
You can

586
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
Take that taser

587
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,536
The customers at work with Elgato

588
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,608
Get the data directly to their own

589
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
Cloud

590
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,424
Infrastructure that gives

591
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,776
Ultimately

592
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,080
Datastream

593
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,616
Becomes the point of intersection

594
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:50,528
Empire last interview I try to figure out what happened to thread and why this is the third year that we're hearing about

595
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,320
Gdb in thread coming together

596
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
Sadat.

597
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,720
I still haven't seen any products on the market touting thread or..

598
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
So Daniel mineta

599
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,096
Co-founder of mmb networks and a member of the zigbee board of directors

600
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Explains why

601
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
What are the new things happening

602
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,592
The idea is

603
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
Thread

604
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,408
Which is yet another wireless

605
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,688
Call over things like

606
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:22,016
Wi-Fi

607
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
And this is actually

608
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,856
The second-year we've heard about that. At CVS

609
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
So I'm curious

610
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,672
Why we're hearing the six

611
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
Been talking about..

612
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
ICS

613
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
And I think

614
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,912
Because we have to keep in mind while Beast

615
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:39,936
Bodies Leipzig

616
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
Years ago

617
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
What we announced

618
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
Distance

619
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
Interoperability

620
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
Reliably

621
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Mosto

622
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
The date

623
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,672
Animal that's running

624
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,208
Networks that aren't too sticky

625
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
Like bread and other

626
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
Fred was

627
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
The first one that

628
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Guichos

629
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
Last year we announced that

630
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Actually

631
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,936
He had me but I think had a name for it

632
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
2 years ago last year

633
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,496
Was..

634
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
That

635
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
What the Fred group

636
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,336
We had reached on

637
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
An early version of

638
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
Released

639
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
We invited people

640
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
Come and join

641
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,456
To look at the Spectre

642
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,248
Start working with it we had devices

643
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
Operable on this Earth

644
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,624
And now at CVS

645
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
2018

646
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Pronouncing

647
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
Despective

648
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
The 100 status

649
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,792
Completed spec

650
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
Developer

651
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,864
Start working on will that work

652
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
Going to change

653
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
Also important

654
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
Especially

655
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
4

656
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
Is that

657
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,872
And not only that but we work

658
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:52,896
The Fred group

659
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
Work that.

Available on

661
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
To ensure that there is

662
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,784
One is not

663
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
More assertive

664
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
Haitian houses

665
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,600

666
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392

667
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928

Ghost bread

670
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
Why is it

671
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,840
Consumers should I care about

672
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Because

673
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
City of Moore

674
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,216
So what does it mean for

675
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:22,336
Sweating over the past couple of years the smart home has kind of been a wild west

676
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
Home and

677
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,712
What do they know it or not the way they've been

678
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,736
Connecting them is by

679
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
Creating account for that device

680
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,552
Connecting it to that bend

681
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
Answers cloud service

682
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,600

The Google Cloud

686
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
What's that mean

687
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
Communicate from there

688
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,024
Administrative work

689
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
The first

690
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
One or two

691
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,864
Two or three devices or maybe the first

692
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,656
3 months out of the box

693
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,728
Fall apart a little bit

694

Scale

695
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,520
Can you have 30 devices

696
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
And they're all talk

697
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Controller weather

00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
Cloud what you're going to get is the

701
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
This thing where every so I

702
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Doesn't work

703
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
Frustrating

704
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,304
We kind of have a tolerance for that on our smartphones I'll find the app crash I'll restart it

705
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
We have no tolerance for that

706
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
When are lights

707
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
Turn off alerts

708
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
Bendaroos

709
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
Realizing that

710
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
The only way to

711
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
Especially to the large population

712
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
Arnot Tech

713
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
Tolerance for

714
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Is not working proper

715
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,736
You need to have sex

716
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136

717
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
Who's in my house

718
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
Why do I still

719
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
I care about this

720
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
Maybe a joke

721
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,792
It's almost similar to

722
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
Think about

723
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,352
This time in the iot

724
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
The internet is here

725
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
AOL

726
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Or MSN

727
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,264
And you kind of had to stick

728
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
Nose

729
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,360
You had friends on those networks great

730
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
If they weren't

731
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
Dairy success

732
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
Start the internet

733
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
Write that

734
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
Innovative

735
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
Figure out what people actually

736
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
Turbo

737
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
Emailing that works

738
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,696
But eventually

739
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,464
You did want to talk to

740
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,584
Internet not just what one of those ecosys

741
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,656
And that's kind of where we are in the smart

742
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Major company

743
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
Are probably still going to be

744
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
Mayberry in Port

745
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
