00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,264
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,288
This is your house

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,568
Stacey Higginbotham

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:18,944
This week

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,480
Actually was late last week

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,856
Shop to its very core by the departure of

8
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,136
Girlfriend

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,952
He didn't the part he was set to away mode

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,024
I screwed up Kevin

11
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,560
Bathtub

12
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:39,168
Yep Tony's gone stepping down

13
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,192
Stepping away

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,752
Apparently is invested in like a hundred small startups

15
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,032
The Pacifier 2

16
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,568
Including a go-kart company

17
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,848
Which

18
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,896
There's a lot to talk

19
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
There's a lot

20
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:53,248
First of all he's leaving after a bunch of

21
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,016
Bad press

22
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784
Next

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
But

24
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,880
The Verge actually did a story I'm going to say it was Tuesday

25
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,160
Tell you about how

26
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,952
Fidel head actually told

27
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,976
Google

28
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,256
Larry that

29
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,792
He was leaving in

30
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
December

31
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:11,424
And wanted to transition out so he was kind of unhappy because it sounds like

32
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,496
When Google became alphabet

33
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
He suddenly got

34
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,312
Different marching orders

35
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,664
A little more accountability from a financial standpoint

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
Getting things done

37
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,968
Kingston Market

38
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,992
Less vision

39
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,272
Model the product

40
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
Selling

41
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:32,928
Let me ask you if you have a problem with that I mean you're looking at a company paid over three billion dollars for nest

42
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,464
I don't have

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,536
Have a problem with it I can see why I would have a problem with you

44
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,840
I mean especially if he was promised

45
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,424
He wouldn't taking it was going to be a YouTube style investment for

46
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
Google where they give you to

47
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
Like a decade

48
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
To get profitable

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,664
So if you're thinking along those lines than yes it has always been

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,224
Super long term I mean the man pushed a new protocol

51
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,784
That's that's not a short-term that right there

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
Right right

53
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
But but

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,904
Me play devil's advocate here I'll save from

55
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,696
Alphabets perspective sentence

56
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,280
I'm just giving my perspective on what they would think they spend a lot of money

57
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
And

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,864
How many new products really came out in what

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,144
3 years

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Mastro's owned

61
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,240
There's nothing

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
I mean

63
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:25,664
Pipeline to The Nest Thermostat

64
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
Not really

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,552
I get it and also you know.

66
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,624
Google actually was in talks to purchase Dropcam

67
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
Like

68
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,952
They brought that deal in in May

69
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,768
A part of Nest Tony was not like searching around for the

70
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,096
Right that we know there was some some angst

71
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,424
There between the Dropcam folks and then ask folks based on reports of

72
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,896
Response to Tony fadell calling the

73
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
The real deal

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
So that being said there's a

75
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
Couple things to do

76
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
Think about here

77
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
1

78
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,464
Is the new CEO Marwan fawaz

79
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,816
Is a former CTO at several big cable companies

80
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
And

81
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
I believe it was Adelphia

82
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
And

83
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
Charter over there

84
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,056
This is a man who a has a lot of

85
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
Experience in the

86
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,176
Service provider industry which I think is actually a really interesting

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
Space for the smart home right now

88
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,344
And he also was a VP at Motorola Mobility

89
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,904
Managing their Motorola home business

90
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,744
The man knows how to hopefully build Hardware

91
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
Support it

92
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
And sell it

93
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
Which actually if your

94
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,936
Cheer consumer who wants to buy this product this may not be the worst thing for you

95
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Agreed

96
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,288
The great I mean he's got the right background

97
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,384
You know I can't say I know of his accomplishments at those companies and whatnot but

98
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
Kiss My Bass credential Sandpoint

99
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,528
You know that's exactly what you would want everything in a nest group

100
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,368
Yeah it was actually the technical Advisory Board of ATT

101
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,952
Around the time that ATT was getting super involved in the Smart Hub

102
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
Come to

103
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
So I feel like

104
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
Alphabet

105
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,887
Is telling us something very clear here which is Tony fanelle's vision for the Smart Home

106
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
May have been

107
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
Where's the 3.2 billion dollars

108
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
But it's not playing out fast enough

109
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
Screw division

110
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,383
Let's just go with making a quality product

111
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
And

112
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Get it out in the park

113
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Ripe

114
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
Tri-tip as a nest owner

115
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
I mean I'm not concerned by what's going on are you

116
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,855
No no I'm actually a little heart

117
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
Now I will say

118
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
As someone who loves the industry

119
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Fidel was

120
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,119
It's Magic here so we had a sense of how we

121
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Get there from

122
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Tactical perspective

123
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,007
I can't

124
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,383
You know it is kind of a loss to say

125
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,687
Dang it now we don't have this person I mean

126
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,759
Cuz it was an open but the worst with Nest program

127
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,295
Wasn't awesome

128
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Way

129
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,391
To get people to buy into the smart home without actually

130
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
Freaking programming stuff

131
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,487
But here's the other thing I want to talk about cuz

132
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,047
ARS Technica wrote a story speculating that

133
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Alphabet to put nest

134
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
I don't believe that Nest is up for sale

135
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
Was pure speculation on there

136
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Park

137
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
The story is a great overview.

138
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
Forecast

139
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,335
But I was thinking about what is the value

140
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
Apple connected home

141
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
Today

142
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,247
Because you've got a device and there's not a subscription Revenue

143
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
So what you would be buying is

144
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,855
The device the Goodwill that sort of thing

145
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,207
But you also are buying the promise that you're going to support that device forever

146
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Right

147
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,351
I just kind of started thinking about me and is that really a great model to

148
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,935
How should we start thinking about these companies that are actually successful

149
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,287
SmartThings for example sold to Samsung for 200 billion which is

150
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,847
A considerably smaller sum than 3.2

151
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,199
Yeah cuz you said there's no subscription model that could change that

152
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,015
Could Implement something but they have to provide more value than what

153
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
What's provided today

154
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,135
Obviously I think to a Google and alphabet or any other company in this with us

155
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,719
Getting the data is very important

156
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
Get that data

157
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,535
Nest keeps their data separate

158
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
From Google

159
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
And that's been

160
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
Promised forever

161
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
So maybe that'll change

162
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
Tony was really

163
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
Component of fat that would be

164
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,823
Keep an eye on rtos

165
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
Pandora.

166
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
Why shouldn't we all should

167
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
And you

168
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
Arbolino new home

169
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,831
So soon

170
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
Cool stuff that you're having to

171
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
Do deer like

172
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,927
Yeah that's

173
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,767
Will I be two or three weeks we can talk about that cuz that's what we make the move

174
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,631
But a none totally unrelated to the Tony fadell brouhaha

175
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
We're actually

176
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,215
Not buying a nest for the new home

177
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
I decided

178
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,823
Even before this news came out I decided in already ordered an ecobee

179
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,639
Because for the same price I seen a little less on Amazon

180
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,687
I'm getting a remote sensor and

181
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
We purchase a townhouse with

182
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:23,135
Multiple levels in my office will be on the second level thermostat up in the first level just like my current house and I'm tired

183
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
Being hot

184
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
In my office when nobody's home and

185
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
My thermostat doesn't realize nobody talk

186
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
So the remote sensor will go in my office and I can always add more sensors I think they're two packs are like 80 bucks

187
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,983
Does reasonable soft works with my wink Hub works with

188
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
The Amazon Echo

189
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
So

190
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
Apple unconcerned it

191
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,359
It's just a better product for my knees

192
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,943
Has been my favorite

193
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
Favorite thermostat for

194
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:54,879
A long time it's not the favorite thermistor of Wirecutter which surprised me cuz I was researching

195
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
The Weeknd

196
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
They actually still prefer the nest

197
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,511
But the ecobee what's the next best

198
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
Sorry I'm working

199
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,911
The people over at The Wirecutter and I actually had an argument with their smart home guy about that I thought your wife

200
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
No

201
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,079
Soccer. Stacy so this week

202
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,127
Because it's almost Father's Day

203
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
Which

204
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,295
1830 around there I don't know, Dad I should know but I don't

205
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,087
No no I think it's someone else's

206
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
The shop to remember

207
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
You don't have to do it

208
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,143
I thought we should actually run through some gift idea since we did it for the moms might as well offer some option

209
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
For the dads

210
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
So

211
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
Throughout the

212
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
Logitech

213
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
Home Harmony

214
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
Dad's like

215
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
That's my guy

216
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,479
It's actually the Logitech Harmony home hub

217
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,295
And this is 99 box on Amazon

218
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
I have actually

219
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,903
Massena personal I feel like I've seen it for sale for a little bit less so

220
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
Wait on that Chopper room

221
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Shop around

222
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
But

223
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,511
If you have a smartphone

224
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,071
This is just a little Hub in the thing

225
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,631
We reviewed this probably a year-and-a-half ago

226
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,935
The thing that was amazing about it is

227
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,239
Logitech is awesome at AV

228
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,799
So you can pull in all your AV stuff

229
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
Super fast

230
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
Adidas just like this

231
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
Oh you have this receiver

232
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
Oh I sent the Roku

233
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
So that was

234
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:30,367
Super seamless I did have a little trouble connecting a couple of my device not connecting them but just getting everything to work

235
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
But once I did that

236
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
It was awesome

237
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,743
The added bonus is

238
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,303
You can connect it to you if this then that

239
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,351
If you're so inclined and

240
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,679
If you download the yonomi software and we've actually talked about this

241
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Before

242
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
You can set up like

243
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
Amazon Echo commands

244
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
For like

245
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
Netflix and chill

246
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Which

247
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
Will like set everything up for you

248
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
And I think that's

249
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,503
$99 get you the home hub

250
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,367
They actually have introduced a zigbee and Z-Wave home automation extender for it which

251
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
I have not tried but

252
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
I don't know either

253
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
That's also

254
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
That's a hundred bucks

255
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,351
And let's see they have if you want the remote

256
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Troll

257
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,655
To go with this

258
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:20,799
There's $145 package that you like a standard remote control and then there's like a

259
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:25,407
$260 package to get you the Hub and the touchscreen pants

260
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
That's nice

261
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
That we know what Kevin Gates

262
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
Daddy bikes

263
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,343
I'm throwing that out there is good idea

264
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
Kind of pricey

265
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
Universal remote all that stuff

266
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
Why not give him more

267
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,983
Makes sense makes sense so as a dad I lose things all the time and I know that you just had the CEO of

268
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
Macaron the podcast last week

269
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,383
But actually saw a Tracker in the wild yesterday along with the tile

270
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,479
I talk with somebody on my team at Google as both of them he puts the Kyle

271
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
It is Google bad she never loses that

272
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:07,135
And his tracker is on his key chain and I

273
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,951
Would recommend this for any that I think and I actually did

274
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Purchase four of them

275
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:16,351
Once I saw his because it's like the size of a quarter I mean it's the trackers really small

276
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,959
And it also has a replaceable battery which I don't believe the tile does I'm not saying

277
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,055
You got to send it back yeah post tiles the tiles bigger so

278
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,455
I like that you can swap this out with a coin size battery you know once a year or however often you have to do it they actually do

279
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
Do you have a current sale

280
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,319
Protect your Father's Day buy 2 get 2 free for 60 bucks

281
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:41,951
Plus if you know somebody who bought trackers they have it may have a referral link to my get another one free so

282
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,791
Which I did I actually dying of getting 5 for the price of 2

283
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,911
They're not here yet but I'm going to I'm going to do what my buddy does but one of my

284
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
What pads are my keys

285
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,263
Probably give one each to the kids I mean

286
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,591
I think it's a handy little device and it's not that expensive

287
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
It is not how much

288
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:06,271
It's thirty bucks for one but again right now if you buy two get two free Super 60 bucks

289
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
You got four of them

290
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
And that's what 15 each

291
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
Seoul

292
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
That's half price

293
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Yeah those

294
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
Got Fitness One

295
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
Oh that's right I was like

296
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
There's something

297
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,143
There's something else yeah well you know he we dad's we like to stay in shape or at least pretend to be in shape

298
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
I tried this

299
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Products

300
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
Way back before even

301
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,543
Launch a month before launch

302
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,591
Starting December January timeframe

303
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
And I got to say the most complete

304
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:37,503
Fitness tracking solution I can find an actually still used to this day

305
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,343
Is the UA healthbox Under Armour of all places

306
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
Again not cheap but

307
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
$400

308
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
What you got is a

309
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,303
Smart wifi-connected scale that does your weight and your body fat

310
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Just nice

311
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,727
You get the UA band which is a little wearable device with a small display that track your steps

312
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,799
Accu sleep distance the whole genome

313
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,383
Pretty much everything you want you also get a heart rate monitor

314
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
For your chest

315
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,223
That you can strap on and go use when you're running

316
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
I think that is

317
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,623
It for the $400 the app is fantastic app works on IOS and Android

318
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:19,487
Very holistic view of your health you can track your nutrition because you a also owns the

319
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,023
MapMyFitness app

320
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
So you get everything all in one

321
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
I got $400

322
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
If you really want to go Hog Wild

323
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,239
And I do recommend these Under Armour does have a

324
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
Pair of running shoes that goes with this

325
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,359
Want to see the look a hundred 2000 $40

326
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,663
They have a built-in sensors

327
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
And Bluetooth

328
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
And you literally

329
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
You put these on

330
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
You don't

331
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
Turn them on writing you put them on

332
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,111
You go run and it automatically tracks

333
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Steps

334
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
Distance and so on

335
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
And Pedro back into the system

336
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,303
And it just automatically syncs when you get back from your run you don't even

337
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,607
Do anything is a beautiful thing so

338
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,959
Again a little pricey but the UA healthbox is top-notch

339
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
If it were Mother's Day I would

340
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:10,687
Heart rate monitor

341
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
Strapped to your chest right

342
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,527
The heart rate does do it in a chest

343
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
IHeartRadio

344
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,599
It's not that I don't think it

345
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,647
Does a heart rate on the wrist

346
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Yeah

347
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
But

348
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
Did you find it accurate

349
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
Because the rich ones are very

350
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
Free accurate if your

351
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,679
I tend to find the chest heart rate monitors to be more accurate than the

352
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:36,031
The LED sensor that were using on the wrist are few exceptions to that but in general

353
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,615
The heart rate monitors are pretty solid and yes I found it accurate

354
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Cuz that's

355
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,455
Otherwise spending $400 on it

356
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Not a cure

357
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Heart rate monitor

358
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,927
The scale by the way works for up to at least four people so it's not even just for that I'm sorry up to eight

359
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,023
So that's a lot of people can they all stand on it at one time

360
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:01,631
Probably could but they better have small feet and it will probably break

361
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
Awesome so those are

362
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,775
Happy to hear others

363
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Yes

364
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
But

365
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,895
I have a I have a husband that's going to buy for it

366
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
I don't think it's smart home Gadgets in the

367
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,527
And since he's a little skeptical of the whole Space

368
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
Yeah

369
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Another product

370
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
It doesn't quite

371
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
I found

372
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
From Dave's

373
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Super

374
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,167
Exciting I knew you would love this

375
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
So

376
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
4

377
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,287
Like almost a year-and-a-half maybe even two full years

378
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,335
I have been waiting for Hugh

379
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,175
To put out BR30 switch or the can the lights that

380
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967
He put in your cans if your ceiling

381
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
In white

382
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
I have wanted this forever

383
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,367
And lo and behold Dave's at 2

384
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
Write something lovely blog

385
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,975
Scarfing through the FCC

386
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
Applications and he found

387
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,863
Philips Hue was going to do some white BR30

388
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
Yep yep yep

389
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
There is no timing on these there is no price on it

390
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,263
Hopefully

391
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,663
I don't know if is the type of company like Amazon is a type of company they never filed their at stuff with the SEC unless they're about

392
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Out to lunch it

393
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
I think

394
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,527
Philips is probably similar in that respect

395
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,831
So hopefully we'll see this very soon

396
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,415
Like there will be a party in my house

397
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,487
It will not have colored lights they will be white and it will be awesome

398
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
And they will be tunable

399
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,815
They will be tunable and

400
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,399
I'm hoping that they go for about $30

401
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,495
Feels like they could go to $40

402
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,567
So I'm still probably going to buy them

403
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
Because ice

404
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,663
Believe it or not you guys I still have light bulbs that are not smart

405
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
Although I will say

406
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
So this happened to me

407
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,063
My Philips Hue's that I've had in my living room

408
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,111
For like 2 + years

409
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
Disconnected itself

410
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,463
One of them just randomly disconnected itself from

411
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
The network

412
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
I have no idea why

413
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:09,119
I'm worried after my experience with the cheaper GE lights that what about

414
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Video fail

415
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,471
Not experience

416
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,871
But when it disconnected itself I realize that a

417
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
Putting it back on

418
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,711
Philips app was actually not hard

419
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
But getting everything

420
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
Back in track

421
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
For the echo

422
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
Is that required

423
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:36,767
Real relearning which devices are internet where I can possibly regrouping or learning improves yeah

424
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
Yeah

425
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
I wish there was a better way

426
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
I wish we could just save those

427
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Remember that

428
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,775
Just be aware that you know it's possible that liked

429
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:51,359
Two years afterwards you get some wacky things. I don't know that was kind of glitchy

430
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,455
You know some people are like this is why I don't want smart light bulbs I don't know

431
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,479
Need extra glitches in my

432
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:03,135
12 it's and it's a big investment I'm in your you have a bulb or two that the radios are shot and whatever you paid for those bulbs

433
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,207
2030 bucks a pop it adds up

434
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
Yeah

435
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,887
The other thing we should know is the lumens on these BR thirties that Phillips

436
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
Korean is about 680

437
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
That is not allowed

438
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,055
Excuse towards the lower light output side

439
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,127
But I'm not too worried about it because

440
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:28,479
I have like in my kitchen I have six of these and my kitchen is like bright is freaking

441
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
Daylight all the time

442
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Yeah

443
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,831
So and with a tunable stuff you can always tune

444
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
Down I guess

445
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
Quartz countertop

446
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,743
Have a a19 has 800 lumens

447
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,535
Chicken testing in

448
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
I can tell you about later

449
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
Another show

450
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Super excited

451
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Quick stats

452
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
August

453
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,311
The connecting door lock is connected its door lock to if this then that

454
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,847
So if you want to start

455
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,663
Doing things like hey when I unlock my door turn on my lights

456
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
It's done

457
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,967
It's done baby

458
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,367
Arlo which is the Netgear kind of home automation devices company has connected their outdoor camera

459
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
Stiff this in the

460
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
Which

461
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,255
I love because I want to put the outdoor camera on my route

462
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
I need to test a

463
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:19,935
And that way if there's motion up there I could set up a notification

464
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
Except a little siren

465
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,519
Your neighbors would love that

466
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,103
And then which makes welcome camera

467
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,663
And a weather station that I cut it

468
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Also

469
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:34,271
An outdoor camera that I don't think is actually out yet to later this summer

470
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,831
So they opened up their death program

471
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623

Cloud Library privacy

475

00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,832
That's tianjin

555
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
Irrigation

556
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,416
The trash can

557
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:30,048
You know we we basically run the gamut across a number of different verticals

558
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
To make sure that we were able to really

559
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:36,448
Change the way businesses operating or change the consumer experience by connecting things I haven't been to

560
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Okay

561
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:42,080
Are you guys today are in Houston to open up a Foundry which is

562
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
AT&T

563
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
I think it was like

564
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,432
Startup slash

565
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,712
Lab.

566
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,736
Kind of think about technology

567
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
And this one's focused on medical

568
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:56,160
Is this a new space for you guys or is it something where you were like you know what we just need a place to

569
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
The dedicated

570
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:01,024
AT&T has been creating Innovation space

571
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,584
A while as well

572
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
Foundry Networks

573
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
What we're doing uniquely here

574
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Houston

575
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
Is opening up one

576
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,776
Pacifically around connected health

577
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,568
And we've been active in the space

578
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
Quite a while we actually is

579
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
Willowbrook

580
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
Companies in healthcare ecosystem

581
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,968
They were already doing

582
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
Text device

583
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
Your growth rate

584
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,648
What's with the companies were already working with

585
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
We think Daniel take

586
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,256
Facility in dedicated specifically to healthcare

587
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
Advice

588
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
Accelerate

589
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
Adoption of new technology

590
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,912
And really appreciate the way Healthcare is being delivered

591
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
Kiran Houston

592
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,800
The Texas Medical Center is largest Medical Center in the world they already had an Innovations

593
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:50,944
Any chance you're plugged ourselves right in the middle of that or we can deal with the startups

594
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,760
The companies that want to bring those new Solutions tomorrow

595
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,832
Okay it is just focused mostly on

596
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,624
The Professional

597
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,928
Health and wellness as opposed to like

598
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,744
Activity tracker

599
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
Absolutely

600
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
Not it actually is

601
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
We're taking

602
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,680
We're looking at really kind of four key areas

603
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,496
Some of that is actually in the home itself

604
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,312
How can we be able to connect

605
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,384
Patients and their information

606
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,176
With their Healthcare professionals

607
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
Dealer-to-dealer up

608
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Location

609
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
Monitoring remote visits

610
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,624
We're doing work in the clinical setting about how can we make

611
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Better experience

612
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:36,256
Ecosystem

613
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
Nowhere

614
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,072
Actually all the assets are the

615
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
You need to be

616
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,376
Patient

617
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,960
Working a lot around mobile caregiving as well as those

618
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,984
Yes we can take this

619
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,568
Not just her Urban but even then trolls marketplaces

620
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,384
And then there's another final Focus

621
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,456
It's really about what all kind of call the connected Hospital itself

622
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,248
About you're really looking at

623
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,528
What are the operations

624
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,064
Ava Hospital

625
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,112
And all the things that need to move

626
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,440
Coming into the hospital leaving hospital as well as

627
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
Fuel mixture

628
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
Running as efficiently in a text

629
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
And how does AT&T

630
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
Think about its role here

631
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
Because

632
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,984
SIM card in this

633
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:22,080
Let's go to hospital blood pressure monitor inside the hospital

634
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,872
And

635
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,736
How do you guys see your role because it feels like

636
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,040
With The Foundry efforts you must be

637
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,856
Taking on a much deeper role and I'm curious

638
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,184
What that role is and then what have you learned from

639
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,744
Like your previous foundries that you hope to apply here

640
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,400
Yeah really for AT&T perspective we want to enable

641
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,216
Activity into any solution

642
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Beginning

643
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
Start of it

644
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,336
We also take a multi Network approach so that

645
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
You might be able to use

646
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,200
Biotechnology to put that in but you might

647
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,224
2002 use

648
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
Some other types of Technology

649
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
Within

650
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,856
I was in the hospital

651
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Free Wi-Fi

652
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
So you can be wired to assets

653
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,232
An attacker just made an announcement

654
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
Hello Satellites

655
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,560
Danielle a while ago about doing it with kids

656
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,840
Yak activities places

657
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,376
Networks don't exist

658
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,960
But then once you're connecting it is what can you do

659
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,520
Yeah with the information from back

660
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
Several different platforms

661
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,128
Do we bring to bear

662
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
Where are we can

663
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,968
Begin to aggregate the data from these in devices

664
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,040
We can actually going to take action against the data

665
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
We called me

666
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,600
Flow designer

667
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
We also have the ability to

668
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
Really

669
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,512
Provisions these different services

670
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,584
Down to the individual advice level level

671
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,960
All this on a global scale

672
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,544
And let's talk about how that turns into

673
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
Are you guys because

674
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,408
Verizon

675
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:07,296
And kind of have a similar like

676
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
Supercloud

677
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,416
Activity portions

678
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
Seems like

679
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,280
They told me that

680
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:24,192
They come up with the idea that about 80% of the revenue with iot was going to come from applications 15% with come

681
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,264
Platform and only 5% would come from the connectivity

682
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,056
I'm curious

683
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,128
Is true for you guys or if that's something that you're like

684
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
Maybe that's there

685
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:40,576
SA

686
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,368
There are definitely different

687
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
Places where

688
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,672
You can generate

689
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
Valuing

690
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:50,048
Revenues are being created within the industry activity

691
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,376
Actually Foundation

692
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,680
I did it going to continue to

693
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,728
Your grow in

694
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,032
Anxiety can be created based upon

695
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,848
Services that are coming out

696
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,920
A lot of what we call these low-power wide area Networks

697
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,224
RR brand new that are launching

698
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,248
There anyone else

699
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,272
How to use r

700
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,576
Arctic macroalgae Networks

701
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:17,440
To be into many more devices because we can reach

702
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,720
Different buildings

703
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,048
Or we can reach further we have longer battery life

704
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
Well as well as we have lower-cost

705
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,400
What does Solutions and so I think that there is

706
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,960
There's a lot of opportunity in connectivity alone

707
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,752
And then I think it is about you

708
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,544
Wants to watch you have it connected

709
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
And what can you do with

710
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
Cheetah

711
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,128
From those connections

712
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
How can you either

713
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,200
Transformer business is operating

714
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:43,040
I will transform the consumer experience by connecting things that make snacks

715
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,696
He said that carriers

716
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,768
Would start to have to worry about the last meter

717
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,584
Where before you guys kind of stopped at the last

718
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,936
I thought it was actually really telling statement especially when you're talking about

719
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,984
Multimode on the networks

720
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,776
He was hopping across different Networks

721
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,312
Also thinking about

722
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
My provisioning each individual device

723
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:12,480
Is that kind of a ways to start thinking about 10 of the internet of things and you guys

724
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,832
Yeah it's I think you're going to see exactly what she do

725
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,368
Transpired

726
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,440
Example in that in that electric space is it

727
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,464
We have a lot of

728
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,328
Taylor connectivity to a hub and then I use a different type

729
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,120
Local area network

730
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,936
I am licensed a southern reach the individual meter

731
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,472
So you're going to have a beer and have some

732
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,848
Dedicated

733
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,664
Chevy straight into and twice as well

734
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,712
And at the end of the day it's a

735
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
It is going to be about how do we

736
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,784
Effectively secure

737
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
Solutions

738
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,648
Using that advice layer at the network layer

739
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:56,000
Application layer and using the visibility that AT&T has around all the

740
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,792
Traffic that goes across our Networks

741
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,120
To make sure that we can see real-time into the potential

742
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,984
Other things that you know as we as needed so I think

743
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,080
We are definitely reaching further and further into the various endpoints

744
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,128
Is there a Surface Technologies

745
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,664
And just

746
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,712
Last week actually Erickson

747
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,136
And I thought this was kind of interesting about 28 billion devices

748
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,672
This was down from 50 billion

749
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,952
What still alive

750
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:30,048
1.5 billion would be cellular

751
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
And the rest would run over

752
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,864
Other networks

753
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,168
Does that number feel right to you

754
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
But yeah I think that's Harrison

755
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:41,312
Report end and research

756
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
Beijing TV

757
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,152
Opportunity

758
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Yaya Toure

759
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,968
Put together a fabric Network

760
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
Well

761
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,528
So depending upon

762
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,064
Royal

763
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,904
Rig in their Motors doing something agriculture

764
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
Doing something

765
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,488
Driving

766
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,792
Yeah you're going to need to make sure that you're putting

767
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,840
The devices on the best network

768
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,888
For the exchange locations

769
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
Okay let's talk about

770
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,448
Consumers

771
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:14,080
I am actually an AT&T consumer because you guys provide connectivity in my car so thank you for that

772
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,640
Excited

773
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:21,504
My car is actually paid for by the manufacturer so the connectivity

774
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
I don't pay for it

775
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
But if I

776
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,624
At some point in time it's possible that I might pay for

777
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
And get a monthly subscription

778
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,440
Or have to get a monthly fee

779
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,768
Subscription in without it I think my car becomes a lot less used

780
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,400
What do you think the pricing starts to look like for things

781
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,448
Looks like that to Consumers

782
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Finally

783
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
Do they feel

784
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,104
Good about that today like okay I'm going to buy the car and I'm going to buy subscription plan

785
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,152
Or is it something that maybe

786
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
Follows the Amazon Kindle model because

787
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,552
Self-driving cars these things aren't even going to work without

788
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,856
Connectivity so that it feels like it might become

789
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:02,208
Yes I think this is a place where AT&T is really young

790
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,488
Pleasant pleasant world

791
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,304
Different billing capabilities test

792
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,352
Bringing to the automobile manufacturer

793
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,912
I am and all those models exist

794
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
Today

795
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
We all we got

796
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,776
And what we allow the automaker

797
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
What services

798
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,408
Do they want stay for and then which ones

799
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
What day does she like

800
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,016
And we have what we call a

801
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,064
Billing capabilities

802
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,856
So I'll give an example

803
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,136
You got a car

804
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,696
Where are the automobile manufacturer is wanting to

805
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,744
Pull update off of the vehicle

806
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,584
Two operating over the air updates

807
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
Make the vehicle work better

808
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,192
And that's going to be a wholesale relationship between us

809
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,008
About automobile manufacturer to be able to

810
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,848
Help AT&T records. Conductivity and typically not charged

811
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,504
Build a tan customer

812
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,784
Credit card

813
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,856
Or even adding on to your AT&T Mobile Share bill

814
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,928
Where you got a big bucket today to your article from AT&T

815
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,464
$10 a month

816
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
All right

817
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,864
Let's talk for a little bit about the Smart Home

818
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,424
Because it is a Hot Topic this week

819
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:21,312
I think what a lot of people are coming at their they're realizing right now that maybe the Smart Home

820
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,128
I'm seeing a lot of the smart home is stupid the smart home is dead

821
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
And you guys offer

822
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,968
AT&T Digital Life I've seen ads

823
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,064
What do you think about kind of the evolution of the smart

824
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,952
AT&T

825
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
That's a great opportunity not only

826
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,792
Security from a foundation

827
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
Perspective it then

828
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:47,424
Once you've got the kind of chilly for the home and how can you bring other services

829
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,448
Automation

830
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,728
Home automation Solutions

831
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
To bear

832
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
And so

833
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,592
More more traction

834
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,640
I am more accustomed to taking

835
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,200
Get well beyond the basics of conductivity

836
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
I'm getting into you a lot of these different services

837
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:06,112
But it is complex to manage and being able to manage all that through a single interface

838
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,416
Is really resonating with the end consumers

839
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,208
If you want that you go out to try to

840
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
6 difference

841
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,096
Solutions if you want to be able to stand up in your home and your six different applications

842
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
Do you need to manage in order to

843
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,216
Make it all work that becomes a very complex situation

844
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,520
AT&T will go out to your home

845
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,056
How do you install

846
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
Dissolutions get setup

847
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,896
Appropriate and give you a single interface

848
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,688
Solutions

849
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,760
That that is where we really have to differentiate our offer

850
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,112
And it raised our homes

851
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:38,880
Solutions

852
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,416
And with other things were doing such a

853
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
Connect a car

854
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:45,024
So you think about our AT&T Drive Studio we're actually demonstrating this

855
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,792
Today

856
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,072
Where are your car as is

857
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,352
The Neighbourhood

858
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
It automatically

859
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,472
It's over 8000 sensera and invisible

860
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
5 miles out

861
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,080
Automatically have your thermostat lowers

862
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,152
As you approach the driveway the lights come on out to go on

863
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
And in Sodus

864
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,968
Ability to seamlessly

865
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,504
Happy sings interface

866
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
Without you having to

867
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,600
Do anything other than drive to and from your home

868
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:16,000
Is another great value proposition that where we are beginning to pull together different parts of the ecosystem and make more coarse a muscle

869
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,072
In our consumers willing to pay for this

870
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:23,680
Absolutely I think consumers are always willing to pay for Value that they get

871
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,216
Okay final question

872
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,824
What are you most excited about when it comes to the internet of things and what

873
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
Turntable

874
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,920
I think what I'm most excited about is the fact that

875
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
We are beginning to see

876
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,224
How

877
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,248
These things

878
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,808
Darion networks are beginning to

879
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,624
Take care of ourselves versus Outsiders take care of her

880
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160
I think

881
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,976
When we start getting into a lot more

882
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
Predictive

883
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,304
Solutions NM

884
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,352
Things are really enabling my life to work

885
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,144
Easier making a lot of my business

886
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,192
Operate more efficiently

887
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
Because I'm not having to worry about

888
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,056
Manufacturing Florence

889
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
The park

890
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,896
Might be about to fail

891
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:09,504
Yeah it knows that it's going to fail and it automatically doors replacement parts so it's sitting

892
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,552
Machine

893
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,088
Before the machine goes off

894
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
Beaver place

895
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah my doctor's alerting me that it looks like I'm about to get sick

896
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,048
Because if they've got information

897
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,864
It looks like things are trending the wrong direction I think this

898
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,888
Data science

899
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,192
The interestings is where it really gets exciting for

900
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,984
I think from a malpractice

901
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
The standpoint

902
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,776
Really stressed out

903
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,384
So Chris thank you so much for coming on the show
