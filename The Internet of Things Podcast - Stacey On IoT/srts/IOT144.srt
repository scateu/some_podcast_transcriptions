Kevin tofel

00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:24,832
And today since we are pre recording this in the early early days of December we are not going to be discussing

7
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
This week's news

8
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,392
Presumably there's not a lot

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,184
If there is will cover it next week

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,952
Because

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
How we doing

12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,792
Instead we're going to tell you about crazy iot prediction

13
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,840
Our biggest

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,632
17

16
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,168
And our biggest

Our guests this week will be my family

20
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:51,200
Let's go to a quick word from our sponsor a place it's a Feeling

21
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
The feeling that you're safe to enjoy the things that matter most weather for your home or business ATT helps keep you safe

22
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
So you can feel protected wherever you are introducing the ADT Security starter kit everything you need to get started

00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
Slash podcast today to learn more requires 36 month monitoring contract installation and activation fees

25
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:23,200
Did Roman and qspec pay required certain markets are excluded licenses available at ATT

Dot-com Florida ID through f0001 121 Louisiana Ave

1:6

28
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,136
Okay

29
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,160
Now we are back

30
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208
And let's kick it off with our

31
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
You want to go crazy

32
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792
Predictions are biggest

33
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,656
Let's go with biggest disappointment that we have good stuff new Happy stuff to talk about a fan

34
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Already

35
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,472
Let's kick it off with

36
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
My biggest

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
Where

38
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
Oware

39
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,592
My presence today

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,896
We have been talking about this

41
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
You know like

42
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
Gosh for like 3 years now

43
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
It feels like a really long

44
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,576
I keep wanting to be able to go into a room

45
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
And have the room know that it's

46
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
Me

47
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
Not somebody else in my

48
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,976
But also that I've been there so when I say turn off the lights

49
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
It knows

50
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
We got

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,912
We got closer I mean we do have cameras with video recognition now but they're out there on the market but

52
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,728
Yeah I agree I mean I always thought it would be

53
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
Either a little tag

54
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,056
Maybe it's Bluetooth I don't know

55
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
Guitar phone

56
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,896
Whatever but it probably will be

57
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:30,016
Cameras and facial recognition and that's going to be interesting because a lot of people may not want that

58
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
See I want a Bluetooth Beacon

59
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,880
Things I thought that was the ideal way to do it so you

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
Phone

61
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
Also

62
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
We also

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,768
Kind of got there

64
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:45,376
In a sentence with like the Amazon Echo letting you group things in a room although that

65
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
Not exactly

66
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,240
Perfect it's not perfect and it's more

67
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,640
It's Annie's of use thing it's not really a presence thing I mean it's putting the presence of the objects together but I think we're

68
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Song about our presence

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,736
That's right for a 1R smarthomes to be smart enough to know where

70
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
Kevin is in this room and

71
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
Stacy isn't that room and someone

72
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
I really don't have the

73
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
This ties in with actually a corporate

74
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
Or Enterprise

75
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
Kind of effort which is

76
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
Beacons

77
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,304
I was disappointed this year because I feel like beacons have no

78
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,376
They're not all that people are not I don't encounter them

79
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
Very often

80
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Spaces

81
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,984
I have the physical web in Ableton

82
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
IPhone 4

83
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
Couple years that's

84
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
Google

85
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
Beacon

86
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
Project

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
Cash nothing ever pops up

88
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,480
The only time I saw things pop up

89
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,296
Was when I was working for Google in the Google New York City office

90
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,368
I never had anything pop up in a store or anything

91
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,768
And I'm actually okay with that cuz I really don't know that I want the store hanging meat but it would have at least told me

92
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
I've only seen

93
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:52,192
A few or news of a few implementations and a lot of planned Abominations but

94
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,544
A could be the people ruin them out and we're just not aware yet but I tend to

95
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
Beauty the beacons are not yet all that

96
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,640
Yeah and I really thought there was

97
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
Interest Airbus on

98
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,736
I'm working but things like wayfinding I thought would be

99
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
Be really helpful in building

100
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,856
A lot of cool talk and there have been so pilots in like Stadium

101
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
Sports Stadium

102
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
To help people

103
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
Get to the shortest line the fastest

104
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Indicate which

105
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
Bathroom decor

106
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
But overall

107
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,559
Would be farther

108
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
So

109
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
Maybe that'll happen

110
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,703
Let's see what else is disappointing this year

111
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,519
Consumer protections and data

112
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:33,919
Retention and Salon that's been a continuing problem and no longer has a problem the worse it is for this Market at the whole I think

113
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,503
A couple shows back we talked about some legislation

114
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,111
Here in the US that might add some consumer protections to iot devices but

115
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,207
As we sit back on that show it was like a six-year time frame at best

116
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
Apple keynote basic legislation

117
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Willets Point

118
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,399
Committee and then we'll do the next step and I will do the next step

119
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,703
Task force of a committee to create benchmark

120
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
Protection right right right

121
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
I didn't even

122
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
Take up space in my brain

123
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:08,479
Guess so consumer protections I'm actually disappointed that we haven't seen somebody lost

124
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
And I'm betting it's because a lot of this

125
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
Well could be that it could also be the

126
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,999
People when you say. Attrition meaning in the terms of service that people agree to or

127
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,119
Yeah okay I was going to say that's probably why there's no lawsuits cuz people are agreeing to the terms of service but you're right

128
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:31,519
Buried in there probably have arbitration Etc Elsa and I'll be the first one to say I don't read

129
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
Read the terms of service

130
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,895
I'm almost at in your eye. And I should I'm setting a bad example so

131
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
Don't do what I do

132
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:43,551
People read your terms of service and decide you often don't see the terms of service to you bought

133
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
A product and that's an issue

134
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,879
Yes I would like that song

135
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:52,255
Also in consumer protections I would say we also have not achieved any sort of forward momentum

136
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
Round things like

137
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,839
Setting a product life cycle settings

138
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,887
Security parameters we did see

139
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
This last year the f

140
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
PC

141
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Sue

142
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:07,359
Couple router makers for having hard-coded passwords and still trying to advertise as being safe however

143
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,895
TC decisions were actually

144
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,295
Appealed so were and I don't feel that our current FTC is probably going to be as active under the

145
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
Ministration

146
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
So yeah

147
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
I would say things are not great

148
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
I would agree

149
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,231
They can only get better let's hope they do

150
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,047
And speaking of getting better or rather

151
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,351
It's opposite since this is the biggest

152
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
Section

153
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
Cash Baker I think

154
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
I feel like things are getting worse

155
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
Army integration

156
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,799
I need not into separate

157
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
1

158
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,871
We have not seen a coalescing

159
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,431
Billy around standards except for madame

160
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
Possibly Google home

161
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
So they're still too many hugs out there

162
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,063
There's still a lot of options

163
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
And getting things

164
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
To work together

165
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:54,719
Is not seamless you're like enabling skills and logging into like 16 different accounts

166
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,535
Get stuffed working and then even then it doesn't always work

167
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
It seems like we've got

168
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:05,727
Solution it's a bolt-on solution we just keep adding adding adding little bits not cohesive

169
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Solution

170
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
James Wright & Filippis

171
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
Amazon text alerts

172
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:14,943
Get the skills and I forget what Google calls them but they have something similar and then we also have

173
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
Yeah but their party Services I can

174
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
Rap all these things together with apis

175
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
It's just everybody's trying to put

176
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,671
Stuff together and why do they do that because it's not together by Nature

177
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
By default

178
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
And that's

179
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,327
Yeah you're right it's kind of getting worse in that sense

180
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631
And what's making it even worse and

181
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,679
My best example of this would be

182
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
Amazon Echo Show

183
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,543
And Google's YouTube video

184
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,383
Now the people are actually like the big manufacturers are actively try

185
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
Tear things apart

186
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,991
So one it's all I need to begin with but in some cases

187
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
Since I'm just never going to be

188
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,135
Write and in that particular case you bought something with the

189
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
Unexpected feature

190
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
That you no longer have

191
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,255
Which brings us back to consumer-protection

192
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
Badda bing badda bing badda boom

193
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
All right

194
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:06,143
So I really like honestly biggest disappointment

195
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,703
This year might be so far in the Smart Home

196
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
Still freaking

197
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,055
It sucks even though we said it's not for the last

198
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
3 years

199
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,383
I'm very disappointed with the end of

200
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Asheville

201
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
Angry about it okay

202
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
Emotional

203
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:26,623
That's okay no you're entitled to admit it's been a challenge has been issue I don't disagree but I do think

204
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
It's gotten

205
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
Better it sucks less

206
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,071
Depending on what it is what product or what service or whatever it is you're trying to do I think it does suck less we have more options

207
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Which has its pros and cons

208
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,703
I think it's getting easier to set certain things up just a mesh Network

209
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,055
For example can be very easy to set up and do a world of Wonders for devices in your house

210
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615
But you're right it still kind of sucks

211
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
No no

212
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
All right

213
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
Finally on my biggest disappointments are

214
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
My gosh

215
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,647
Cellular providers where are my flexible cellular

216
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
Transfer business

217
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
And startup iot f

218
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
I still feel like

219
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
We're not seeing a lot of it

220
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Innovation therein

221
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,863
And it's still hard for a smaller company

222
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
2

223
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
Kapil products with

224
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
Cellular-based

225
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
Wireless Solutions in them

226
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,103
Yeah I don't disagree with that I think this is still pretty nascent Market

227
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,943
In terms of using alternative networks for iot devices

228
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:29,599
Luckily one would hope that the carriers and operators have learned a lot from the mobile broadband Revel

229
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:34,719
Lucien you know starting tennis years ago in terms of what they need to provide on the network

230
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,535
Kind of demanding to have from devices and so on

231
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,839
We seen figures and other.

232
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
20 billion device

233
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,703
So I'll cut them a little Slack

234
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
But by this time next year

235
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,543
If this is still on your disappointments list

236
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
That's a major fail in my pee

237
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,151
Another disappointment

238
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Is

239
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
The Trump administration's decision not

240
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
To continue with the vehicle to vehicle

241
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,599
Communication standards 7th grade to like 5 years ago

242
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
And not to implement that

243
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Which

244
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,231
There's concern over the cellular in Hawaii

245
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
HiFi guys

246
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
But I really thought

247
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,071
We have this solved

248
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Yeah

249
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:16,191
I got a lot of people

250
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
Possibilities

251
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Screeching halt

252
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:24,895
I can't argue with you on this one I'm disappointed as well it's just it's something that took so long and get going

253
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
And

254
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,247
We even had you know an official protocol standard for it

255
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
And we were just about to get

256
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,367
Rolling out here and now it's like nope not doing it

257
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,695
So that kind of sums up my biggest

258
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,279
As always I'm disappointed that I don't hear more from

259
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
Companies that are actually implemented

260
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
Cool iot stuff

261
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
I know that you're out there I know there are pilots and

262
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
Sensitive

263
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
I'm a little disappointed that I have

264
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
Heard more

265
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Successful

266
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Scale

267
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,479
And that could be partially because companies may think we just implemented is one thing that was a mess of undertaking and it gives

268
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,271
This Thursday that we didn't have before

269
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
We can make more sense of it

270
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
But part of me says

271
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
Are they thinking that's not

272
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,975
Big enough in there for not reaching out or shouting from the rooftops look what we did

273
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
I don't know

274
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
Either

275
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
So that's our

276
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,351
So now we'll move into

277
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,679
Are crazy iot prediction

278
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Let's talk about

279
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,359
What we think is going to happen

280
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
2018

281
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
So

282
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,479
Let's kick it off with me on the smart home side

283
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
I think price is going to become a

284
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
Huge honkin deal to cancer

285
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,647
We're seeing so much interested really cheap

286
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,487
Iot home devices I think that's because people have realized that

287
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,047
Like we said earlier it's still kind of sucky

288
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,887
And I'm not going to spend a lot of money it's a lot to ask someone to spend you know

289
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,191
250 bucks on a camera

290
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,007
If they're not sure how it's all going to work together

291
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
What other products

292
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
So I think

293
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
Cheaper devices are going to come

294
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
If that's actually tied to another prediction

295
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
Air quality in China

296
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
Some Chinese manufacturer

297
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
It's actually getting really good

298
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
There's a lot more emphasis when I talk to you

299
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
Suppliers and

300
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
When I talk to me

301
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Facturar

302
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
They're telling me that in China

303
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
Quality is becoming a big

304
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Issue

305
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,911
And tell if you tie those two things together we're going to see some cheap devices but

306
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,727
Basement of quality and I think that's going to be

307
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
A lot of pressure on other

308
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
Providers in this area

309
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
I hope so because I just

310
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
Started pricing out motorized blinds

311
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,735
For my house and oh my goodness it's ridiculously expensive

312
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Oh yeah

313
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
So if you do motorized

314
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
I will tell you that

315
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,903
Part of the challenge is he want quiet blind

316
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
Mostly

317
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,463
Those quiet Motors

318
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
They cost a lot

319
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Yes they do

320
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,119
Yes I do so little me at a prediction in here I think after

321
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
When it's been

322
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,983
Since 2014 I think it was 2014 that Apple announced homekit

323
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,383
So was 2015 going to be the year of homekit while it wasn't 2016 no 2017

324
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,527
I think 2018 will be able to say yeah homekit has finally

325
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
Cortical arrive

326
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
Siri

327
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,623
Will probably just be good enough

328
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
I don't think

329
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,719
I made this prediction back when they announce the homepod in fact

330
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,791
Saying I then feel haven't proved serious that it will

331
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Compete better with

332
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:27,679
Amazon and Google's offerings but now I'm I'm rethinking that I do not expect that to happen

333
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
Still be good enough

334
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Yeah I think

335
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
The big change here

336
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,823
Was Apple's decision to go with hardware-based

337
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
Security Authentication

338
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,663
And they have really thought that

339
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,063
Through now we can be software-based where we staying out said it could be so I think that will ease the burden on a lot of these

340
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Device makers

341
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
Which they were kind of going in circles for the

342
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,231
The passenger year-and-a-half in my opinion so 2018 I'm going to call it home kit

343
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
Is it's a deer

344
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
I agree with that

345
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
But it's probably because I've been burned by

346
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,215
And the people I talked to have also been burned by him

347
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
The vendors

348
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
And manufacturers are certainly

349
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
Losing faith

350
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
Or have lost faith

351
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
The consumers

352
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,711
It's still a very popular request

353
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
People email is questions

354
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,415
Fewer things do work

355
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Don't get that is true

356
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
Let's see what happens this year

357
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
So yes

358
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
I do see some

359
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
All right

360
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,655
I also think in this is kind of a fun way

361
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,727
Actually going to see some Smart Homes getting built

362
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
Sonu belt

363
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
And

364
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
New apartments

365
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Smart features

366
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
Added to them or going on them

367
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
The new-build market

368
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
I think

369
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
Connected elements are going

370
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Package

371
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
So what kind of like granite

372
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
I do think that's happening

373
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Lennar

374
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Katie Holmes

375
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
All those companies

376
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,863
Investing in it I think we should keep our eyes open

377
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
It's a lot of these are investing around

378
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Particular

379
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Product

380
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
Like home kit

381
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
Where

382
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
Why is a non homekit

383
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,359
Are non Apple phone user I look at that unlike

384
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
That is useless

385
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
So that'll be really interesting

386
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,807
Developed that because the two ways of

387
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,367
I seen so far is homekit or they go with Ken

388
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
Proprietary app

389
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:29,535
That uses like a Z-Wave or zigbee and then a hug that the apartment community

390
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Provides

391
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,375
And then you just have a nap and that's usually in the apartment

392
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
Stormcutter

393
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,215
I tend to agree with you I think you'll see more of this

394
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,263
I think homekit will be the

395
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,847
Not that the factor standard for this kind of option but I think it'll be the one that's

396
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Offer the most

397
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,527
And probably chosen the most then I say that because the people who are buying homes in the future are the younger generation

398
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,343
Right man I'm a downsize yet

399
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,415
You can live there for a couple years maybe and stay there but whatever

400
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,975
You're not going to buy new construction again is

401
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255
My guess neither am I

402
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
If I buy it

403
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:08,447
I can't get any neutral wires every true I can sympathize with that personally but

404
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Again.

405
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
Generation X

406
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Up-and-coming

407
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
Spell remind vinegar properties

408
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,103
One thing I think they're

409
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
Probably more iOS than Android

410
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
And

411
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
They're going to want this

412
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
And I can't believe you just called me

413
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,855
I didn't say all that young girl

414
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
We're no longer

415
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Up-and-coming

416
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,231
AARP card online

417
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
All right

418
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,327
After Kevin's called me old let's move it move ahead to new prediction

419
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
Oh I like this one this is a good one

420
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,703
Always something I alluded to in a post

421
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
A couple weeks back

422
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,591
I think we will start to see in 2018 very slowly but we will see it

423
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,919
More offline or contextual Smart's in the home

424
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,783
Thanks to more localized machine learning and AI this goes back to some of the

425
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
Products that

426
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,879
Amazon announced this year back in November

427
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,951
I'll soon Google has some products around this time talking

428
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,511
Specific about green grass for Amazon and

429
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
Tensorflow Lite

430
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
For Google

431
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,631
I think it was a beer to bigger players in this space

432
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
And

433
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,751
We'll see if it's going to require new hardware or not I'm hoping not

434
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:21,407
It just amazes me for example that Google's pixel phones can be offline but still tell you what song is playing in the area

435
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
So there's some

436
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,991
What used to be in the cloud is now on the phone

437
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:30,367
Right way to see that everything going now to the home this last in 2017

438
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Intel

439
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
They launch date

440
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Device called the

441
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
Movie Diaz

442
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
I think was the neural network dongle

443
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
Had again

444
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
Capable of machine learning capabilities on this

445
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Portable little

446
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,471
Stick USB stick it was

447
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Crazy

448
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,055
So this is definitely a trend and I think what we're going to

449
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,103
I see is now that all this is out there

450
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
And people have started using it or going to CC

451
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
Some really cool stuff

452
00:17:55,199 --> 00:18:01,087
And the added benefit is when the robot overlords rise up again just pull out their AI dongle

453
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
Hi

454
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Also

455
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,791
This is more on the Enterprise front butt

456
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:14,399
Pink tour 2018 we can safely say that the race to the clouds

457
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Everybody in there

458
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Dog

459
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,495
Everybody in their dongle

460
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
Industrial space

461
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,383
Pretty much over there giving up that

462
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
We're now the cloud is over

463
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
The it guys

464
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:33,087
So we got a sure we've got Google we've got Amazon all offering really competitive and compelling

465
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
Iot services

466
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
For Enterprises

467
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Industrial class

468
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
And related to that

469
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,767
Next year we're going to see

470
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,303
Edge has already been a big

471
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
This year

472
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,679
But it's going to be more so next year we're actually going to see how companies

473
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Are implementing it

474
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,751
Where to see a lot of startups

475
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
Come in and solve for some of the

476
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
The problems of

477
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,359
Computing at the edge such as latency

478
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,639
Security issues

479
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Ambient

480
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,223
So I'm going to look forward to that

481
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Pill finder

482
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Call me if you're

483
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Cool startups in

484
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
We'll talk

485
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
And

486
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Hussy

487
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,903
Oh last week

488
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
But Kevin brought up a very good

489
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
How much is business

490
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Voice

491
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,279
I think that's going to be big next year

492
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
But it is also

493
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:21,727
I think I T has a lot of nightmares right now and I forget what survey it was with something like 62% of ITP

494
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,519
People surveyed back in

495
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
October November

496
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:29,407
Didn't even feel confident they knew about all the devices on their Network in their

497
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
And that's a

498
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,759
Huge issue a huge issue it folks want to know

499
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
Everything

500
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:40,927
Because they'll be held accountable if there's an issue and they certainly want to keep control of all that and the whole BYOD movement kind of

501
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,207
I took some of that away

502
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,023
I think the only reason they just got their hands on that

503
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,815
And wrangled those cats

504
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,631
But this is going to be a mess for them

505
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,679
Now here's where I'm going to go

506
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,567
I think next year it shops are going to reassess

507
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,591
How they're implementing

508
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
I think very much like a guest

509
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,991
We had earlier this year they're going to be looking for longer are Eliza's

510
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
The short-term

511
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,343
Because they realize that you truly do a business transfer

512
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
Information you actually need to think

513
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
Longer-term

514
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
Bigger

515
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
And just you know

516
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,279
These very easy automation projects at

517
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,631
So I think they're going to reassess their role in

518
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
An iot developer

519
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,215
Think we're going to see some local can

520
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,775
Control start to develop because a lot of

521
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,847
Value in iot a cruise where the sensors are

522
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,639
And often times that's going to be at

523
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Your branch office

524
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
Start a retail shop

525
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
I sent that is not where I T is today

526
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
So I think

527
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,319
Go Kevin

528
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
I was

529
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,951
Right there with you I'm like yep I agree I agree I agree and then when you said local control

530
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:52,863
I just don't see it does not want to give up control anytime it gives up control

531
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,655
It feels it's opening itself up

532
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:59,007
For accountability when it has no way to be responsible number one

533
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
Into

534
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,823
It people and I was 1/4

535
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,847
For 15 years and

536
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,175
Maybe it's changed since I was last in the night eShop

537
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,759
They don't want to offload things be

538
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
Because they feel it

539
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
Many of them feel it

540
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,623
Reduces their value to the organization

541
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,672
And sadly while I understand that

542
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:23,072
You know it isn't just a very specialized you need roll anymore it permeates everything in today's modern

543
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,096
Businesses so

544
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
It's a balancing act

545
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,192
For these folks and I sympathize with them.

546
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
They're going to fight

547
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
Tooth and nail to not give up

548
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,056
Control okay so maybe our fight is

549
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,336
It fights

550
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
Business

551
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
Over

552
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,968
Chi-Chi has always fought with business and it always will

553
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
All right

554
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,552
Well those are big

555
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
Predictions

556
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,368
For next year feel free to share your own

557
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,392
Predictions with us

558
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,184
I'm sure we'll get lots of cool ones

559
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,512
And then we decided to end it on biggest questions

560
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
Because

561
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,328
I don't know about you Kevin but

562
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
There's a lot of things happening that

563
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,472
Malik next year because I'm not sure how that's going to play out

564
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
But I feel like it's going to happen

565
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,568
So my first in this category is

566
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,360
What is going to happen

567
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
With GDP

568
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
PR and that is the

569
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,480
General data protection regulation

570
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,528
Yes that is the eu's act

571
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,320
It goes into effect May 25th

572
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,136
2018 it's basically instilling some

573
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Privacy and data

574
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,440
Protection charges

575
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,000
Across the European Union but also

576
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,280
For EU citizens

577
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,608
So that means if an EU citizen is renting a

578
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,888
Here in the US

579
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,704
They actually are protected by this which means

580
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
Companies in the US will

581
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,800
Undoubtedly and other parts of the world

582
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
Have to deal with

583
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
Many companies already put

584
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,688
Yeah I have a feeling they're going to

585
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,016
They're not going to be prepared for those kind of situations and

586
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
The other aspect to this is

587
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,600
We got the whole brexit vote

588
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
So

589
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:54,720
UK folks you're not covered under gdpr anymore unless

590
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,024
UK passes something similar on its own

591
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Yeah you guys are like

592
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,632
Dip with no privacy

593
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
SC Productions

594
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,496
Now I will say looking ahead at this

595
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,288
We'll probably see a Spate of lawsuits

596
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,080
Very soon after its path

597
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,616
Most of the big tech companies

598
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,664
Totally on board and have been

599
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,944
Forever In terms

600
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
Getting their house at 4

601
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,320
So we're going to see some really interested I think the lawsuits

602
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
Will see you're probably going to be

603
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,184
Smaller companies and maybe some of the sketchy data Brokers that have

604
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
Historically been in the shadows

605
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Is there going to start

606
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,304
We're also probably going to see some newspaper articles

607
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
Who are like

608
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
Reporter saying

609
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,192
I just ask Tinder for all the day that they have on me and holy cow

610
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
What they have

611
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,496
So I think there's going to be a real public

612
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
Accountability

613
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Challenge

614
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,312
That's going to come out

615
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,664
And actually I'm glad you mentioned that this is probably something that

616
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,688
You and I should

617
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,784
Consider doing as well as to the listeners every once in awhile go and download

618
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
All of your

619
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,368
Data that's available safe from your Google account

620
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,160
From Facebook or whatever

621
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,952
It is and go see what they really have

622
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,512
Because there's been a lot of interesting stories in the past year

623
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
About

624
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,840
You know Shadow accounts and so on so forth and let's

625
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
Probably

626
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
On us-22

627
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
Really dig into that

628
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
All right

629
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Just giving ourselves

630
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
More work

631
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
Next big Quest

632
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,152
What will the end of net neutrality mean

633
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,968
For iot assuming

634
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
That net

635
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
Neutrality

636
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:26,112
Does go by the wayside from the protections that were put in place two years ago

637
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,440
I don't know I can only because I don't

638
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
Know that we have all the details yet

639
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Split

640
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,048
I don't know what I'm sure you have thoughts on this

641
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,608
We don't have to that's why it's one of our biggest question

642
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
We don't have to know

643
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
We just have to

644
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,192
Bring it up as like

645
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Hey

646
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
It's possible now we're recording this

647
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,544
Before the December 14th vote

648
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
So we don't know how

649
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
Tamarindo or if it's going to happen

650
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,176
There's also will that boat stand after

651
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
Comet Pride

652
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,736
What kind of a judge don't know

653
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,016
That's going to be stuffed

654
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
To be decided and then

655
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,112
Also just how are

656
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,160
Isps going to

657
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Treat things

658
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,720
My Comcast has a very big

659
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,280
Smart Health effort and they also

660
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,840
Have been historically pretty aggressive

661
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
About

662
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,144
Walking things on their Network

663
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,728
It will be interesting

664
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
To say the least

665
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,056
Another big question we have is

666
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Security

667
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,640
I don't think security is an issue is going to go away

668
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,968
I am not really helpful and I would love to see a new security

669
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,272
Model developed for connected devices

670
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,040
In the home

671
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,064
And Enterprise

672
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
So

673
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
My big question then for next year is what

674
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:37,792
And also just because we're talking about legislation I wonder if we will actually have some real legislation

675
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,608
From a security standpoint that's passed here in the US

676
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,912
Because every said earlier it's just been

677
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,984
Nonexistent or on the very very slow Rhode

678
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,592
And my final big question has to do with cellular network

679
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,640
Lyrics I'm curious of NBA

680
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,408
Katem

681
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
Will win

682
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
Actually

683
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,504
Probably should brag mat for low-power wide-area

684
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
What will win

685
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,856
Probably

686
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:07,744
Is there still Laura there sigfox all those are being deployed and I'm curious if we're going to see

687
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
What networks

688
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,376
Become popular and what locations and for what types

689
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Business situations

690
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
Yeah I was going to say

691
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
What I think

692
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496
We'll see is different

693
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,544
44 winners in different Geographic

694
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,640
Regions based on operators and what they've already started it deployed

695
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
Bro they've already started down

696
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
Well and I have lots of

697
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,808
Peter probably a good place to stop

698
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,368
And give you guys some food cuz I feel free to

699
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Seriously

700
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Episode

701
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Scary difference

702
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
And stay tuned

703
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
Because

704
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,096
Is my family

705
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,376
Talking about

706
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,680
What has changed in our house what they like what they

707
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
Normal person

708
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
Perspective

709
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
I don't know

710
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
Hey everyone welcome back

711
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Back to the internet

712
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
Things podcast

713
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,624
This is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

714
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
AR

715
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
My family

716
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
So I got my lovely husband

717
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
Andrew

718
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,792
And my daughter Anna

719
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,560
Hi

720
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
And

721
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
As usual

722
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,656
Around this time of year they are here to join us

723
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,960
Did give you a mainstream perspective

724
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
On what it's like

725
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
2

726
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
Live in

727
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,336
So let's kick it off with this year

728
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,872
I feel like I personally have

729
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,712
I've tried out fewer devices and spent less time changing

730
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
Do you guys think that's true

731
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,320
I would say lately that's the

732
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:42,720
Case you know there's still some things that I wish would be tinkered with so they would work a little bit better but I think that's

733
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,512
It's probably true because you've got

734
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,328
Kind of a baseline together with all of our light temperature

735
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
So this year

736
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
I brought it in

737
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
A couple

738
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,960
New devices

739
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
I know everyone who listens to the show

740
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
Understands my husband

741
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,568
Affection for the June

742
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
Yes

743
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,640
In addition to that

744
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
What else

745
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
That you guys are like

746
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
It's not so bad

747
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,760
That's not so bad that's

748
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
What hasn't been so bad

749
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,856
All the Alexa's in the house

750
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,416
You do have quite a few more now don't we

751
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:17,280
They seem to increase over time

752
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
NAU

753
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,144
Previously told me that you did not want any smart devices

754
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,448
And now you have an Amazon Echo

755
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
Why was that the device

756
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
Because

757
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:34,688
Once I'd gotten to know a little bit better and feel how it affected me everyday

758
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,504
Since they were pretty much all over the house

759
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
I realize that

760
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,600
I would not mind having one of my room

761
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,416
Because there were some things I noticed about my house

762
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,488
And that Alexa could fix

763
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:54,912
I like to listen to music when I'm doing homework or studying or playing and

764
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,728
Designed to play music

765
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,312
No not really

766
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,360
What if I put a smart light bulb

767
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,736
Well maybe I'll sneak one in there and see what happens

768
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,088
Andrew what have you added or what if we added that

769
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,904
First of all in the Echo

770
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,536
I would say that they are helpful I'm not a huge fan of the Echo Show I believe there was this year

771
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:25,376
Compared to the regular Echo mainly downstairs

772
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
Because we have

773
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,448
Kind of the bank open downstairs

774
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,496
The Amazon Echo you know that big

775
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,288
Ring on top lights up

776
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:36,640
When it's listening for the echo show yet to be looking at it to know if it's listening or not

777
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:43,040
And I've also found that the sound quality isn't as good because it doesn't have the the speakers going all the way around

778
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,064
I'm also

779
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:50,720
If Google home had all the connections at the same time as early as Alexa I would say the Google home

780
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,536
Is better because it's so much better at search

781
00:29:54,048 --> 00:30:00,192
Write them in there so many questions that I think are fairly simple that Alexa can't answer that Google can and Google seems to

782
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
Understand

783
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,520
My questions better than

784
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,312
The Madam a does as well

785
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:11,712
As far as new things in the home while the June oven obviously is nice another one was pretty simple.

786
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,528
Share but it's a huge help which is you put in that

787
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,296
Connected

788
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,600
Switch for the under cabinet

789
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,624
Kitchen light

790
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,328
And connected to a pair of fluorescent bulbs that we have

791
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,864
Several fluorescent bulbs

792
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
So we had on our kid

793
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,496
Right and so it did two things for us one is

794
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:39,104
And when you've got your hands dirty with food and instead of reaching for that switch

795
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,224
Turn on the under cab lights you can just ask Madam a to turn them on at the other thing is

796
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,992
Bad habit

797
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,528
Leaving house lights on

798
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:51,392
And since they were connected where is the rest of kitchen lights were connected I got yelled at by

799
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
Not not yet

800
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,768
I got in trouble with a certain someone for leaving those lights on

801
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,352
When she would be going to bed and ask matamata turn off

802
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,192
The lights downstairs knows want to go off and then she'd have to walk over and do it so

803
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
That was help

804
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
All is well

805
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,800
All right helps you with your bad habits

806
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
And also

807
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Just make life

808
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
Yay

809
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,944
Okay we also this year went through

810
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,224
Couple different thermostat

811
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,784
I say we had a Honeywell T5

812
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
For a while

813
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,112
And

814
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,184
Have historically had an ecobee smart SI

815
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,232
And then I just put it in a thermostat

816
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:30,048
From Luxe products which is a sponsor of the show

817
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
To try that out

818
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,632
And we also upstairs have a nest

819
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:37,984
So given that we played with a lot of different thermostats I'm actually curious like

820
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,824
Does it even matter what smart thermostat you have or do you even care if you

821
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,848
Your thermostat smart

822
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,664
I just want something that works

823
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,504
You know it and frankly even if I just have to program it

824
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,880
If it has it's kind of a smart away future that's enough for me that thing that bothered

825
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:59,744
Me about the nest is when it decides on its own that would be more comfortable at a certain temperature

826
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,144
And it plays with it and then the middle of the night you get really hot I guess there was a bug on that this year fire caulk

827
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,912
Correctly

828
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,960
Slasher

829
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:14,592
I guess the answer is the basics I need I need an app on my phone so I can adjust the temperature

830
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,384
They were out of town

831
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,504
It needs to be easy to program when we want it to be certain temperatures

832
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
And

833
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:26,112
Really that's that's about it as long as it's working that's good

834
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
And

835
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,232
And I feel like we should do it connected toys this year

836
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,536
We've kind of spent most of your time just hanging out of the car

837
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
Computer instead

838
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,376
So are there any features or anything

839
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,192
Exciting that you like you actually like the Echo Show

840
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:46,336
Yes I like the Echo Show because I feel like it's a bit more interactive send

841
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,128
Other lights as because

842
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,152
You can ask

843
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,456
Steve information

844
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:55,040
And it gives you prompts for what to say when your just like

845
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,088
Well what else can Alexa do

846
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,880
And you can actually

847
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,440
CM Punk's and you can just look at it

848
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,232
Are the time instead of just

849
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
Having to ask

850
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
Madame payforit

851
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:11,936
And it's also helpful when you got like recipes or something that's pulled up because you can just

852
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
Look at it rather than

853
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,776
Haven't got you other

854
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
Trouble because

855
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
It's just

856
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,128
Like a voice programmed iPad

857
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,944
A couple times I called you guys while I was out of town

858
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,992
And I drop in on you on the echo

859
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,528
How did you guys

860
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
It was

861
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,672
Strange to see the sudden transformation of like a screen

862
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,488
Intuiface from distances away

863
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
And

864
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:40,096
It was kind of strange to know that the camera on Alexa

865
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
Stampwithbrian

866
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
Casting us

867
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:46,496
To somewhere else but I thought it was a nice feature because

868
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
We could talk

869
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,312
/ serial

870
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
No

871
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,944
You know they took the Amazon and Google who owns YouTube are in a fight

872
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:59,808
Which is why we can't watch her Corgi videos do you feel like this out loud

873
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,856
I know without that

874
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
Do you think

875
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,672
TV show is still worth it

876
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,488
That is a very tough question because

877
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:11,584
What are my priorities on it was that I was able to watch

878
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
Crazy videos on YouTube

879
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:17,216
I feel like the other stuff adds up and makes up for it

880
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,240
Because

881
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,776
Even though

882
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,360
Madam is having some conflicts with

883
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:27,712
Partners and stuff it doesn't limit its abilities to full extent

884
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,016
All right what about things that didn't work

885
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,320
I can think of one Gadget

886
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,856
It is driving my entire family

887
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,184
It's currently driving us crazy

888
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
I'll give you a hint

889
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
Cleverpet

890
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
Yes

891
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,888
To be fair this is

892
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Cleverpet

893
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,424
Pet feeder

894
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,728
It's designed for people who are not at home

895
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
For their pets

896
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,288
Still like entertain themselves during

897
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:57,920
But since my family is off at home since we had it over the Thanksgiving holidays and some other days were

898
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,968
Still in the house

899
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,016
Treatment to find itself unplugged

900
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Quite a bit

901
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Well

902
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
Once or twice

903
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,672
But it is very annoying if you're sitting there in every

904
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,976
10 to 30 seconds it's making it

905
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,768
Loud mechanical noise

906
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,328
And our dog doesn't seem to appreciate it either

907
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
Okay I don't think she's learning

908
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
Skyrim

909
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,216
It's possible that our dog is

910
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,312
Okay what other gadgets any other things that we saw this year that

911
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
You guys were like

912
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,360
I want some of that

913
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,152
Why don't we have this installed

914
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
Or

915
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,456
Please take this out of my house

916
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:36,832
One thing I have noticed this year is that our internet seems to be working well and I think

917
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,856
I don't remember when we play

918
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:44,256
Put the first-generation erosion in the second generation but and I don't know if that's it but I was having lots of connect

919
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:48,352
Tivity issues before that and it seems to be going really well the past

920
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
6 to 12 months

921
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
Will give ear of the credit for that

922
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
Cuz yeah you definitely have some

923
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
Your computer does

924
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
Did not like steak

925
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:59,616
It didn't another thing to is a device I rarely used

926
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:06,016
But when I do use it it's extremely helpful and that's the Chamberlain MyQ for the garage door for example when your car was in

927
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,808
Rashad we had the loaner car

928
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,112
Didn't have the garage door opener or the

929
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
The Homelink

930
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,952
And so being able to open up the app

931
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,232
And select

932
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:19,840
Might see you in just open the garage door that way was helpful especially because we have such

933
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:26,240
A sloped driveway so to actually park it and get out and go into the garage and open it isn't all that easy so

934
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,776
That was very helpful as well

935
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
And speaking of the Mikey

936
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
Do they actually have added

937
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,152
A feature that would integrate it with like if

938
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:37,248
Or even like maybe your Google home and what it is is you would pay

939
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
Buck extra each month or

940
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,808
$10 a year

941
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,856
Right now we don't subscribe to

942
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,696
To any of these things but I'm very curious if you think there would be value

943
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
In

944
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,512
One of those types of subscriptions or maybe

945
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,792
Cloud-based camera system

946
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,704
It's a good question you know one thing we've done recently as go through look at all of our subscriptions in because they do that

947
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,752
And see which ones were actually using

948
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:05,152
I need to keep I can't think of anything off the top my head with the MyQ where I'm like oh I wish I could do this or that

949
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:10,272
That that said a lot of times you know I didn't think I needed voice activated stuff before the Alexa camera

950
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,136
So you know sometimes it's what you actually get it that you realize how valuable it is

951
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,928
Security cameras

952
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:22,304
I guess if they would record for a little bit longer or keep it store longer but for the most part

953
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,704
We would know if we need a recording pretty quickly after it happens right if we were robbed or something like that we would know

954
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,032
No I can't think of anything off top my head run like

955
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,104
I would pay a monthly fee for this at the same time

956
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,896
I'm sure there are some things that

957
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
Would add value that I

958
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,968
Say yes let's pay for it

959
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
Okay

960
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,528
Because you are young

961
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,064
You are the voice of the future

962
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
Can you come with your own theme music

963
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,672
In your Ideal World

964
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,976
What do you think the house that you live in

965
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,256
Like 20 years

966
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
10 years

967
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,584
What do you think how do you think it reacts to

968
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,632
In the future

969
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:02,496
It really depends because I feel like the way technology is going it's going to be

970
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,288
A lot more customizable

971
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
Journey

972
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,920
Brilliant light

973
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,200
Being in control

974
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
Troll

975
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,040
Less than being able to

976
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,320
Talk to things

977
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
So

978
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856
I like

979
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,928
Having easily access

980
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,464
Too late

981
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,000
And control

982
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
So

983
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,584
It's pretty clear that this year was The Big Year for

984
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,888
Voice to become a smart home interface

985
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
Since we've been

986
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,752
When is it worked and when does

987
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,592
Well it's very helpful I think for lights

988
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,616
In general

989
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:44,736
Especially when your hands are full or in our case now we can we're going to bed we can just

990
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:49,600
Come upstairs and say turn off downstairs we also added the television

991
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,160
Thing this year what is that called

992
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,000
Logitech Harmony Hub which is kind of nice when you

993
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:02,656
You having a glass in your hand and you're heading over to the living room to watch TV to tell it to turn on the television

994
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:06,240
And have the TV and the Roku and everything just kind of boo'd up

995
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,544
I will say that it still seems like

996
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,568
Matinee

997
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,104
Miss carries us

998
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
A lot

999
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:18,272
And it's not getting any better in fact I feel like as we had more devices it gets worse because she gets confused

1000
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,296
Between them

1001
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,088
And so you know a lot of time she asks

1002
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:24,672
For clarification and it just seems so far off from what we were asking

1003
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,464
Well let me ask you this guy's

1004
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,280
What if I swapped out Madame A4

1005
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
Haji

1006
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,424
I like the idea that the one thing I don't like

1007
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
About the

1008
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
The Google

1009
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,496
Is that

1010
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
It has soy

1011
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,384
I mentioned the Alexa has that ring of lights on top so you know and it's listening

1012
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
The Google home on the other hand has a slope top

1013
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,248
And it lights up a little bit

1014
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,552
But if it's facing away from you

1015
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,624
If the slope is going the other way you can't tell if it's listening

1016
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,768
So that's one downside but I'd I totally be up for trying like a swap downstairs and seeing how it works

1017
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,304
We did it for a little bit

1018
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,328
Hugh

1019
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,144
Well was that

1020
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,192
When we had the regular matinee

1021
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:08,960
Yes

1022
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:13,312
Cuz I think my big complaint with the Google was that I didn't know if it was

1023
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,104
If it hurt us or not

1024
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,176
Where is the matinee we could see that it was listening

1025
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,480
Alright any gadgets on your wishlist

1026
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,016
Oh I have one

1027
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,040
It's about the

1028
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,624
It comes in and actually sets up the expensive thing we have that

1029
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,208
Makes our Shades go down automatically and allow us to control them

1030
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
Every year

1031
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,280
I just I just want to give you something

1032
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:38,400
The house of 15 or 20 years from now it'll actually be set up

1033
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,216
In anything that you're excited about or think would be fun

1034
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,240
Onion

1035
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,056
Smart toys these days

1036
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:48,640
They're getting more and more interactive and I really

1037
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,224
Appreciate that because it's not just so if I press

1038
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
This

1039
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,528
Something happened

1040
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,320
Get you deeper into like

1041
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:02,720
So if I do this combination that it's going to interact with me that I can interact back and it

1042
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:06,816
Billy tentative sets Your Horizon towards a bigger goal when

1043
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,888
You're playing and learning about tech

1044
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,448
Was it last year that we got the

1045
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Robot

1046
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,312
As I would call it the 7 minutes away

1047
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,616
It was kind of a sentence like a

1048
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
But yes

1049
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
Yes

1050
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Cosmo

1051
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,688
Cosmo

1052
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,040
Yep the kids toys that you continue to play with the specialist

1053
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,576
They cost over $100

1054
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,136
Because when it's aimed towards kids

1055
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:35,744
The main goal is not to show off the technology that's behind it

1056
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
Its 2

1057
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,560
Use that technology

1058
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,608
And utilize it to keep

1059
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,168
The buyer or purchaser Entergy

1060
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
Because

1061
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,264
Cosmo had some really advanced technology

1062
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,312
Where it was using

1063
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,104
Multiple codes to get

1064
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,711
A full body function over robot so that could do all these tricks

1065
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
But it really do

1066
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,551
Keep you as entertaining

1067
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,575
Because

1068
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,367
It was more about

1069
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,671
Wow we figured out this Tech words

1070
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:09,279
Info control everybody in it can do all the stuff and lasts about

1071
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,839
Let's interact with that let's play with it

1072
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:16,703
Hey you didn't have fun playing the cube stacking game with them I thought it was just that he didn't have enough

1073
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
That was

1074
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,823
Also part of it because in the long time run

1075
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,687
Could not keep you that entertain because you did have some interactive things with it

1076
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:30,015
But a lot of the time it was last

1077
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,063
Let's interact with it let's

1078
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,087
T-shirts.

1079
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,367
Amor

1080
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,951
Let's go over the things that learned and see

1081
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,487
How cool they are

1082
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,815
You guys think so much for a talk

1083
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,119
Living in a smart home

1084
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
The last year

1085
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,167
Again

1086
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:51,519
Are we don't have a choice I mean I mean our pleasure

1087
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
Great

1088
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,103
Pleasure can I have a corgi now

1089
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:02,271
