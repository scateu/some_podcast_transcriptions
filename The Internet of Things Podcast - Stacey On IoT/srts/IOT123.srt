00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,520
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,544
This is your house

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,848
Stacey Higginbotham and this is our co-host

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,872
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:20,992
We have got an amazing show for you today we're going to focus on Defcon hacks

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,296
We've got questions about how

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,112
I could driving is going to work we got a bunch of news bit

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,160
Including week being sold

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,952
To William

10
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,512
We got a Q&A from one of our readers

11
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,584
And we're going to highlight and improbable iot product

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,864
This week because

13
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:40,448
It's really improbable and after all of that

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,032
We will have a message from our sponsor Hyksos Solutions

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,312
I want to hear about them

16
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:52,736
Our Guest this week is Sam George who's in charge of Microsoft Azure iot efforts

17
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:57,088
About a lot of industrial and Enterprise iot

18
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:57,856
Information

19
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,624
So

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,928
Stick around for all of that and now

21
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:07,328
Another one of our sponsors this week and they are launching their

22
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,728
2nd generation mesh wi-fi system these new aero systems contain one

23
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,800
KIRO that is in the older square shape

24
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,384
And when did you begin switch are mesh access points

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,784
They also have cool features like a night like they're smaller and you can put them just about anywhere you just plug

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,600
Right in there is no pork

27
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:35,744
You will also be able to buy individually rozar begins to add to your current system they are fully backwards compatible

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
So for example I spend

29
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
$149 and I bought additional Beacon to put in my hallway to improve cover

30
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,264
Average for my Wi-Fi doorbells because they needed it

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,104
So the original system containing one zero and two beacons

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,504
Starts at the 399 again this is for people who are in the market for a mesh wi-fi system

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,904
I have one I have the Eros I have loved them for a long time and the new system is faster so

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,304
You may want to start adding New pieces I don't know what I like about them it's just so easy to extend your mesh Network

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,376
So you can see just like you said saw them into an outlet

36
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,424
And boom got insulin coverage

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,984
Cuz you got backwards compatibility if you have the old Euro

38
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
So if you are interested you can go to www Eero that is eat

39
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,944
Ero.com

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,344
And with this code Stacy and I encourage

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
Go out

42
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:41,536
Grab some of these and tell them that we sent you all right

43
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Back to the show

44
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,496
Lots of hacking to talk about

45
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Besides

46
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Actually

47
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,360
Big hacking conference in Las Vegas

48
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,176
And we learned a lot of things

49
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Such as

50
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
I think we learned about the Amazon Echo getting hacked

51
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
I don't know if that happened at Defcon but

52
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,112
It was definite there's always a lot of Newsroom

53
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,952
Yeah it happened around the same time as death, don't think it happened

54
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
During the fire at Defcon but

55
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
This is

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,424
At first it's concerning but it's a little less concerning once I explain what the heck actually is and what it takes

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,752
Actually a security researcher has been able to

58
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
Show

59
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,824
That he can take over

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,920
The microphone of Amazon Echo not an echo dot or an echo

61
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,760
How are you going to vacuum the only on the Amazon Echo

62
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
The original one

63
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
And

64
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,208
He can listen in and have the audio that it captures sent to a server Elser and you don't even know

65
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
Now

66
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,792
Again that sounds concerning and it should be

67
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
However

68
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,192
Newer Echoes are not affected by the hack so if you have an echo

69
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
Check and see the

70
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,128
That is packaging with the device itself and if there's a 2017 on it and the model number and ending in 02

71
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,664
It is not vulnerable

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
Anything else he's vulnerable

73
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
However

74
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
To actually

75
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Implemented

76
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,600
He or somebody would need to

77
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:14,720
To have physical access to your Echo and we need some time to manipulate the files on it

78
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,303
There's a root exploit that he would need to use

79
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,863
So if nobody's coming out of your house

80
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:26,495
Oh my God it's like it's like the 21st century version of like having the Russian spies come in and plug your place

81
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
There you go

82
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
There you go

83
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
Dapsone

84
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
I would say

85
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,711
Fret too much about this I don't know if Amazon can actually fix this with

86
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:40,831
A firmware update though that's that's the more concerning parked me some the older Echoes witch

87
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
Mine was bought by

88
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,975
Before this year's I'm sure it's vulnerable and Stacey I'm sure yours is to

89
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
Mine was first off the line

90
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,583
Yeah I'm not sure that can be fixed

91
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
I'm okay with that

92
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
I figured

93
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,447
So in addition to

94
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
Your Amazon Echo could be hacked freakout

95
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,383
We also have car washes could be hacked this is actually from Defcon and

96
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
These researchers

97
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
Showed that

98
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,247
They could find access to automatic

99
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,063
Car washes online I bet they're using chaudin

100
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
To be honest it what happened is

101
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
They can find these car washes

102
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,071
And they could gain control of them lock a vehicle in them and then beat the vehicle with the robotic washing arm

103
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,167
That's very it is a very scary thing to have happen I am sure

104
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,263
But the reason this is happening is because

105
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:37,151
These car washes are online and they didn't change the password so like if you own a car wash

106
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,735
And you invested in the automated thing maybe change your password

107
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,015
That's going to help a lot

108
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,807
Which then brings us

109
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
2

110
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:50,975
Oh my God it's 2017 and we're still having to tell people to change their password but maybe next year we won't

111
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,559
Because there is new iot security legislation

112
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
Proposed Hindi

113
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
Send it

114
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
Go Far Kid

115
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,799
I wonder if they're listening to us because I think it's the last two or three episodes we've been

116
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823
Talking about

117
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,639
Potential consumer protection legislation for

118
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Smart devices

119
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
And

120
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:17,087
This is a step is a baby step in and there's no guarantees that the legislation is going to pass but it wouldn't surprise

121
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
Crazy because it's very minimal

122
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
What is a bipartisan legislation

123
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:27,327
That would prohibit vendors from offering up devices that have unchangeable password switch

124
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,399
It's good you should be able to change your password if you purchase something

125
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,727
And or possess known security vulnerabilities

126
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:39,615
I dread that separate article about this aside from the Reuters one that I'm looking at right now and I believe it said

127
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,663
It would also

128
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,991
Require the devices to be firmware updatable

129
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Remotely

130
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
So

131
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
Again

132
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,855
That's kind of a given her mostly

133
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,671
Devices today but still

134
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:59,071
Tire vendors that provide internet connected equipment to the US government to ensure their products are patchable Income form

135
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
Industries

136
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:06,239
Well G look look out for the government not for the people

137
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,775
Allows federal agencies

138
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,359
Ask the US Office of the OMB Office of Management and budget

139
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,199
Buy non-compliant devices

140
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,527
If other controls such as Network segmentation

141
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,879
So most of these I'm like wow this is like the bare minimum it doesn't hurt

142
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
It does expand

143
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,303
Directions for cyber researchers who are working in good faith to hack

144
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
Which is a big deal because

145
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,703
You know I don't know if you guys remember but Oracle used to sue hackers

146
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Like all the time

147
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
Regretted

148
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,311
There's this whole kind of idea

149
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,663
I don't know if these are controversial still that they used to be because people would be like

150
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,735
Why don't you just tell us where

151
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,015
King of Thieves hacked

152
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
Why do we have to pay you

153
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,367
In kind of felt a little extortionist

154
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
2 News

155
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,511
It's a good incentive though it is it's actually one of the things I tell people to look for

156
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,351
If you're going to buy a connected home product or a connected device

157
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,959
Look for companies that have bug bounties because it does mean that they are serious about

158
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,007
More serious about security

159
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:18,943
J4 getting on board I would like to see consumer protections I would like to see the FTC and able to expand consumer

160
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
Productions in this area

161
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,527
This looks like it's only the

162
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
Yeah I think you're right

163
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,367
But it's a start

164
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:31,231
So you know who knows if we're going to get anything passed Congress has been kind of

165
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
Analysts call it divided

166
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,423
This is legislation in the Senate they're going to introduce similar legislation in the house will have to happen is they're going to talk about it send it to committee

167
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
If it makes it out of committee

168
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,543
Hold on versions of it who knows what else will get stuck in there

169
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
And then maybe

170
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Maybe it will

171
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
There's a lot left

172
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
So it may dying

173
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Haley StarTalk

174
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Yep

175
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
Let's move on to other

176
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
Specifically how are

177
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
Cars

178
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
Talk to them

179
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
What will they talk

180
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:10,399
Well I remember way back when you and I were for gigaom I remember our colleague Katie foreign-backed listen to a bunch

181
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
To research and stories on cars

182
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
Using a specific

183
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,311
Wi-Fi protocol to talk to each other member that

184
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,359
Yes it was the vehicle to vehicle

185
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Communication

186
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
I don't remember which

187
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:29,599
80802 something something I don't remember but obviously since then

188
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
345 years ago since then

189
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
Autonomous vehicles

190
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
Have really

191
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,279
Jose taken off you know there's a lot of momentum in that area

192
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
Which is awesome

193
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,447
But there's a lot of other things on the road that are not cars on the side of the road which yes

194
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Carson see them

195
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
But you also have

196
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,079
Bicycles especially in a lot of urban areas

197
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,151
You have scooters and motorcycles so on

198
00:09:53,919 --> 00:10:00,063
And none of these things talk to the cars the cars may even have problems identifying number of deserting them from pedestrians

199
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,927
So there's a researcher out of Carnegie Mellon

200
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,255
Who says hey you know cars have a regular pattern with the way they move

201
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,303
People right when people riding bicycles

202
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,143
The chain between acting like cars on side of the road or they might

203
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,239
Look up on the sidewalk

204
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
Journey Don't Stop at stop sign

205
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
This is true

206
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
I know I know I know I'm guilty

207
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
I myself am I my road bike

208
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,967
But you're actually right there they're not as predictable

209
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
As a car

210
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
When you look at it that way

211
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:35,647
What the researcher is doing is he actually loaded up a bicycle with lidar and radar and

212
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
Cameras everything else and he's trying to

213
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Create data

214
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,839
That maybe they can add to the algorithms to the cars that say hey

215
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,935
That's really a bike and here's what you need to be careful for it may not stop at the stop sign

216
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Everything But Water

217
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:53,823
You know it's not a pedestrian so it might have different rules that it has been applied to it and so on

218
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
So it's kind of interesting

219
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:01,759
I'm intrigued by this because I do ride a road cycle quite a bit I'm actually going for my motorcycle permit

220
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
Probably next week

221
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,599
In hopes of buying a large scooter

222
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
And

223
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,951
Part of me says he has a great idea but the thing is

224
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,999
Bicycles are not battery powered

225
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,351
And you're going to need battery power constant battery power for

226
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
Bikes to be able to speak to cars

227
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,215
Free sample if they want to say hey I'm over here doing come in my lane or whatever

228
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
And I don't know how that's going to work

229
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
Me either

230
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
So

231
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
Disappointed

232
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,223
There are lots of USB powered bike

233
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
Accessories

234
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
So I can see a couple

235
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
ICU addon

236
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
Very curious about

237
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:44,255
Like motion kinetic energy harvesting from a bike

238
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
Possible short

239
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,095
So could you power something that way

240
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:54,751
It's kind of got to be foolproof if for example eventually and I'm thinking far ahead here

241
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Eventually there's a

242
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,359
Alert on your bike at says hey there's a car coming

243
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,919
Very close to you from behind or something like that you know

244
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
Is it bench I could see all the sensors that are in cars

245
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
Mitchell way down to

246
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
Motorcycles and bicycles

247
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
But the latter work you've got to have constant power

248
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
Champion sometimes I power and sometimes I don't

249
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,255
You'll have is constant power

250
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
From a battery

251
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
And I was just

252
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,375
You'll have that constant power for a set amount

253
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Time

254
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,727
You'll be able to go on a 4-Hour bike ride with those features

255
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,543
Tonight anything else you're going to be back in the Dark Ages

256
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
This is Mike my hunch

257
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,615
I think it's think about it they had like

258
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,039
You know where they were trying to do a heads-up display that was all powered on a helmet

259
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,367
You know so that was charged and then

260
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
I don't know how long it would have lasted

261
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:50,559
I can see this happening I think things like electric bikes like in China right now those are surely

262
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,119
Super big so I think those kind of things might

263
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Become part of that

264
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,471
It honestly because those are valuable safety

265
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
Repeaters

266
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,079
It does kind of get into this bigger discussion about

267
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
How will Design the roads are they

268
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
The future in life

269
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:09,247
Right away who will talk to whom in that sort of thing to think about

270
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
The rules for cars

271
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Nice purses

272
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:19,487
Baby bikes and pedestrians insomnia

273
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
In terms of

274
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,815
Population

275
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,399
So cars with autonomous I'll just slow the

276
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
Cuz I have

277
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
Not your second power but

278
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,287
Add a longer battery life I can totally

279
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,639
Afford taking of slow down where's the spikes got to get where it's going so

280
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Recharge

281
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,271
Right right I mean I think we're way ahead of the curve on this discussion because

282
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,831
We got to wait for all the cars become autonomous

283
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
And that's going to take time

284
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
And as you said

285
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
We may not we may not put

286
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,279
Maybe a Tipping Point where most of them are or something to that effect

287
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,631
Then I think it trickles down to the smaller vehicles I think we are ahead of the Curve

288
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:04,031
Related only because we talked about it last week member how we mention Google Glass making a comeback and Industrial and such

289
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:09,663
I'm actually thinking of on retiring my Google Glass to wear under my motorcycle helmet

290
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,223
Pacifically for a heads-up display for directions

291
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:19,135
Oh that feels like it was going to hurt your Bridge of your nose let me know how that works I have customized custom lenses

292
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,463
Is already inserted into custom glass frames for glasses

293
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
Sony came out

294
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,303
Oh yeah. Yeah you couldn't wear glasses with

295
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
But now

296
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,631
You can do that so

297
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,215
I look forward to hearing back from you on your both motorcycle test

298
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Experiment

299
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
Let's get to the news bits portion

300
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
The show

301
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
Real quick

302
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Eero

303
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
Hey we talked about them earlier

304
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,295
They are sponsored they acquired the thing to do it so last week

305
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
We said

306
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Dington

307
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Add shutdown

308
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,999
Kind of wanted to be an OS for the smart home well it turns out

309
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Tom Coates and Matt Build-Off

310
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,655
T2 Founders and the only two employees I know of is

311
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
They have been

312
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Aqua hired

313
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,311
And no one's talking much about what they're doing their butt

314
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,359
I look forward to it cuz

315
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,711
Like I said those guys are super smart and very thoughtful about living in

316
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,295
A connected home and how people interact

317
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
The connected home and how it's not a one-to-one

318
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,671
Other news tracker

319
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
Jose track r

320
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
The Bluetooth tracker company

321
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,559
I don't know what else to call it it helps you find yourself

322
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
50 million dollars

323
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
They compete with

324
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Sceptile

325
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,031
I am interested in them because they have this product called tracker at

326
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,359
This is not out yet it was supposed to be out this summer so far

327
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:47,967
Not out yet but you plug these little plugs in there like Bluetooth

328
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
And they have an echo skill

329
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
So what happened

330
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
You plug the sit-in then

331
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,927
It knows what room things are in so you can say hey

332
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,999
Anime where is my wallet

333
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
It'll be like it is

334
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Set the living room

335
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
But you know

336
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
It's great know where to start

337
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,775
I mean we'll see what happens when this product comes out of still available for pre-order as you said it's not out yet

338
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,591
But I'm scratching my head on this one because

339
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:21,247
I'm all for using Bluetooth as a location device I have some trackers that I purchased before SM tiles as well

340
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
But moving everything

341
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
To these two outlets

342
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:31,999
I just don't see the point of it because it really replicates what you should be able to do with your phone and a Tracker app

343
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Meaning

344
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,327
You got the processing power on your phone

345
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
Two algorithmically figure out the

346
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,703
Signal strength of where a Bluetooth tracker is

347
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,007
And she kind of navigate you too

348
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,311
Great room without these things might

349
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,223
I think you might be right I think there might be like a Powertrain the people might be upset about also you've got to sell more Hardware

350
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
In the iot connected business model

351
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,623
I get the I get the business model

352
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,695
Don't know that makes sense and I would also say

353
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,023
I read about this company a couple of weeks ago it's called switch

354
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
They make Outlets

355
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
So I actually kind of like

356
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,983
One day we're going to have all of this in our outlets and by God that's going to be a beautiful day

357
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,543
Until then we may have to buy things that we

358
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,615
Plug-In or in Kevin's case we will just hope

359
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
What you downloaded

360
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
It doesn't for us

361
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
So

362
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
That's tracker other news

363
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Wink

364
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Was sold

365
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
William

366
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,879
Who is not just a rap star and

367
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
Outkast I was like

368
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
Not the Outlaws

369
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
Not the Fugees

370
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Outkast

371
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:41,887
I was a member of Outkast and he also used to work for Intel as they're like creative

372
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,215
Technology Ambassador guy

373
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
It didn't go in

374
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,311
William has bought wink

375
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
The smart home platform

376
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,383
Flex Flex

377
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
Kevin

378
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
Is not happy

379
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
Did I say that out loud

380
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
Especially my inner monologue

381
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
Sorry about your inner monologue

382
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
Look I mean as a very happy wink owner

383
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,279
I mean I could have gone with a bunch of different platforms but I've

384
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,839
I'm stuck with wink because it doesn't work well for me

385
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,887
That was already sad when flexbot

386
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Wink

387
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,239
Is a maiko what's going to happen now you know but everything seemed to be okay

388
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,823
And it was and now it's going to William

389
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,175
Who just my opinion does not have a very solid track record in the tech space

390
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,759
I remember when he came out with its wearable and I'm like please

391
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
Come on it was it was terrible

392
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
Minute you can't even get it now so

393
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,695
That tells you everything you need to know I I just I don't have confidence in

394
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,999
Disability and hopefully he's surrounded himself with

395
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
With good people

396
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,303
And

397
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
The wink

398
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,631
Hardware and services and software

399
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:51,519
Continue to expand but I just was not happy when I heard this news

400
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,895
Nathan Smith the former CTO a twink who is in charge of

401
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,223
He's actually gone over to Amazon

402
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
Another fellow that

403
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,295
I won't say his name

404
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
He's nice but he's one of the

405
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
People who

406
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,671
Have been a twink forever

407
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Just left

408
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
For another job

409
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:19,679
I think we are going to have to I mean I'm willing to see but I think we might when people tell us they want a hub

410
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,727
We usually said if your

411
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,823
You're not really into like playing around and working real hard

412
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103
Wink is the way to go

413
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,919
We may change that recommendation going

414
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Forward back

415
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
SmartThings although it is

416
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,831
We'll talk about this in another show cuz we're running out of time but

417
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,135
It is also an indication of where the Hummer

418
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
It is

419
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
So

420
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Lot's happened

421
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
Speaking up hugs

422
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,631
We asked you guys for questions and by God you delivered

423
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
So

424
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
We're going to take

425
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
A question

426
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,239
This week from

427
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,775
Tom brincefield

428
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,871
And this is a good question summarize at a little bit

429
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,943
So he's got a Google home and he is

430
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
Currently looking for things to automate

431
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:10,111
So he's got a Google home Philips Hue hubs and three color bulbs and a WeMo switch

432
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
Farmers porch lighting

433
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
So

434
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
He has

435
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,815
A problem though he wants to automate a fluorescent light over his kitchen sink

436
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,911
But it doesn't have a neutral wire so I can't use the WeMo switch

437
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,215
He wants is getting voice control

438
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,775
And remote control of that light

439
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
Second

440
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:35,711
He has a dumb monitor plasma TV a Samsung Blu-ray player and an older tuner that he run sound through

441
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,271
As well as the Chromecast audio for music

442
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
None of these work with voice control

443
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,951
Also is there any method that we know of that could give him the ability to turn these things on and switch some settings

444
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
Especially on the tuner

445
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
So

446
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
Tom

447
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,095
I feel like we got really good news for you

448
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
But it is going to cost you

449
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
That's usually how it works

450
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
Self

451
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:03,103
Your lighting question is so common that I actually knew automatically where to send you and

452
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
I did it myself

453
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
Sort of

454
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
Because

455
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,599
You want to have voice control and because you're dealing with a fluorescent which a lot of the kind of automated immersed

456
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
Don't

457
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
Fluorescence

458
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,976
I'm going to steer you to the Lutron system

459
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,792
For there on off switch

460
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:27,168
Because this is the only thing I know of that you can use without a neutral wire

461
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704
It's still get voice

462
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,776
So what you're going to need in this is really important

463
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,616
Is the Lutron pd5 WS

464
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,432
/ DD / White

465
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
Actually the wh stands for white

466
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,528
So if you need an almond

467
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,112
But it's the Lutron PD 5ws

468
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
Slash TV

469
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
The five stamps

470
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
For 5 a.m.

471
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,256
And this is important because they have a 6 amp

472
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,072
26 AMP one requires a neutral wire

473
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,120
So you have to get the V amp

474
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,960
And you can order this Amazon has a really high price on it right

475
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,752
I ordered by and for

476
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,824
Like 65 Amazon bright now showing a hundred bucks for the

477
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
What you'll do is you

478
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
Pop the switch in

479
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,224
You're also going to need the Lutron Hub which is about $80

480
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
So

481
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:20,160
Then you got voice control of your fluorescent lights and I have mine for my under cabinet lighting

482
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,464
My husband always left on and I love it

483
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,512
I also have a lot of other Lutron switches

484
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,584
If you want to go that way

485
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
Go that way

486
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
I will tell you I am very hot

487
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,240
So that is the answer to your lighting question

488
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
For your television

489
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
Question

490
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,872
This what I thought was kind of tricky

491
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,176
But it actually wasn't

492
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
Stacy figure this out

493
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,736
Before the show

494
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
It looks like the

495
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,600
Only way might be to add yet another Hub and that would be the Harmony Hub

496
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,440
This is about

497
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
65

498
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
This is a

499
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
Little

500
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
I have one

501
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,864
I saw this conversation

502
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
Now before you buy it

503
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,984
You can either buy it and see if it works

504
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,288
Logitech has a list

505
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:13,664
Oldest tuners in stuff that support so because you didn't tell me what your tuner was I couldn't look it up

506
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
But but but

507
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
It does work with

508
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
Most

509
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,320
IR compatible devices yes

510
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,880
It has an eye it actually comes with a little IR blaster

511
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,952
This makes my husband go nuts

512
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,744
We had to put the

513
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
GoNoodle

514
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,072
It goes in our

515
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
AV cabinet

516
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
Under eye television

517
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
Total Wireless

518
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
Next to it

519
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
Because we don't have a

520
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,152
But it won't let me drill a hole in

521
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
I can fix that little

522
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:52,576
The other thing to note is for your Chromecast audio. 100% sure this is going to work

523
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
Kevin found

524
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
What did you find

525
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,744
I did find some support

526
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,584
Questions and answers about the Chromecast and Logitech Harmony Hub and

527
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,424
The only mention Chrome Cast audio which suggests to me that it does work is

528
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,264
That Harmony Logitech rather suggest you create a

529
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
A shortcut

530
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
2

531
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Play music

532
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,432
And so on therefore it should work and in my opinion but it wouldn't tell you to create a shortcut

533
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,528
Chromecast audio play music if it didn't work so I suspect it does work

534
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,344
Probably support Chromecast

535
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
Audio it should work

536
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,184
But he has a Google home so you should be able to

537
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,232
Voice activated Chromecast audio ady

538
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
And control

539
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,560
Oh yes without even doing

540
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,376
I will say that I have my tuner setup

541
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
To play

542
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,472
Okay this is complicated but my Sonos goes through my tuner

543
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
To some of my speakers

544
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,848
I have set up a special thing

545
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,128
Special shortcut

546
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,920
Display Sonos living room

547
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
And so

548
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,296
The other nice thing is when you connect your Logitech to your Google home

549
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,368
You're going to have the option of naming the shortcut

550
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,904
Again for the Google

551
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
Or your Amazon Echo

552
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
For anyone who's

553
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,024
What do I do

554
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
So

555
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
Those are two things for you

556
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
You are going to pay

557
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,936
Let's see what brought it up to 280 so

558
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,216
300 box

559
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,008
I don't know if it's worth it

560
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
I spent

561
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
I have not

562
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
I'm crazy

563
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,016
Okay so that was a question for the week and here's our

564
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,040
Iot

565
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
Improbable device

566
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,600
Of the day

567
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,256
Is an Indiegogo campaign is for something called

568
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
Smalt

569
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
And Kevin

570
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,376
Would you like to tell us what the small tis

571
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,192
Yes we are talking about the small

572
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,240
Which stands for smart

573
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,824
Salt dispenser because of course everybody needs a smart

574
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
South

575
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
Dispenser

576
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:56,480
But it's more than just a selfish Spencer it's a centerpiece according to the Indiegogo campaign

577
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,272
You can play music through the

578
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:02,368
Integrated Bluetooth speaker you can set the mood with multicolored lighting

579
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,696
And of course the Spencers in any amount you please

580
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
I'm sorry but

581
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,792
There's just no place for Texans

582
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:14,912
This is going to be $99 for the super early bird special

583
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,472
But the actual price of a 199 when it hits

584
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,264
So it ships

585
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
March 28th

586
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,592
So we're going to have to wait awhile

587
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,152
I don't think it's going to shift at all

588
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,712
You're probably right my favorite part is

589
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
It is

590
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
To dispense

591
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,672
A tablespoon of salt but if you don't have an echo you can go in the app

592
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,952
Hindu gestures

593
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,608
Because I know when I'm dispensing salt

594
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,168
I really want to open my phone

595
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,728
Solutely

596
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,008
Absolutely

597
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,616
And I've seen decently large salt shakers before this is big

598
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,456
I'm looking at a picture of it right now and it's like a two-handed device

599
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
It is yeah this is

600
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,320
It looks like a slightly smaller it looks like a bigger tap

601
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Actually

602
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Yes

603
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Solace

604
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,208
If you've ordered one of these sentences explain why

605
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
That is stupid

606
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,192
Telus

607
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,752
Why if you were one of the backers of this product

608
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Is it

609
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
For this week show

610
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248

Lots

613
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
About it

614
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
Other teas

615
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
Now I'm just getting silly

616
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
Stay tuned

617
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,264

Are really trying to sell some the bus

633
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,144
Coyote engineering problems

634
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,472
We bring in some of the brightest software Engineers embedded

635
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,496
Systems engineer

636
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,312
And data scientists out of Eastern Europe

637
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,408
And several hundred Engineers that we have on our team

638
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,968
Over 60% of these Engineers have

639
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Either am I

640
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,760
Serious or a PhD

641
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,064
Degree many of them are still lecturing

642
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,624
In the University system in Eastern Europe

643
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,184
And actually out of all of the employees at

644
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,584
We have an Ico over 60% of the degrees are in mathematics if we have some of the brightest stars individuals that are

645
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,424
Really working on cutting-edge research and development in the area of iot

646
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,728
And it's our job to put them in touch

647
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,824
And how does an engagement with haikou happen

648
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
How does that get started

649
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Generalist

650
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,944
Peking a client is going to start with a smaller

651
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,992
Call it a pilot project

652
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,296
Where they're just going to get an opportunity

653
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,368
Is this going to be a good fit for us

654
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,440
And then really for us to why should we be working together

655
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,232
Because let's face it I can

656
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,280
Sit here and tell you how great we are in

657
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,608
Provide you with some really solid documentation that

658
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,960
It's super technical any Bill to see you like well can maybe these folks know what they're doing

659
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,520
But the reality is you need to get connected

660
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,360
And get some knowledge from them firsthand

661
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,896
Communication

662
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
10 strong

663
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,944
You can just

664
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,016
We want you to be comfortable knowing that you have a good partner

665
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,808
And until you interact with

666
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,344
The team that you can be working with

667
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
It's just really

668
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,952
Difficult to know that so you know you got a small piloting

669
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
This how we would get started

670
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,584

200 - solutions.com

680
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:24,000
Hey everyone welcome back to the

681
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:28,608
Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

682
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:33,216
Is Sam George the director of iot for Microsoft azure

683
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,008
Hi Sam how are you today

684
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,056
Great Stacy thanks for having me

685
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,384
Me and I am super excited we have had several conversations

686
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
And every single time

687
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
We have

688
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,040
Yeah I learned a lot so this time I'm excited to bring the rest of you guys listing

689
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
Along for the ride

690
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
So

691
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,392
Let's get started with

692
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,928
Conversation about

693
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
Iot architecture

694
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:56,768
So

695
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,328
You guys when we first talked

696
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,376
We had a big conversation

697
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,912
A couple years ago

698
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,448
You're a half ago about pain

699
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,752
A lot of happening in the cloud

700
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,848
I think you were looking at head of the middle area so not the edge but that

701
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,640
Middle Gateway area in your life

702
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,432
I don't know if I'll be there

703
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
And how is that change

704
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,992
Because it certainly has

705
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
Yeah when

706
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
We didn't realize

707
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
Really early on that

708
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,440
Is iot got going that there is going to be the Natural Balance

709
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
Natural

710
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,744
Equilibrium if you will

711
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,024
Between

712
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,072
Processing that happens in the cloud

713
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,120
What happens at all devices

714
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,496
And so that's always been one of that Central Central tenants

715
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
We were looking at

716
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
Reintroduced

717
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
A Gateway a c k

718
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
Last year

719
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
Just now

720
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,736
So you capabilities as well for a joke

721
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Definitely

722
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
Definitely a

723
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
Beacon Central

724
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
Docker iot

725
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:55,904
Strategy

726
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,208
How are you guys

727
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,280
Defining the edge cuz when I think of the edge I think cloud

728
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
Then I think

729
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,144
Gateway that usually on-premise and then when I think of edge I actually think of

730
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,960
No it's not necessarily sensors but maybe so

731
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568
Will you find edges anything that's

732
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,104
Capable of running

733
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,128
Intelligence

734
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
Located on physical

735
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,200
Outside the cloud

736
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
That could definitely be a gateway

737
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,344
Could definitely be an iot node or combination of the two

738
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,648
It really just depends on capabilities

739
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416
Mean

740
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,952
As you look at that

741
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,232
Spectrum of device

742
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,024
Ituc everything

743
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,840
Sensors all the way up through

744
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,400
Oblong gateways

745
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,192
And everything in between

746
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,240
And so when we think about Edge

747
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,056
We think about you know there's these waves of computing they're happy

748
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
This Cloud

749
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,360
Coyote

750
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
Leverage

751
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,688
Cloud in an edge leverages Cloud II

752
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,992
And we

753
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,832
Slightly different and iot is about sending signals from those devices

754
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,368
Attacking on the signal

755
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
Betches about

756
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,928
Pushing cop intelligence

757
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,232
Into the devices themselves

758
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
Silicon man

759
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,536
Offline

760
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,328
Are low latency loops

761
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,656
Fail-Safe systems in cases local network outages

762
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:15,264
I mean another big trend is simply just minimize any amount of data that's being transferred

763
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,336
Between devices in the cloud that's part of that equilibrium

764
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,384
Everything about between edging

765
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,456
Okay and you just threw in like a whole new

766
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,992
I don't even know what to call it

767
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,368
So

768
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
I got you

769
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,952
I got you

770
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,024
So when you're tired iot just being signaling

771
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,328
Can you help me understand what's your talk

772
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,472
Looking for example no customers doing predictive maintenance

773
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,520
Industrial Park

774
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,336
I don't want to smoke or service that are under service

775
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,896
If a device is simply just sending

776
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,176
Sheepshead sedated

777
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
The cloud and your doing

778
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,760
G'morning and analytics Fair

779
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:03,392
Need to determine the maintenance window and maybe even your shut down the machine in case of a pending failure

780
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,952
Yeah I kind of classify that usages

781
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,000
Pretty straightforward and Vanilla Ice.

782
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,560
Edge's for the vet next week where

783
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
Instead of

784
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,376
Sending all of that data to the cloud

785
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
I can't

786
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,680
Or processing

787
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
I can take

788
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,264
The processing and move it to where data is

789
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
Because

790
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,848
As machines at Society really gets going

791
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,688
These devices generate more and more and more data data has gravity

792
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,224
It's much easier to move

793
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
Computer where data is

794
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
Cutest

795
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
So

796
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,088
In this example that was

797
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,136
Just giving about industrial equipment

798
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,208
Much easier does take that cloud intelligence about

799
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,792
When do I need to shut this down or when the maintenance going to need to be adjusted

800
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
Tickets on the cloud and just

801
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,608
Right right on the

802
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:51,520
So on the IRT thing I'm thinking this is a differentiator here is there's not a real-time element

803
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,568
For the edge stuff I thinking

804
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
Real time

805
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,664
I'm thinking maybe a conservation of data

806
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
It's not making decision

807
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,552
There's no decision-making happening

808
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
Some intelligence

809
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,232
Fighting to take action

810
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,280
In an unsupervised manner

811
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,608
Okay so when I look at all these iot edge things that are

812
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
Coming

813
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,680
Count you guys have yours

814
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,216
Their competitors have

815
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,776
That's the decision

816
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
Exactly

817
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,176
Exactly now you guys work with a lot of

818
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
Big Industrial

819
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,552
Most of the big players that I talk to you there like Azure all the way

820
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:41,952
So I'm very curious because you're probably dealing with this right now this divide that they have between the it side of the house

821
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,744
In the operational side of the

822
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,280
And

823
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:49,120
I'm wondering how far the it infrastructure

824
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,912
Can actually stretch cuz

825
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
If I talk to someone like Honeywell

826
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,776
They have parts of their Factory automation

827
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,312
It's on their gear

828
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,104
On their private Network

829
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,152
And a lot of wire

830
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
So

831
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,736
I'm curious how far into that infrastructure you

832
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,016
You can go or you even want

833
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,576
But I think that's a big

834
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,856
Part of why

835
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,416
Weekly schedule such an important concept

836
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Because

837
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,000
There's many many times where you want

838
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,280
All about logic

839
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,816
Then you want to be able to

840
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,840
El Pollo Loco

841
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,936
In a local itot teams

842
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,776
You're a lot of people especially in the commercial and industrial iot space

843
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,336
Want to make sure that their data saves resident

844
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:34,944
I think that we're doing with iot Edge and also with Azure stack

845
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,224
Billy about in England

846
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,040
Who is managing these and buying them

847
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
He's inside these

848
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344
Because

849
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,392
I talked to these OT guys and they are

850
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Very smart

851
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,464
They're very smart about different things

852
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,536
What I think the typical Azure customers

853
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
Iot is the

854
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,400
Anchorman that really forces

855
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,936
Itot games

856
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,960
To work together

857
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
And

858
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,544
Your customers that have worked that out

859
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,360
It worked out that the balance between the two

860
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,152
OT teams realize

861
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,992
I keep going to be managing

862
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,576
And it teams respect the OT discipline

863
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,368
When that really works

864
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
Can you can have iot

865
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,440
Enabled for that business

866
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,792
What are some best practices that you see in your customers who are actually able to

867
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,584
What are they doing today like

868
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
Right chest pain

869
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,520
The most successful customers they don't think about it

870
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,056
Disciplining an OT different

871
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,336
I'm thinking about

872
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,920
And what happened to different phases of the car

873
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:41,248
And we'll wind up happening is it both different 1/2

874
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,296
Coordinate those rolls

875
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
So for example

876
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,600
There's a role for

877
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,392
Designing software

878
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,696
Designing a software that runs on a hardware

879
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,232
Updating that

880
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
True

881
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,864
It what's the top-rated going to be running on it and what's her update strategy

882
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,448
Taking people from both discipline and having to be accountable

883
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,008
Designing that process together

884
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,800
Helps break down some of those barriers

885
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,104
Okay how often does that actually happen

886
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,152
It really depends on the cusp

887
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:16,320
Some customers that have been around for a long long time you know for OT has been around a lot longer and it

888
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,112
That can take a long time to break down

889
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,184
It really starts with

890
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,232
Leadership and will

891
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,816
Commanded the next two teams are going to work together

892
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,120
Waterpik 150 Prime

893
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,912
I'll bring the other one along

894
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
It is the

895
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:32,960
The prime one

896
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
Is it usually OT

897
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,872
I think it really varies I'm starting to feel more more it

898
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
Actually

899
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,688
Anthony industry

900
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,992
In a world where we've got like

901
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,296
Breezy security breaches happening

902
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:52,416
And even when you know you're dealing with like compliance issues at big companies are

903
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,720
Maybe your tracking hazardous chemicals and

904
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,280
This whole iot ecosystem

905
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
How do you

906
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,584
Track

907
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
Your partner's both

908
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:04,192
Appliance perspective or just bring them on board for lie

909
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
Tracking

910
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,288
Materials I mean is it's very tough

911
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,056
So

912
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,592
What are you seeing developed

913
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,616
What are you guys thinking

914
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,152
To make that easier

915
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
Let's pick on security for a second

916
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,808
That looks like for example that you know I'm a customer I'd go pick solution and eye solution

917
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,904
And I had some partners that were involved in helping me with that are that are still operating

918
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
For me

919
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:29,280
In that situation you know you've had many hands touch their iot project

920
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,096
I'm so nope I'm at customer and I want to

921
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,400
That's the question which it should

922
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,424
Life Solutions

923
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
Cure

924
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:40,032
It's not a simple answer because there's been so many for so many different parts

925
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,568
Absolution

926
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,848
Do we handle that

927
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,408
Is with Security Programs

928
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,248
Security program for add royalty

929
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
With third-party auditors

930
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,880
That you know we train on every key that

931
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,904
You can come and inspect

932
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,952
ONN solution

933
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
Import of what we're doing there

934
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
Is

935
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,840
And we work with standards bodies around the world

936
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:07,680
And a very important one we work with this industrial internet Consortium

937
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,240
And so we recently introduced

938
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,520
Security maturity model

939
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
And the reason why

940
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,360
Is it security maturity model

941
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,128
Is

942
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,664
Answer the question of

943
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,200
Which security

944
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,528
Techniques you need to bring to bear and iot for which

945
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,808
Types of something

946
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
Because

947
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,648
We hear a lot of customers asking us to

948
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,928
Am I secure

949
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,768
And can I say that I'm certified to be secure

950
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
I like the Cure

951
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
For what

952
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,888
What specifically until you have to start talking about

953
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,240
Different types of techniques that were employed and what the security maturity model

954
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
Is a way of

955
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,336
Everyone agreeing and that's why we're doing it in a standard body

956
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,920
Is everyone agreeing in a hay for these types of scenarios

957
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,712
This level of security is

958
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
Appropriate

959
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,296
The things that we're doing on

960
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,136
But that sort of touches to your question about Hugo 6

961
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
Square

962
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,720
If there are a lot of hands and balls

963
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,536
You need to find a way to certify the thing

964
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,888
How to make sure certified the solution and make sure that it itchy the level of

965
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,912
Appliance

966
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
Security

967
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
Date of residency

968
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,776
There's also this

969
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,056
Idea of

970
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,336
It's ever-changing

971
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,640
So is new vulnerabilities

972
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,200
Pure or maybe someone shifts

973
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,016
I've talked to people who've had one of their

974
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,576
Your partner switch their underline Cloud Player

975
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,136
Right or maybe their database provider

976
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,928
All of a sudden

977
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,232
They've opened up a hole that they didn't

978
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:40,608
It may not even be security it may just be breaking some functionality further down in the chain

979
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,424
Chasing all of that

980
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,960
Is tough

981
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,752
But you can't tell people

982
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:47,776
Thou shalt

983
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,544
Change

984
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,663
And that is where Auditors come into play

985
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,479
Play this word you know there's an expert

986
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,527
Bet you make a living doing this

987
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,623
Do your partners proactively have to notify you

988
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,463
What does that so

989
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,535
Many of the solutions that we see and IRT

990
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,839
Is you'll have a partner that will develop

991
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,399
Solution

992
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,191
Coyote

993
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
Where

994
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:21,311
The partner secures devices build the solution

995
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,127
And many times operated on

996
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
So there's not

997
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:30,271
You don't get into a case where there's no lots and lots of vendors that are

998
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,087
Words that end in solution

999
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,623
Is iot

1000
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,927
Industrial iot in particular

1001
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,951
Enterprise

1002
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,487
Really scalable yet

1003
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,535
I need it feels like everything is still

1004
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,303
Fairly

1005
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
Custom

1006
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,631
Because Industries require highly specific

1007
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,215
Because you have these kind of

1008
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,519
Custom built Solutions

1009
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,055
The bear may not be hosted on

1010
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,847
Your cloud or somebody else's

1011
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
But still

1012
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,895
Yeah yeah

1013
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,431
At this point

1014
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:02,015
There's still a tremendous amount of vertical specialization

1015
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,575
And I think that there's always going to be

1016
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,111
Yeah like that degree of

1017
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
Your vertical specialization

1018
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,951
The thing that you see all of us stealing is

1019
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,279
Providing more and more functionality

1020
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,839
That reduces the amount of vertical specialization that

1021
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,727
If you were to do an iot Solutions say 5 years ago

1022
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,007
You would have

1023
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,079
Painted some virtual machines and build something custom yourself

1024
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,127
Now we have platform services

1025
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,175
Where you don't have to worry about scalability

1026
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,967
We handle that part for you

1027
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,551
You can connect devices in billions of Massachusetts

1028
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,135
That reduces the amount of vertical specialization

1029
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
And then

1030
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
They have

1031
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
You like we've introduced

1032
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
Assassin

1033
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:47,071
So that you don't even need Cloud solution development expertise in order to build

1034
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
And so

1035
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,447
Yes you're absolutely right now the iot industry is still

1036
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
Pretty nails

1037
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,543
So what you're saying and I think it a pretty rapid pace

1038
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,079
You're seeing

1039
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,687
Provide more and more functionality so that

1040
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,735
There's less specialization required

1041
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,271
I have to ask this question

1042
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,551
Chi products deep billions

1043
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,575
Millions of messages

1044
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,647
I was talking to somebody who's up for a diet

1045
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:15,999
T solution and they were actually frustrated because they couldn't find one that could handle

1046
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,047
Hundreds of millions of synchronous messages

1047
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,351
I like what that seems like a lot

1048
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:25,471
He's like well consumer Products Company

1049
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
I want

1050
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,055
I need to be able to do that

1051
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,383
I understand that

1052
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,943
What's the kind of technologies that

1053
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,967
People

1054
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
Need that we don't have yet

1055
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:41,087
So what are you guys looking for that your customers are like

1056
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,111
August 1st

1057
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
That would be cool

1058
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,463
That's a great question

1059
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,255
What are the challenges

1060
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,815
Imagine for a second that you know you could all tonight

1061
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
Solution

1062
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,887
And you know you're going to add

1063
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,423
What's a 1090 device

1064
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,983
Typically that what you see is you know

1065
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
Contact

1066
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,311
Pilot

1067
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,895
Great limited device that you know you do your scale test

1068
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,735
One of the challenges after you get all that in place

1069
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,575
Shift from being getting a solution in place

1070
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,111
To provision

1071
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,183
Impala saying software staff

1072
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,207
Things are slow

1073
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,999
You can put Asian

1074
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,791
Capacity for handling

1075
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,351
Billions of messages in minutes

1076
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:28,959
But to actually your provisionals devices and make them operational

1077
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:29,983
Cat cakes

1078
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,567
That's where you at we look at problem like that we say

1079
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,407
Hey that's a great example where we need a service it does that

1080
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,479
That's why we introduced a device provisioning service

1081
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
Tysons Corner

1082
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,527
Contact it

1083
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,319
Give permission to the right

1084
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
After service

1085
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,183
And then no download latest software operational

1086
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
Ice provisioning

1087
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,535
If you have something in the sexy sexy

1088
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,983
No it's it a lot of the stuff is is

1089
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,263
Spacek

1090
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,823
Tackling it feels like for computing problems

1091
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,407
You know a lot of people

1092
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,711
Managing hundreds of thousands of servers

1093
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
And so

1094
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,783
Okay let's take all of that

1095
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
Running

1096
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:19,903
How to do the world where we have no control over things in their devices

1097
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,671
Have not a lot of

1098
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,743
And maybe not even great network connection

1099
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
That's right

1100
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,351
Do you have any cool favorite things that people have built that you're like

1101
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
I can't believe they did this

1102
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,655
It's crazy

1103
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:34,751
My favorite right now is what Hershey's is done

1104
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,031
You know top of

1105
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,311
Add Realty

1106
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,383
If that's something they call the internet a Twizzlers

1107
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
And

1108
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,711
Actually

1109
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,527
Connected Twizzler production plant

1110
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,575
Azure iot

1111
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,855
To optimize it

1112
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
One of the challenges

1113
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:54,719
Someone like Hershey's faces when they're producing Twizzlers

1114
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
Is when

1115
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,303
Put a bunch of Twizzlers in a package

1116
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,863
It says it weighs 3 ounces

1117
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,399
It has to wait at least 3 ounces

1118
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,423
And

1119
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
Tuning your

1120
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
Factory

1121
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,007
The bad you know

1122
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,311
It produces a predictable number

1123
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,591
Twizzlers

1124
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,127
Cancer in the mouth

1125
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,919
Turns out to be a heart problem

1126
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,711
Tibetan example where

1127
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
They used

1128
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,527
Machine learning

1129
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,807
As well as

1130
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,343
Connectivity to the cloud

1131
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,903
In order to monitor

1132
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,927
Production batch

1133
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,207
Spell the liquor she's being

1134
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975
Mixton

1135
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:30,047
And so they can tuna production bat

1136
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,583
Any extruders

1137
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:32,863
To generate

1138
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,631
Precise

1139
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,447
Face of a bunch of money

1140
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,007
So we just bought some the other day

1141
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,543
And I was telling people on the team

1142
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,823
This is using our stuff

1143
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,127
I mean it's just an amazing thing

1144
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,663
Be part of an industry

1145
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,199
They compared those kind of scenario

1146
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:51,039
Okay that is awesome in on that sweet note

1147
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,063
We shall end

1148
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
The show

1149
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,599
