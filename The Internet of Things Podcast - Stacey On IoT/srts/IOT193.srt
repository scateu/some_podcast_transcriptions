Dropping acid

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,112
Low power Bluetooth

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:26,880
IP

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,672
We've got up threat report

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,488
And we're going to ask an existential question about

11
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,768
Your Smart Homes

12
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,536
Security

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,560
Plus

14
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,632
We are going to hear input from the Property Brothers

15
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,680
End

16
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,776
We got tons of news bit such as a really cool consumer premise equipment from

17
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,056
A French is

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,872
We got new smart devices for the bedroom some

19
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,640
Crazy glass

20
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,432
A $10 smart plug

21
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,712
Hi-def cameras

22
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,760
And so much more

23
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,552
Plus I'm going to tell you what I think about the

24
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
The First Alert

25
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,624
Onelink safe and sound device

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,392
That

27
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,952
Is expensive but might be worth it for some people

28
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
And I guess this week is the

29
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:08,608
Ctio of the City of Calgary she's going to be talking about how these City

30
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,656
Created its own Vortec

31
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,216
Sensor Network and what the heck they're doing with that

32
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,288
And what a message from our sponsor digicert

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
All of this

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
Is coming up

35
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
After a

36
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,408
Another one of our response

37
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
A pharaoh

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
Looking for an iot platform

39
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,784
Find out why Kenmore in dealing

40
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,856
The Pharaoh Pharaoh customers have experienced as much as

41
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,392
Is 80% reduction

42
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
And in time to Market

43
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,720
99% pure support

44
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
Antenna

45
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,280
What's higher activation

46
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,376
Plus they can we use 90% of their work from one project to the next

47
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,424
To learn more visit afero

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
That's a fer

49
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
Oh

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,264
Dot IO

51
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
Okay Kevin

52
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Let's get this

53
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
Party started

54
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
Boo boo

55
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
With

56
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
Tracker

57
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
What is happening with tracker

58
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,272
Tracker

59
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,320
You may be familiar with to make

60
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,112
Bluetooth tags for

61
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,696
Locating items you put a tag maybe on purse

62
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,000
Dora backpack or computer whatever

63
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
And

64
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
Ticket believe it behind you can

65
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:16,448
Use crowdsourcing technology from other tracker users to find it but not doing that anymore

66
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
They're still going to support the old tracker

67
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Devices

68
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,152
But they have pivoted with a name change they are now called adaro and they have a new line of products

69
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
Which

70
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,224
Is a Twist on what they used to have so

71
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,832
I kind of find this interesting what Ed Darrow is going to be selling it back they already are

72
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,624
Are a bunch of

73
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,416
Small Bluetooth items

74
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,952
Such as tags

75
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
Tablets

76
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,304
Key Rings lanyards Etc any idea here

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Is that you make a smart

78
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Container

79
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
The container might be again

80
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
A purse a backpack

81
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,984
Duffle bag suitcase whatever might be a briefcase

82
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,056
And you basically use the smaller tags

83
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
Too attached

84
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
To all of the items that you normally

85
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
Carry in that

86
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:01,760
Smart container that back and when you leave the house if you forgotten one of those items

87
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,552
It will notify you before you leave

88
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
Right away

89
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,184
So I like the idea of this it starts at $119

90
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,744
For three tags and three tablets on a charger

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024
So it's not cheap

92
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
But yeah

93
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,096
So I think there's actually

94
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
A gem of a

95
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
Really great

96
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,728
And maybe it's because I'm a parent or maybe it's

97
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
Because I

98
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Personally

99
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
Have

100
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
Crazy lifestyle

101
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,872
But if you could bring something like this in

102
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
And make it washable

103
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,200
And then also make it connect

104
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
To your schedule

105
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,040
I think you start looking at something that

106
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
Really change like that would be worth

107
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
So imagine if

108
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
I could put

109
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,696
Like on my daughter's gym clothes

110
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
These tablets

111
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
And I can dissociate that

112
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Tuesday

113
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Thursday and Friday

114
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,096
Is right

115
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
That kind of stuff

116
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,656
Do you like kimchi

117
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,984
Same thing for me if I could stick it in you know my gym bag

118
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
We're pretending I go to work in this scenario

119
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
I don't but

120
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
I could do that in

121
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
Especially for things that are

122
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
Variable is that the way to think about it

123
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
I don't know

124
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
Like I like where the

125
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:10,368
This is going I don't think it's 100% there yet I mean I know people who do forget their sunglasses their keys and their

126
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,904
Smartphone in their wallet

127
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
Very common

128
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,863
Is here but you walk out the door typically with the same X number of items and every once in a while you forget one of those in this week

129
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,167
Prevent that they do actually have a way to set up

130
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
Customize

131
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
Recurring reminders

132
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,055
So if you have like an event at 5 that normally go to and bring

133
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
Certain things you tag them

134
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,407
It'll remind you hey your yoga classes coming up

135
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,223
Your yoga mat is not in your bag right now don't forget it

136
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
Etcetera etcetera so

137
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
Ender portal

138
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
They're part of the way there

139
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,367
Awesome and this is part of a trend I mean

140
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
In tracker actually that was

141
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Does your

142
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,511
Favorite one out of all the Trap like there's tiles there's a

143
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,327
Oh there's one that starts with a c and I can never remember it

144
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
There's a bunch of these out there but you liked

145
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
The tracker

146
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,191
Yeah we still have them and literally I just

147
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:01,567
Use one right now can I have two more sitting around we have it on the mailbox key

148
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,919
Because we have a mailbox down the street or after I go to it soon a townhouse community

149
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,503
And whoever gets the mail usually wasn't putting the key back where

150
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,855
Didn't we go so nobody could find at the next day so we put that on there so that we could find it

151
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,391
And I think

152
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,183
Where can I see a lot more of this

153
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
Tile even his

154
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
Diantha sized

155
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,351
Individual tiles and is working much more on basically creating a Bluetooth

156
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Tracking Network

157
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
Work through

158
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,191
Is Partnerships with like Land Rover in

159
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,495
Steripen companies and other things

160
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
So

161
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
But I am kind of

162
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
It makes them

163
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,687
It makes sense I mean to smarten up non smart object so that way you know you don't live in behind

164
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,271
I like that idea I don't know if I like it enough $420 minimum purchase

165
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Will get there

166
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
That's the earliest

167
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
We're very familiar with

168
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,695
We pay that all the time make it down this case

169
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Spell usually

170
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
Alright in other news

171
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
This is a little bit more

172
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
How Deeply Tech

173
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,351
Arm has dropped its

174
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
Cordial Bluetooth

175
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,495
An arm is the chip design firm it is the brains of almost every

176
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Smartphone out there

177
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,823
And has a big iot

178
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Division

179
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,199
They'd actually created this IP around Bluetooth and narrowband cellular network

180
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Technology

181
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,039
To help you it was extra low power it

182
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
It was going to be the

183
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
Special

184
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
Highly optimized

185
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
Arlo power was very cool

186
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,183
They basically a banded it

187
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
And

188
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
My hunch is they abandoned it because

189
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Cuz

190
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
It was

191
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
Untested

192
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
There's plenty of other

193
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
Bluetooth face stuff

194
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
Barely low power

195
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
And I imagine that

196
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,495
The buyers of the stuff for like

197
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,799
Do we want to go with something untested not so much

198
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
So

199
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
This kind of sad

200
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:44,223
Because I thought it was actually a really interesting technical solution but sometimes really interesting

201
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
Tactical Solutions if you don't solve

202
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,063
Play huge enough problem in a big enough way

203
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
It's not worth it

204
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
So my hunch is that what

205
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:57,279
It's interesting just run a business perspective they actually made for Acquisitions in the last 3 years to help develop

206
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Concordia prom

207
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
Yeah they did

208
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
And they had funded some of these

209
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,399
Self sow

210
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
Philadelphia punch

211
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Sound

212
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
All right here is

213
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
I guess here's a question

214
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,895
Get some feedback from one of our listeners

215
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
When we talked about

216
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
We answered a question about

217
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
The guy who has a

218
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
His two daughters in their condo

219
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
What should there

220
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
Our first home basically have in it from a connector

221
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
Until are connected devices

222
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,511
And somebody was like Stacy and Kevin you guys really missed the mark by Knotts

223
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
Suggesting some sort of

224
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Security box

225
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,351
So this could be like

226
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
Tattoo Joe service maybe it's

227
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
Weather Network

228
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
For the network

229
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,775
And you know we had an Advertiser bitdefender there like I heard about it

230
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
Just like the bitdefender Box

231
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
It came on right after

232
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,663
I got to think about this and I'm like

233
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
I don't

234
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Currently have

235
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
One of those Services I'll be honest

236
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
But I don't actually run one on my

237
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
What time and I don't

238
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
Feel

239
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Unprotect

240
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
But I do feel like

241
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,951
There is more information that I

242
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,231
I could know about my network

243
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
So I guess you're taking

244
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,375
Well I don't have one either right now I have a Google WiFi mesh Network

245
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,215
Connected directly to Verizon FiOS which is available in my area so that's

246
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
Pretty much it

247
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
You know it

248
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,591
Set up appropriately I don't think there's any more I can do in the Google app

249
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,431
To add security I have look at some VPN services

250
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,735
And try them but that causes problems because

251
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
We subscribe to

252
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
Online television and

253
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
You start having no

254
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
Geolocation issues

255
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
When you have a VPN so

256
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
I turn VPN off

257
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,511
I know there are some boxers that can

258
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:37,887
Not sniff the traffic what sort of monitor the traffic and see if devices are inappropriately

259
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,239
Accessing the web and so on and those have to go behind my Wi-Fi

260
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Networking

261
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,823
So that seems to be an issue as well cuz

262
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,223
I don't want anything behind the network is that causes other set of problems so I think it's a good idea I have yet to have found the right

263
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
One for me and

264
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
I prefer without a

265
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,647
Subscription I'm a look at some that I can install on Raspberry Pi

266
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,463
Pihole that project on fenkell I really block

267
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
Herbs and things

268
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,047
Give me any security so I'm all for it

269
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
I just haven't found the right one

270
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Fair

271
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
Yeah and so I guess

272
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,959
We will amend our answer to say

273
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,751
If you're really concerned about this

274
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
There are security services and box

275
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,359
Does that come I actually do check

276
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,431
My Eero Network every now and then to see if any devices are

277
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
Like sending more data than they should

278
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
But that's about the extent

279
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Extent of it

280
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
So I'm not really

281
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,439
I do the same in in the Google Wi-Fi app you can see it anytime the history or real-time what devices are on that

282
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
Network that IP use the Mac addresses

283
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:40,863
How much traffic they sent over time Etc an indication like if my

284
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
I don't know if

285
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
If your doorbell start

286
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
Sending like 30 GB

287
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
The traffic a day you're going to be like

288
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,775
Different video

289
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:54,175
Does heat up a bunch of maybe I should look at that closer cuz I typically is one of the higher used devices but like my June oven is using

290
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
30 gig

291
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Then I'm like

292
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
That should not be

293
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,831
If your doorbell is using 30 gig I want to know how many

294
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
Coming up to your door

295
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:06,463
Take Norm for a lot of walks couple times a day in and out in and out

296
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
Norm's life is good

297
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
Okay

298
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,071
So we'll leave it up to you to decide on that way

299
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
When I'm not sold

300
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
If you are

301
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
Super concerned or if I noticed

302
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
Ad networks slow down

303
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
I would probably

304
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,031
Splurge and get one just to see what's going on

305
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
But I'm not sure if it needs

306
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
To be there just yet

307
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
But maybe I'm wrong because according to

308
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Nokia

309
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,479
Excellent Segway

310
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,039
According to Nokia iot Bots

311
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:35,903
In 5 minutes now make up 16% of infected devices

312
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Observe

313
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
On

314
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,231
Just general Network

315
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
In the world

316
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
So this is up significantly

317
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
According to them from

318
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
3.5% of 2

319
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
This is there

320
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Malware

321
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Report that they put out the

322
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
And basically

323
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,775
The big story here is

324
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
Holy cow

325
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
Iot

326
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,151
Art infected iot devices are now huge

327
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Horsham

328
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,503
Iot bot activity represented

329
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
At 78%

330
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
Networkx

331
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
That they have seen in carrier Network

332
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
That's more than double the rate

333
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,487
In 2016 after the big Turning Point

334
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Mirai

335
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
So

336
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,631
And to put it in perspective for additional perspective Nokia breaks out

337
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
Different device types

338
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
Classes of devices

339
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
An Android is

340
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
Basically the biggest Target right now they say

341
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,919
Leaving notice a Android device is responsible for about 47.15% of observed

342
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Maillard effect

343
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,759
Windows has 35% so right there you got

344
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:38,111
At seventy 82% of those two device classes IRT and then

345
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,951
The iPhone is like less than 1% cyattie basically the other bit here

346
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:47,583
I think that's going to change if you think it was jumping from one year ago to now give it one or two more years

347
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
When

348
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,167
There are billions more iot devices out there

349
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,495
And what do the bats go after the Big Easy targets

350
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
And that's what iot is becoming

351
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:02,431
Well I think it's worth noting that these iot devices are basically anything that's not a smartphone or

352
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,479
Computer and one of the challenges

353
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
Is there is

354
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,063
There a lot of iot devices out there that

355
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,855
We don't necessarily think of as I am

356
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
They might be

357
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
Printers

358
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,951
Or networked DVRs

359
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
So while this is a real

360
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Rhett

361
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:22,911
Probably less of a threat for something like your thermostat one because it doesn't have a lot of processing power

362
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,239
Into because I'm good company is going to

363
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,823
Handle things like API limit calls so it's not going to reach out

364
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Try to talk to

365
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
To offer

366
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
So that's just something

367
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
Nothing about if

368
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
You're going to pick a device that scary

369
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,063
I would look to video doorbells video cameras that are connected

370
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,879
And I would really make sure when you're buying those devices

371
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
Buy them from reputa

372
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
All right

373
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
As many of you guys know I'm planning on moving

374
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,095
And well it's still like 6 months away but you know it

375
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,143
I'm still thinking about all of my devices

376
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,727
And you can expect to hear more about this but I love the fact

377
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
Property Brothers

378
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
Those guys on

379
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,335
I don't know is it Bravo what channel is

380
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
What channel are they on

381
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
HGTV

382
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
Oh

383
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
Yeah that makes

384
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
So those guys

385
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,063
They actually did a panel where they talked about Smart Homes and

386
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
Selling your smartphone

387
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
I'm so of course I read it

388
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,671
And didn't tell me anything new

389
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
But

390
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
They did say that

391
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,511
Look when you have all the

392
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
Play smart devices they become

393
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
A feature

394
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,399
If possible selling point your home so don't take them out leave them in there

395
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
So things like your nest thermostat

396
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,007
Or your video doorbells or even light switches

397
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
He says they can

398
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
Raise your home's value

399
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
Yeah I could see that man

400
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,663
It is an investment as they say number one in

401
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,015
It's a value to the new buyers potential I mean not everybody wants a smart home but

402
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
Becoming very prevalent

403
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,135
The thing is little and I kind of realized this when I moved 2 years ago

404
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
If you're going to leave everything

405
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:54,303
You still have to actually factory reset everything and leave instructions for people have said all this

406
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Stuff up

407
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
That was going to be my play

408
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
Holy cow

409
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
I'm in the process

410
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
Figuring out what I will leave

411
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
And I realized that some of my device

412
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,823
Is our Echo only

413
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,663
For example and so nice person comes in with a Google they're going to be like

414
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
I don't need this

415
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
Which is fine

416
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
They don't have to have it

417
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,319
Are they don't have to use it but like my echo powered faucet

418
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
And the other thing is

419
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
When you're showing off

420
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Off the house

421
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,695
And you mention these things

422
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
The stuff better work

423
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,279
In I don't know about you but sometimes I will

424
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
Hotel

425
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,119
Padme to do something you were even Google to do something

426
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
And

427
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Nothing happens

428
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Maybe they didn't hear me

429
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
Right or my favorite is like

430
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
Wind

431
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
I say something in

432
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,335
Madam a thinks I said something else and provides me with

433
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
Completely different answer

434
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
It does but if you're trying to sell someone on the

435
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,991
Mustafa it's a little less ideal

436
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
Agreed

437
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:51,135
So I guess that's all I have to say about that you guys will hear more and I will definitely do a definitive guide to

438
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,439
I guess my particular smart home and

439
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
Decommissioning it

440
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,023
But in the meantime Kevin and I want to talk to you about

441
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,327
Tech Meme and the tech meme ride home podcast

442
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,655
So Kevin and I follow technium.com

443
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
Years since it started

444
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
Basically yes

445
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
As journalist is

446
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031

447
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
Up-to-date on

00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
Daily News and

449
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
They now have a daily

450
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
It comes out every weekday at 5 p.m.

451
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
We find it super helpful

452
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:21,087
It's like 15 to 20 minutes long and it really gets you

453
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,159
You could see the scoop on whatever happened that day in the news

454
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
So

455
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,487
Cuz you guys probably like podcast

463
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
About us

464
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,663

Not that way Kevin

466
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,783
Okay so let's go into some

467
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
Quick news Rundown

468
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
Thoughts on new devices

469
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
Okay

470
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Over across

471
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
The pond

472
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,231
Free which is a very innovative

473
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
Telecom in is

474
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
SP they've created a

475
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,839
New device a new consumer premises

476
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,631
Device called the free box Delta

477
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
It is worth noting that

478
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
S1 because

479
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,495
I started covering

480
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Isps in

481
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,543
Broadband

482
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Free was just

483
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
Innovative as all get-out

484
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Just super crazy

485
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
They're still doing it so now they have this

486
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
If you sign up for their

487
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
Service you get

488
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
What they called the free box Delta

489
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
It acts as a zigbee hub

490
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,135
Is Scott Madam a built-in

491
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
It's got a really fancy

492
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
And it's got six

493
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
Cox connectivity

494
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,559
Which is a proprietary low-power Network for things like

495
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,351
Old smoke detectors in

496
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Random

497
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Sensors

498
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
Need long battery

499
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
So they're putting that out there

500
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
It's also a media player a 4K

501
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
HDR multimedia box

502
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
And

503
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
I'm kind of excited

504
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
It's a fancy thing

505
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
What doesn't it at

506
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
It doesn't have Z-Wave

507
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
Oh okay alright

508
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
I mean it's like everything in the kitchen sink there

509
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,855
Yes it really does so

510
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
It's pretty fancy

511
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
They're going to charge you

512
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
10 euros a month

513
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
For this

514
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Device

515
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
After 4 years

516
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
The pain that you

517
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
Can keep it forever

518
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
And

519
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
The CEO of

520
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
A free he hinted

521
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,703
Selling Reebok steel toe.

522
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
Consumers in other countries

523
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Even if they can't see

524
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Subscribe to the eyes

525
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
So I don't know

526
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,103
It's kind of like

527
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,895
Roku * a million I don't know

528
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:27,039
Yeah it's I mean I have the Nvidia Shield Android TV which could be a

529
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,855
SmartThings Hub as well there's a USB stick to add

530
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
Zigbee and Z-Wave

531
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,183
And that's kind of a similar all in one box

532
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
There's no

533
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:38,047
Subscriptions paid but the Box itself is typically $180 is not

534
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:42,655
Are they cheaper set-top boxes out there but he's one of those it's got a whole bunch of everything in it

535
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
A whole bunch of

536
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
You alright

537
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,031
Move on down smart accessory maker idevices

538
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Yes

539
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
I don't have any idevice

540
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,383
Devices but

541
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,199
For those that do they are now integrated with

542
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
If

543
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:02,367
So you can use if this then that to create recipes for your idevices all I devices are

544
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
Supported except

545
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,463
For the idevices thermostat and there

546
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
Customizable LED night light

547
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,607
Other than that any connected smart home idevice product you can

548
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
Work with f

549
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
Another i-news iHome has launched

550
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
Vanity mirror and alarm clock

551
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
I

552
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,615
Yeah let's just go with music and movement

553
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:30,015
I know Evans gets into what I said A week or two ago and I was saying it's just at some point it's going to

554
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:36,415
Stop making sense of microphones and speakers and every single thing like I don't see why you need it in a vanity mirror quite honestly

555
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,463
This is why I want to know this my little robot

556
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
Follow me around or whatever listen

557
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,047
Is my assistant but

558
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
Madam

559
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,911
Who is the fairest of them all

560
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,751
Yeah well for $180 I will not do that for this spending year

561
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
That's how much it is

562
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
That is how much

563
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Also

564
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,615
Other crazy new products

565
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Bose

566
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,943
Has created gosh it's another glasses out the

567
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
It is a new wearable it is

568
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
These are sunglasses

569
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
And I don't even know

570
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,927
What's it look like normal sunglass actually look like snaps

571
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
Spectacles

572
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,999
With just a sunglass of the minutes

573
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,303
They're $199 you can pre-order them

574
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,375
There's some AR apps actually coming next year so they're not just

575
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
Smart glasses

576
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,959
Speakers

577
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,007
Yep there speakers

578
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
Is there microphones

579
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
AR

580
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,919
And yeah and you can access your virtual assistant

581
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,247
I mean it's kind of like her except it's sunglasses not that your thing

582
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
Yeah

583
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,647
I don't have the nice thing is you won't hear or people around you won't hear the assistant

584
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,951
Through the speakers because they're kind of

585
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,535
Patched into the arm of the glasses or no earbuds or anything

586
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,607
So I don't think of using like bone-conduction Witchwood

587
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,911
Give me a little more privacy as well but they say that

588
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
It's pretty discreet

589
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
And they will run up to

590
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
3.5 hours

591
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
4

592
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,055
Playback of music

593
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,335
And 12 hours on Steam

594
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
So you don't end up considering their sunglasses

595
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
I think it's a little weird

596
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
Just because

597
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
I mean like

598
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
You're inside

599
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,295
I don't know I mean I get it

600
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
You're outside you're away from

601
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,367
I'm stuffed but are you even connect

602
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:17,535
You probably going to Bluetooth to the phone because there's no assistant built-in so to speak it's going to leverage in assistant on your

603
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:22,399
Your phone so I'm very can I have prescription sunglasses so I'm not the market

604
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,959
Get there going to be $200 pre-order start today

605
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,495
They're not going to be out for a while

606
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,799
Let us know if you buy this I'm really intrigued

607
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,359
I think it's neat and I'm like oh I can't wait

608
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
So they work as a Bluetooth

609
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,687
Headset for phone calls as well

610
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,247
You can take calls make calls I mean I don't

611
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,319
I'm not in the market for this and I think we've kind of

612
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,135
A kind of gotten over the whole smartglasses thing

613
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
But maybe

614
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,439
Sure I mean

615
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,231
Let's give it a throw it out there soon

616
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
Ikea

617
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
Has announced a in addition to its

618
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
Triad

619
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
Line of products

620
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
It is a $10 smart plug

621
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
To go with it

622
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
Lights

623
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
There's nothing much

624
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
To say about that

625
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
Arlo has

626
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
Updated

627
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,895
Wireless security camera now it has the Arlo Ultra

628
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,735
It is a 4K HDR wireless security camera it has a built

629
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
10 spotlight

630
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
And

631
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319
It's $400

632
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,159
Well 4K doesn't come cheap got to pay for all those case

633
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
I just

634
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,792
I don't know if we'll get there with 4k on all these devices over time in the prices will come down

635
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,632
So somebody had to be out of the gate cuz I don't think any other security cameras right now

636
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
R4k

637
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
Do you need that

638
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,984
Definition will

639
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,384
Are you know if you have cameras outside for example maybe something happen to your car like mine did with the nest cam

640
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,224
I could tell that a car hit it I could see my car move when it got hit

641
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
It was hard for me to exactly determine the type of vehicle and I certainly can see their license plate because zooming in

642
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,184
A 1080p didn't cut it so

643
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,232
If you can get four times the pixels

644
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,560
Then maybe there are use cases where yeah zooming is going to be useful

645
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,888
I'm not saying it's worth it I'm just saying

646
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
Hey

647
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
Speaking of nest

648
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,104
Did your camera go down again I did not get any notifications that my Nest cameras went down but apparently a bunch of

649
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
People did

650
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
Last week

651
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,176
I think it was

652
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,272
The overseer was just a couple days ago my bad on December 3rd

653
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:20,928
Nest went down again Booth third time in less than a month this happened on the 15th of November 27th of November

654
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:26,048
And on December 3rd and no root cause has been identified but it has been

655
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Obviously

656
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,608
Where everybody would know about it

657
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,632
What's going on

658
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,704
With a cloud services on Google Cloud

659
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
I don't know

660
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,264
But if anyone has any clues

661
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Let us know

662
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:40,128
In the meantime I do appreciate that whatever my Nest devices go offline or have trouble

663
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
I do actually get an email notice

664
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
Application that's like by the way

665
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
We're not working

666
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
So you know that's

667
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,552
Kind of a bare minimum but it is nice

668
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
Not all of my device

669
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
Isis do that

670
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:55,232
And actually I should give a shout out to downdetector.com because that is at one place too

671
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,816
Search for any services that are disruptive and actually right now

672
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,376
On the east and west coast sewer are some

673
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
Issues with nest

674
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
I don't think it's

675
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
Ton

676
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,752
But I see the map and it's got some yellow and orange

677
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
Dots on it

678
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
No

679
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,616
Let's see we have

680
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,640
Are lenovo's

681
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,920
We have to

682
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,456
Each of us has a Lenovo smart.

683
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Play whe

684
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
They have new features

685
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
Too and I do

686
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,160
New features in fact they are getting cooking features

687
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Such as

688
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,768
Your cookbook and how save and retrieve recipes you can make save

689
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,840
Certain recipes maybe that you use on a regular basis

690
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:35,168
They have the nest hello doorbell two-way talk

691
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
Which

692
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
I have on my

693
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:41,312
Pixel 3 phone so that way it just pops right up the doorbell shows music

694
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,152
All the way downstairs and my display is Right neck

695
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:51,808
So that's going to be and when I tested this on the pixel it was so much faster than having to open the app after getting a note

696
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,904
Vacation and by the time I did that to talk to whoever was on the front porch they already gone

697
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,232
So this is a much better way to do it they have touch alarms in the

698
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:05,632
Quick Settings now the time out to go to a dark screen is actually faster when in low light which is good at night time

699
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:12,288
You can even Now by voice I turn off the screen I don't do that so if these sensor isn't quite working at night to your side of

700
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
Faction you can say hey

701
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Java spring

702
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
And then

703
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:20,480
I really like respect my white loves us the bigger dark screen clock face have you looked at this lately

704
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,784
Yes I noticed that and I was like

705
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,368
You have the update and me with

706
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,904
Terrible eyesight

707
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,768
Even with the smart display on my nightstand right next to my bed I could not read the little clock

708
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
At night so now I can

709
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,352
Well I must read this one my eyes are really bad

710
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
Lee's Summit

711
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Suppose sunglass

712
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,216
Then you can have an AR

713
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,264
Who needs good vision

714
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
Just use AR

715
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,616
Let's talk about your new toy you got a Google home hub

716
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
Yes yeah

717
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:55,296
Speaking of smart displays at the last second while the Google home hub was on sale for $99 direct from Google

718
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
I ordered one

719
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,416
It is so small which I knew because I saw it at the laundromat but I

720
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:05,024
Took it out of the box as soon as it arrives and I send Stacy a picture of this device in the palm of my hand

721
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,816
And what did you think when you saw that

722
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,144
Cute butt

723
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,216
Again with bad eyes I like a larger display on things

724
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:19,616
So we actually because we have a 10 inch smart display in the bedroom I stopped watching TV on that

725
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,200
Facts about TV on the wall there I was using it for you to TV from time to time

726
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
But it's big on a nightstand so we

727
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,064
Suave I bought the home hub for the kitchen island

728
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,368
To watch news in the morning or coffee with my wife

729
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:35,488
But actually the smart display is better the big one the 10-inch one so now the Google home hub is on the nightstand

730
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:39,840
An array it's a good fit there I think that's an ideal size for the bed

731
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:44,192
It does all the same things as well whenever one I just does not have a camera that's fine

732
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
But Duo calls actually work

733
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:51,360
The same I mean I didn't know my son was going to call you about having to be laying around in bed and I got to do a call on me

734
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:57,760
I'm up if you can only do Audiomack I don't care and pick it up so I pick it up I explain to him that I got no camera here he said that's no problem

735
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
He was happy to show me his

736
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:05,696
Happy face so we had a great call the experience was fine yeah I mean I think it's a nice device at specially 99

737
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,488
149 it's a little pricey

738
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
All right and I think

739
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
It's a good bedside tables

740
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,120
I also have a

741
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,936
Talk about I have a review unit of the

742
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,728
First Alert onelink

743
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
Safe and

744
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
Sound

745
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,568
That is a mouthful it's actually device

746
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,616
We recommended on her gift guide

747
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
4

748
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
Play parents

749
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
Just because

750
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,992
So it is expensive it's about $200

751
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
But this is a smoke detector

752
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
A carbon monoxide detector

753
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,112
And

754
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
The crazy part

755
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,184
It's a really good speaker

756
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Bitconnect

757
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,488
To Apple homekit

758
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
And

759
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
Amazon's Echo

760
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
Ecosystem

761
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,096
So I can

762
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
Talk to this

763
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,472
Speaker and I tell it to do something I can talk to it just like I would talk to Madam a

764
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,056
Controls all those devices it also will play my music

765
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
From anime

766
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,384
And it will also make phone

767
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,944
So and it sounds amazing

768
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
The only issue I have

769
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,552
With it is because my smoke detectors and I think most smoke

770
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
Actors are set by the doorways of rooms

771
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
I kind of want this thing in the

772
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
The center of my

773
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
Has one big

774
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,304
It also has a night light that is a multi colored LED that you can

775
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
Can set so I can set it

776
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
I think right now it's set to

777
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,424
So you know in the middle of the night or whatever it is

778
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
Detects a lowlights

779
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,472
Setting it's like

780
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,008
What turn the night light on

781
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,336
Socket has purple glowy light in my hall right now where I'm testing it out

782
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Setting it up with

783
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
Super Breeze

784
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
I have

785
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Kidde smoke

786
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
Detectors

787
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
So

788
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
It's a different brand

789
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,040
They have a comes with three different connectors

790
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
And a mounting bracket

791
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,368
So I unscrewed my mounting bracket

792
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
I took Olive like

793
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
30 seconds

794
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,464
Pop the other mounting bracket

795
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,536
And use the little connector shove the wires up

796
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,840
Screw the sucker on the hardest part

797
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,120
Was actually screwing it

798
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
Into

799
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
Mounting bracket

800
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
Not a hundred percent sure I

801
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
Got all of the things

802
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
I say this be

803
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
Because this is a very heavy

804
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,408
Smoke alarm it weighs like

805
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,456
I don't know pound and a half to pounds

806
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,248
It's not something like

807
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,528
Cuz like I really don't want to

808
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,064
First of all because it is heavy

809
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,088
It's a decent speaker

810
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,368
Indecent speakers

811
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,928
Are heavy weighs 1.76 lb

812
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,208
Oh I was good but

813
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
Check Outback

814
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
Yes that was a good guess

815
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,048
And it does have like I said

816
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:22,400
The homekit compatibility sew-in is going to have AirPlay 2 coming later on

817
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,936
So you can actually

818
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,472
Play your Apple music

819
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,008
Through it if you set it up as

820
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,544
Homekit function

821
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
Functionality

822
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
I didn't do that because

823
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,200
Didn't need to but you know if you wanted to

824
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,248
You could actually set it up as a homekit devices

825
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
Control it from there

826
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
I tested it it works

827
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,904
As a traditional smoke alarm so it will go off

828
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,720
And will also set off all of your other smoke alarms

829
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
If they're inert

830
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:51,584
Does it send you an alert on your

831
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120
On your body

832
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
Thing says you are hallways

In case you're not at home

834
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,032
Yes cuz currently none of my

835
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,616
Alarms do that but none of your dumb smoke alarms cost

836
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,664
$250

837
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,456

Which device and for most people you're probably just going to be like

846
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
Why don't I just buy an echo Dot

And I would say to you this sounds better

848
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
But

849
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752

850
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,384

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
True true

856

857
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,440
Yeah well the heaviness suggest that to

858
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,280
Not yet I have your speaker typically would sound better not

859
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,840

926
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,064
We looked and we didn't find anything

927
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
There was a product that you sweet made

928
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,624
That would work for that

929
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
But

930
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,928
We came up empty so

931
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,768
At least you're not empty-headed David you you win the Schlage Smart Lock

932
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
Yay

933
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,096
All right and I should note that last week

934
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,632
We talked about

935
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,912
Putting in a smart

936
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,216
Light switch without a neutral wire I said that

937
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,032
The only option out there was Lutron

938
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
And a bunch of people who use insteon

939
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,360
We're like jalapeno

940
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,384
That is not true

941
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,712
Is insteon actually makes a light switch that also works

942
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
Out

943
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
A neutral wire

944
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
You will need

945
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
In NC

946
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,136
However you also need a Lutron Hub so you know

947
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
Similar

948
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
And now

949
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,744
Let's go to this week

950
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
Question

951
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Which is from

952
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Clarissa

953
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,096
Hi guys this is

954
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,400
I have

955
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,192
Question about

956
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
Smart Talk

957
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,520
If you guys

958
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,568
We're not concerned about privacy and anyway

959
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,176
My tech would you be using in your bed

960
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
Thanks have a great one

961
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,504
Okay Clarissa

962
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,296
This is a good question

963
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,832
And when we can totally help with

964
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
So

965
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Clarissa

966
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
Let us explain it

967
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:07,072
We actually probably have more devices to suggest than one would want in their bedroom and working

968
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,632
Keeping in mind that maybe privacy doesn't matter enough

969
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,424
That's fine that's a personal choice

970
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,216
Some useful items we have in here

971
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,288
So we mentioned the smartest plays earlier in the show

972
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,336
I definitely think that's a good

973
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,408
Place for a smart displays in the bedroom is Stacy and said

974
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:25,504
Because you have voice control of all of your smart home devices you can also

975
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,808
Touch screen control them if maybe

976
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,856
Somebody sleeping in the room you don't want to use a voice

977
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,648
You can get weather information York

978
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
Calendar

979
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
You can do

980
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
Cameras from other devices in your home

981
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,512
Really handy

982
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:40,096
You probably want some smart followers and or switches

983
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
We could

984
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,936
Decide on any single one there's so many options out there

985
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,728
So did want to make a plug

986
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
4

987
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:51,616
There a couple lights like Philips and GE make lights that are designed for better

988
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,176
Sleeping better

989
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
Throughout circadian rhythm

990
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,296
Circuit anyway

991
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
Start out with bright daylight

992
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,440
And then evolve slowly into a deeper orange as it gets towards sleepy

993
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:09,280
And when you wake up you can have those kind of come up like Sunrise which

994
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
Kind of nice

995
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,352
And then we also have

996
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,680
Amazon look with Stacy you

997
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
This is

998
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,544
Kind of interesting because you can use it to help get

999
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
Clothes selection

1000
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:26,176
Yes it is a camera where you basically put on an outfit

1001
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:26,944
Take a picture

1002
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
Using the web camera

1003
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
Snap a picture

1004
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
And it snaps a picture

1005
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
And then you

1006
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,576
Put on

1007
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
Other outfit options

1008
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,952
What's it basically looks at those and says

1009
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,976
This one's better

1010
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,000
So

1011
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,328
This is a really kind of silly thing but I threw it in there just in case

1012
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
You

1013
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
Have doubts about your

1014
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,168
Watch over need a friend

1015
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:53,824
If my wife ever divorce has met with her fashion degree and go somewhere else I will get one of those because

1016
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,360
She dresses me basically

1017
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
Photo app that doesn't happen

1018
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
Let's hope

1019
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:04,064
I'm always thinking ahead I want to be prepared you know you know

1020
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,464
If you want to monitor your sleep you could obviously do that through wearable devices there's so many of those that do track

1021
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,024
Sleep such as the fitbits and smart watches and such

1022
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
Why things actually makes

1023
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
A nice

1024
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,632
Relatively inexpensive

1025
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
Solution for this

1026
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:22,752
You basically put a little pad under your mattress and it

1027
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,056
Tracks your sleep sleep stages heart rate

1028
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
Snoring the whole shebang

1029
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,896
And you can get that for about

1030
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:35,296
$80 on sale list price as a hundred bucks which is not too expensive as a nice smartphone app as well so you can look at the graphs

1031
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Send all the data

1032
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,160
If that's your thing and then we also came up with

1033
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,696
Monitoring your air

1034
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
In your bedroom

1035
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:48,352
Because you want to be sleeping in clean air if they see you mentioned this before because you bought one

1036
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,376
To monitor the

1037
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
Classroom are

1038
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,936
For your daughter's class

1039
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:57,056
And it's the aware glow which is kind of like a smart plug but also with sensors to monitor

1040
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,104
Different aspects of the air quality

1041
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
Yes it

1042
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
Temperature humidity

1043
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
The

1044
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
Carbon dioxide

1045
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,272
Oxide in the air and also

1046
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
Quote on quote

1047
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
Chemicals

1048
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
Which are

1049
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
Volatile or

1050
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,488
And I didn't know until you mentioned it before the show that

1051
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,024
You can actually use that

1052
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
Data

1053
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:22,400
And have the arrears plug actually turn on say humidifier this Plug-In or a

1054
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,216
Air purifier or a heater or air conditioner

1055
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,824
Yes you will tell be aware what you plugged into it basically

1056
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,384
So if he's plug-in in our case we plug it in

1057
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
Air purifier

1058
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
When it sees

1059
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,272
That the air quality is degrading it will actually

1060
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,808
Proactively turn on the air

1061
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344
Which is

1062
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,880
Cool feature I think

1063
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:48,512
So you just tell it what your plug again and then I will use it to proactively adapt Fiero

1064
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Around you

1065
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
And I think that's

1066
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
Awesome picture

1067
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,472
And since we have an air purifier that nobody wants to get out of bed to flip the switch I am going to go by myself in a where

1068
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
Glow because

1069
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,032
That is perfect for what we need

1070
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:06,432
Last thing we could suggest that this is really going to town if you don't care about privacy we talked about it before the 1400

1071
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,480
Dollar 3D body

1072
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,784
Scanner mirror from naked Labs yes

1073
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,392
The naked so you could see how fit you are or not

1074
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,952
Well I didn't want to say that but yes

1075
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,976
Yes because

1076
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:23,328
Gretchen you probably wouldn't have that in your bedroom that might be in a bathroom connected to the bedroom but

1077
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,144
I think it's really interesting product I just don't think it's

1078
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,192
First $1,400 when I can

1079
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,520
You take pictures or have my family just told me I'm getting fat but that's just me

1080
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
I think it's

1081
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
Venus Project

1082
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,360
And I would not want it at all in my life

1083
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:38,176
I don't even like that it exists in the world but

1084
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:41,504
Close because of privacy or because you have

1085
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,552
Because I don't want to know

1086
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,344
Okay

1087
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,624
I can do something else

1088
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,904
Without the aid

1089
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
An artificial

1090
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,048
You can pay me $10 a week

1091
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,096
For you as well.

1092
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,888
Cuz I like you I think you're my friend

1093
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:02,752
So I am biased yes I would not want that information from you cuz at the end of it I be like

1094
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,032
Screw you Kevin

1095
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,568
So much for that Revenue stream

1096
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,360
All right

1097
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:11,968
So hopefully out of all of these devices oh and I will throw this in

1098
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,272
We talked about having a connected bedside table lamp

1099
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,856
Which I think is great but also why not connect your bedroom light switch

1100
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,392
Because then if

1101
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
Those lights have

1102
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,184
And Beyond

1103
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,000
You can turn them off with your voice without getting out of bed witch

1104
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,560
What time snug under my covers I do not

1105
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
Want to leave that room so

1106
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,888
I would throw that in there and maybe a smart outlet

1107
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,960
Letter to to control fans or anything else you got going on

1108

In the bedroom

1109
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,520
So all of those

1110
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,800
Really

1111
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,824
Actually have most of

1112
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,432
And I thought you cared about privacy and I do care about

1113
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:48,832
Privacy I don't have any cameras in the bedroom that's the only thing I don't have the look is in my closet facing away unless I need

1114
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,880
Facebook portal

1115
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:51,904
Nope

1116
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
All right

1117
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,440
Well

1118
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:58,304
That is it for this segment of the show please stay tuned for a message from our sponsor

1119
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,608
And our interview with

1120
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
Cit

1121
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,424
CEO of the City of Calgary

1122
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,984
Talking about their laurel-ann

1123
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,008
Sensor Network

1124
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:14,176
Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor sponsor is

1125
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:18,528
Digicert and I have Mike Nelson who is VP of iot security

1126
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
Here to talk to

1127
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,136
Let's get this started by telling us a little bit about what digicert

1128
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,952
Where certificate Authority or the largest certificate

1129
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,512
30 globally in our services are

1130
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,792
Protecting internet connection

1131
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,608
And that raises everything from SSL TLS

1132
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,704
Certificate for website security to Enterprise Security Solutions and

1133
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,728
My area ZIP code

1134
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
Courses with iot

1135
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,592
Security and we have robust Solutions using visual search

1136
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,384
Give the kids to secure it authentication

1137
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,432
Communication over the internet

1138
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,712
Excellent all right

1139
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,016
Well you guys recently did a survey

1140
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,040
About coyotes

1141
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
What did you guys discuss

1142
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,136
Yeah earlier this year was selected

1143
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:59,488
A survey we reached out to over 700 engineer's for iot

1144
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,512
Manufacturers

1145
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,328
These were people on the front lines

1146
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,608
Security in their organization

1147
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,144
Other respondents

1148
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
Divided them into

1149
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
Three tier

1150
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,472
The top tier

1151
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,264
Would be classified as organizations

1152
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,056
Sunset have fewer iotc

1153
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,104
Security incidents they've demonstrated

1154
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
Mura Masa

1155
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:20,480
Tree and iot security doing things like encryption authentication risk

1156
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,528
Assessments there's middle class

1157
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,064
The bottom

1158
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,600
The bottom tier of Courts

1159
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,416
For the organizations that are really struggling to get

1160
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
How old am I

1161
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,000
Security and to put those practices in place

1162
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,560
So we're there big differences between the two

1163
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,864
The results were surprising

1164
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
So we have to respond

1165
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,216
About iot related security incidents that they had a

1166
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
Experience

1167
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
The past 2 years

1168
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,568
The difference between the top and the bottom

1169
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,848
Here were a mistake

1170
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,408
Of the bottom tier organizations

1171
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
Every one of them

1172
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,224
Reported that

1173
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Experienced

1174
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,272
The security incident

1175
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,088
Something like monetary damages or loss of product

1176
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
70 compared to just

1177
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,440
32% of the top-tier organizations

1178
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,232
Experiencing an incident

1179
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,536
Comedian shows that

1180
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:09,632
The things the Topsy organizations are doing those things like encryption and I'll send it

1181
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
Vacation

1182
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
Risk assessment other devices

1183
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,240
Those things are working

1184
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,568
And they're leaving those organizations to be much better off

1185
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
Okay

1186
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,384
So let's talk about those on the bottom tier

1187
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,176
What type of damages

1188
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
Did they

1189
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,480
Yeah I think

1190
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,272
Most surprising was monetary.

1191
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,552
25 /

1192
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,112
Percent of the bottom tier reported iotc

1193
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:30,880
Security lock

1194
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,952
At least 34 million dollars in the last

1195
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
2 years

1196
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,768
And those range from

1197
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,304
Monetary damages

1198
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,072
Loss of Prada

1199
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
Activity

1200
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,632
Legal penalties that they're having

1201
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,192
Pay and impact to their stock price

1202
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,520
So where can we find out more about digicert and the results of

1203
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:51,360
Our website is www.denniskirk.com

1204
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,895
And there's a link there that

1205
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,199
And take you to find more information about the survey

1206
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:10,047
Everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Heather

1207
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
Read Penske

1208
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:15,167
Who is the CI to at the city of

1209
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,727
Alder tree

1210
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:22,335
I'm just Gray Station thanks awesome. I should tell u c i t o mean

1211
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:26,431
Chief Information Technology officer which is a title I've never heard

1212
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
Is that really common

1213
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,271
I guess in Calgary or in this Municipal business

1214
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,295
No I think it was

1215
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,319
Just a combination

1216
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,135
Heo so it

1217
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:40,767
Takes a basketball to put them together or possibly just two jobs in one day

1218
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:44,863
So the City of Calgary has deployed a Laura

1219
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,679
Network and I thought this was really interesting because

1220
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:50,751
One there not alot of city-owned Laura Networks

1221
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,335
But I'm aware of so I want to talk about that and then you guys are doing some really cool

1222
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
Cool things with it

1223
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,151
So let's just start off with

1224
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,199
Your approach to this networking

1225
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
How this came to be

1226
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,527
Sure and I have to go back in

1227
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,551
In time because

1228
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,855
And City of Calgary we've always had a vision

1229
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,879
Turn around connected

1230
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,671
City and. Started

1231
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
You know more than

1232
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,767
15 years ago and we've been building out communication

1233
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,071
Structure to a fiber optic Network

1234
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,863
18 years

1235
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,911
We really saw that is the foundation

1236
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,215
Send up Dan building a pond that

1237
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Forest Park

1238
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,031
Obsidian to the Future

1239
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,079
And innocent of knowing what was

1240
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:26,847
Coming into

1241
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,383
Future in terms of

1242
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,687
Depot access devices building

1243
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,967
Being connected

1244
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735
What that would

1245
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,527
Mean for a city operation

1246
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
Versailles

1247
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,599
We wanted to make sure we had that Foundation

1248
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,135
Spice so

1249
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,439
We have used a fiber-optic Network

1250
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
4

1251
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,023
Carrier-grade Network which we built

1252
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:45,791
In

1253
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,583
Nickelback 2013

1254
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,935
Which shirts all of our trip a product Network for the City of Calgary and all our offer

1255
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,983
911

1256
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
311

1257
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,287
Water skiing

1258
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,359
And then from there we you

1259
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,895
Use some of the infrastructure that we had

1260
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,175
Play so we have

1261
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,199
Radio towers

1262
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:03,967
That we use

1263
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,271
Responders for their Radio City

1264
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,623
And wisdom tooth at Biltmore the last mile

1265
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,695
Components of a fixed Wireless which helped us to get to a few

1266
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,719
UCI

1267
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,583
And then from there we challenged our innovation

1268
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
Technology

1269
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,215
To go about researching

1270
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,847
Spell to do that

1271
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
Awesome

1272
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,919
It sounds like there's lots of things going over that Network

1273
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,479
We can run many different services on it it's

1274
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,807
260 City facilities

1275
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
City operator

1276
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,671
Is really important in our a lot

1277
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:50,559
Has been that is a city we need our own private Network we be everywhere we

1278
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,143
Sure we need it to be available for our first

1279
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:54,911
Responders

1280
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,959
MCC Public Safety situation

1281
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,495
And that's always been

1282
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,263
Our

1283
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,287
Call Envision

1284
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,591
So why did you choose Laura

1285
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,431
When they're kind of some other proprietary Technologies out there there's the

1286
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,759
The cellular stuff was it part of the being city-owned aspect

1287
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:13,343
No it was just our team really analyzed

1288
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,367
They reviewed

1289
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,415
Lora technology and

1290
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,207
It really felt it had some of

1291
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,231
Advantages

1292
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,583
Security functionality the implementation and operating cost

1293
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,655
The real ability to have

1294
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,679
True that coverage

1295
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,703
Performance

1296
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,263
And

1297
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
Knology

1298
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,335
One picture they have flexibility and better

1299
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,639
The system that was

1300
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,407
The technology

1301
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,711
She that they decided on and started to

1302
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,247
To install

1303
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,271
Radios on

1304
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:45,599
Some of our radio towers and were able to get pretty much the whole

1305
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,623
Geographic area

1306
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:53,279
Cool okay so you guys were doing Smart City before it was even cool it sounds like

1307
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,047
I like to see

1308
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,143
You got it

1309
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,935
Lot of stuff happened in their soul

1310
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:04,799
Talk about some of the newer things that you guys are doing I was most excited

1311
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
I think because

1312
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,335
Sounded

1313
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,639
Really beautiful and also complex

1314
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,687
This devonian Gardens

1315
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
You guys

1316
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,759
Haven't you should probably tell us what that is first

1317
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,551
And I will talk about what you've done

1318
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,343
Devonian Gardens

1319
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,135
Is the three-acre

1320
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,159
Like this

1321
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
Peaceful Refuge

1322
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,975
Depends on the top of the shopping

1323
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,511
It's one of the largest

1324
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,839
Indoor gardens of its kind and it was more than

1325
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,631
10000 ground cover plants

1326
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:35,007
Square foot living wall pond

1327
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,287
Children's play area

1328
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,335
I really kind of this Oasis

1329
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,615
Stat targaryens

1330
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,895
Go to in the middle of

1331
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
The downtown

1332
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,199
It's really impressive

1333
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,015
Space has imported exotic plants

1334
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
Tropical trees

1335
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:50,623
And it's really been

1336
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:57,535
We go through so there really precious asset that are in this Garden

1337
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,167
This unit for the main challenge for them is creating that healthy environment

1338
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,191
Or all of the

1339
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
And all these

1340
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
Tropical

1341
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,775
Interior plant

1342
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:14,431
These tropical plants life is hard for them in the middle of Calgary even if it is a nice and close to area so it's

1343
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,247
It sounds like you guys built out a sensor Network

1344
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,271
Work in

1345
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
Curious

1346
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,855
So the sensor networks measure soil moisture at measure

1347
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,391
Late for these plans

1348
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,951
And there's a feedback loop this getting built

1349
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,975
What does it look like

1350
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,767
Build something like that

1351
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,071
And how do you make it economical for the city

1352
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,607
I think the main thing for us

1353
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,887
Because we already have the

1354
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,167
Infrastructure in place

1355
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,703
Having that foundation in

1356
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,239
Place it was absolute

1357
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,287
Will be Paramount for us being able to

1358
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,335
Launcher dorwin Network

1359
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,871
Write in a lure when Network

1360
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,663
She'll really was not that it's

1361
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,431
Expensive

1362
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,711
Cuz we had that sound

1363
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:51,551
Place so we spent about 45 K on radio

1364
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,087
To be able to have the network

1365
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,111
And then

1366
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
Writing about it

1367
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,463
Software platform tools that were you

1368
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,743
Collect the data

1369
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,303
For the team itself there really are innovation

1370
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,071
Operation

1371
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,887
Citgo in try again

1372
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,655
Products

1373
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,191
You know they were crate closed

1374
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,215
See with our local

1375
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,751
University here and

1376
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,799
Next race in the field as well Jacob

1377
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,567
My GF

1378
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,407
The main Center they were looking for was a soil Monitoring Center

1379
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,943
To measure the water content

1380
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,759
And at some of the Electra

1381
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,087
Conductivity in the soil as well and so that way they

1382
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:28,671
Some kind of the understand the irrigation performance against the required

1383
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
Plants

1384
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:32,511
And that's where it's really helping our

1385
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,351
You know what they should be doing and how they

1386
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,631
Watering plants

1387
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,423
In that area or anybody

1388
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,751
The light the temperature is required to keep

1389
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,519
Keep some of those

1390
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,543
Exotic plants

1391
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,847
Healthy so how does something like this

1392
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,383
Change the job

1393
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,199
Of the staff in the gardens are they

1394
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:54,783
Now responsible for the censored networks are they still doing

1395
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,599
Like I just trying to think about once we add this

1396
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
This type of connect

1397
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:02,719
Activity and get more information out of things a lot of times that changes the job just

1398
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,999
Descriptions of some of the people

1399
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,279
The stuff

1400
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:10,655
I think this is an evolving thing I know it is in our organization is that Evolution around

1401
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,935
Havana lyrics

1402
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:17,567
And yeah really making sure that in an organization we are training

1403
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,103
People in that area

1404
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,967
And then I think an area like devonian its they could be much more precise

1405
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,503
About the work that they're doing

1406
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,111
Very very much more precise

1407
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:34,975
Excellent okay well let's move to you guys have also in addition to

1408
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,791
Hopefully making it easier and healthier for your plants

1409
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,815
You've also

1410
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
Done

1411
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,703
Project with noise pollution and understanding kind of the acoustic profile of you

1412
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:49,567
I'd love to hear more about that and what does that entail and how much of the city does

1413
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:54,687
Yeah we just done and most of these cases for tubing in Pilot mode and

1414
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,455
We really

1415
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,247
To be honest with you wanted to try

1416
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,039
Some Pilots were they weren't

1417
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,599
They weren't going to

1418
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,671
Impact and essential service necessarily right

1419
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:11,071
Turn the noise pollution and I think there's a few cities that are looking at how they monitor noise and

1420
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:14,655
I think one of the goals is really to get to what's the type of noise

1421
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,679
As well

1422
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,471
Cuz I can help in terms of

1423
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,495
You know what kind of

1424
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:21,567
Services are operations need to respond if there is something

1425
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,591
Teenager happy

1426
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,871
City project

1427
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,943
Noise monitoring with a partnership

1428
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
With

1429
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:34,111
University of Calgary so between the City of Calgary in the University of Calgary we have the program called the urban.

1430
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,415
Where you know if we have

1431
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,951
Knee problems that we're trying

1432
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,743
Thank you

1433
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
She might be

1434
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
How fast

1435
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:44,607
Ravens put those on the table of the UFC have some research

1436
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,911
To conduct and it would like

1437
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,935
Real time

1438
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,703
Problems

1439
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,727
Access

1440
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,007
Some of our facility

1441
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:51,775
Networks

1442
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,567
That they're able to do that too

1443
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,359
So it becomes a partnership

1444
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,431
Some of these research projects

1445
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,991
Umbrella so we worked with a robotics

1446
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,271
Central Network group

1447
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,319
Out of the Department of electrical and

1448
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,855
Computer Engineering at UC

1449
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,647
And they really collaborated to help

1450
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,927
Should have built this

1451
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,951
Sensor

1452
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,743
To initiate this pilot

1453
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,559
She tried it on a

1454
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,351
We have different sites

1455
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,887
Weather Sebastopol

1456
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
Typically where we get

1457
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:26,591
Complaints from citizens who live nearby about noise and we also have new ordinances bylaws

1458
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,199
They wanted to have an ability

1459
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:31,967
To be able to

1460
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,015
Understand what the noise level was

1461
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,063
I think in the future again

1462
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,599
Precision

1463
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,879
Why do we need

1464
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:42,207
Send Paula out there if we can actually get to the place where we

1465
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,791
Distinguish the type of noise it is

1466
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,863
I need to be able to have onboard so they use

1467
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,215
EBay sensors and they were placed at a carnival

1468
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,263
Circle Carnival actually can't remember what

1469
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
That played

1470
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,591
Apartments

1471
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,639
September and the senses were programmed

1472
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,199
Noise level over a window

1473
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
3 minutes

1474
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,551
The noise of a rose above

1475
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,343
E85 gas

1476
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,135
This actress sent a warning packet

1477
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,951
Through the lorwyn protocol and then

1478
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,767
Provided to concert promoters

1479
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,559
Sure

1480
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,839
You in the future is that

1481
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,375
Get that feedback to the car

1482
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
Promoters

1483
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,423
To ensure the noise

1484
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:24,959
Compliance

1485
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:29,823
So it was that happening in real-time so you can get like an alert on your phone and be like

1486
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:35,967
It was it was in the pilot we didn't quite have the connection where we were then saying

1487
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,991
Hey mister concert

1488
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:43,391
What's happening right now at your Festival

1489
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,183
Use cases going forward

1490
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,999
Kids that get up having a bunch of it

1491
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,279
Possible people who are

1492
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:52,607
Sitting there with the noise monitors were able to send them alert

1493
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,911
That say hey you're over the Bible

1494
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,447
So noise

1495
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
Sensors

1496
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
Have been

1497
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:03,103
Somewhat controversial one because of the idea that they're recording all the time and that makes

1498
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,127
People kind of uncomfortable

1499
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,943
Comfortable like can they hear conversations we don't know

1500
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,967
Some can some

1501
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,015
Can't and then the other idea

1502
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,319
I talked to somebody in the city of Busan

1503
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,855
Korea and

1504
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:20,255
They had an interesting problem where they did noise profiles in the city and in areas that were louder than

1505
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,023
Then others

1506
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,327
They publish the state on their website in the

1507
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,887
Citizens got upset cuz their property values were

1508
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,167
Declining is what they

1509
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:31,007
Said and I thought that was really interesting and doosan decided not to publicly

1510
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,567
Publish this data anymore in the website as a result

1511
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,615
How to bet but there's so many

1512
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,175
Unintended consequences so can you address

1513
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:38,943
First off

1514
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
Privacy

1515
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:44,063
Are you recording all the time and then to talk about maybe potential unintended consequence

1516
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:50,719
Yeah I like your question cuz it's something that we think about quite a bit and it needs use cases I said they're fairly

1517
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,487
Contain

1518
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,279
Not in

1519
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,303
Critical

1520
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,071
Operation

1521
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,863
The whole idea of pride

1522
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,703
Is she and where we're heading in a world of sensors I think it's something

1523
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,775
Cities as we are deploying the

1524
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,847
Sperone operations we have to make sure we're not

1525
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,639
No privacy for a citizen

1526
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,943
Is Paramount and that were not

1527
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,711
To your point

1528
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,735
The hottinger

1529
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
Unintended

1530
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:19,903
Is I don't know for these ones I don't believe for the test that we did in this one Carnival it was to the level

1531
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,183
Where you could get

1532
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,463
No individual conversate

1533
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,023
I think some of them value

1534
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,047
Looking for it

1535
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,071
You don't have comments

1536
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,095
311 noise

1537
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,375
So being able to

1538
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,679
Karachi addressed some of those noises

1539
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,215
Complaints may be one

1540
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:33,983
Future

1541
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,007
Use case

1542
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,055
Support some of those

1543
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,103
Noise bylaw violation

1544
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,639
Some of that data

1545
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,431
I have heard about

1546
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,711
Not being able to

1547
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,479
Lexus

1548
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,271
Nowhere the noisiest part of the

1549
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,831
I'm really glad that you shared that

1550
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:52,415
Example cuz those are some of the things we really need to think about you

1551
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,695
Impacts of that kind of

1552
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,487
Could be or the employee

1553
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:01,119
Okay until you guys in Calgary because you've been doing this for so long so I feel like

1554
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,399
You guys must have thought about this

1555
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,423
Do you have

1556
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,543
A digital infrastructure plan one of the challenges I think is municipalities

1557
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,591
Start putting technology in places

1558
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:15,199
They don't actually have a plan to make sure it all comes together in the end

1559
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,479
So maybe they don't have like

1560
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,271
Unified data schemes or

1561
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,319
You know interoperability between vendors

1562
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,087
So that's it

1563
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,367
Technical side but then on the

1564
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,415
Citizens side they don't actually have

1565
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,207
Policies about privacy

1566
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,999
Or how they're going to use the data

1567
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,815
And I'm curious if you guys have built that

1568
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,583
Already

1569
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,679
And I would say because of the track I think we're all on his City's those

1570
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:40,543
Strategies and need for some of those policies evolve right along the way

1571
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,847
So yeah we've had a few different strategies

1572
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:47,711
Things that work together we have a digital strategy where we really are focused

1573
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,503
On Digital Services

1574
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,831
Square citizens open data card.

1575
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,111
Did holiday

1576
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,647
And then we have another strategy

1577
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,183
Which is more round

1578
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,719
Information management

1579
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,559
Right and how are using our data.

1580
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,583
Privacy piece

1581
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,863
Lisa's part of that

1582
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:10,495
Yes for the processes that we go through before we have data out on our open data catalog

1583
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:14,335
Legacy Challenge and if we move forward into this world

1584
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,615
If we're trying to go

1585
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
Slow

1586
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,431
Enter learn from it

1587
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,967
They'll be more that we need

1588
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,991
To think about and can

1589
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,039
Consider through some of those policies

1590
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,367
So what is your neck

1591
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,391
Spec project

1592
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,927
For the Smart City going to be

1593
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,463
You know we're at city that

1594
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,487
Foothills

1595
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,279
The Prairies in the mountains

1596
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,583
Planting trees in urban canopy is

1597
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,351
Really really

1598
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,167
Golem strategy

1599
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:45,567
Until recently we really didn't have a Dependable way or measurable way

1600
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,359
Confirm that the teacher

1601
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,151
Water

1602
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,431
At the correct interval

1603
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,967
So we worked our parks

1604
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,247
Apartment 2

1605
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,575
And idea to have a water flow sensor

1606
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,367
Already have

1607
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,903
Portable GPS

1608
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,927
Cellular modem

1609
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:01,695
In there

1610
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,231
Which gives that wireless

1611
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,511
Activity

1612
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,535
Potato flour

1613
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,839
And Daddy was simple but

1614
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,863
It was complicated

1615
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:09,887
Haswell

1616
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,911
And to what we

1617
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,959
We did is we actually have

1618
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,519
Watering trucks that now having industrial-grade

1619
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,847
Water flow sensor in them and then a gif

1620
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
And allowed

1621
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,151
Viewing of

1622
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,199
Amount of water that be

1623
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:27,807
Tree in real time until they can actually see from the

1624
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,135
What that old world tree watering

1625
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,415
Progress per day

1626
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,183
Temper Trap

1627
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,207
Works like

1628
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,231
And that really helps

1629
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
Disability

1630
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,047
Yashow

1631
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,071
Tree watering

1632
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
Number one

1633
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,375
Reduce

1634
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,655
Jerry water can

1635
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,959
Nutri actually reduced

1636
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:48,799
The death of nutrients due to overwatering or underwatering

1637
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,847
And what they do

1638
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,127
To have all of their truck

1639
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,431
Did it for these water flow sensors

1640
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:57,247
That they can really use their resources

1641
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:01,599
Water and staff and contractors really effectively and efficiently

1642
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,879
To the point where they can

1643
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:06,207
Sure that their staff and their contractors are doing what their

1644
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,767
Supposed to be doing relative to the urban canopy

1645
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:13,631
I feel like we've covered a lot here and I appreciate you coming on the show this week Heather

1646
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,215
That's it for this week

1647
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,751
Thanks so much for listening
