Russell talking about the death of the Smart Home

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,072
How to get a lot of feedback on this but without debatable death

11
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,096
The debatable.

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,424
IRobot is going to share your room but data with

13
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:45,824
We've got some security flaws to talk about and we're going to talk about the death of beacons

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,848
What happened there

15
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,920
Microsoft has a vision for the smart campus we've talked a little bit about it

16
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,712
I thought we're going to talk some more about it today

17
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
And

18
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,016
We have our guest this week

And

24
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,328
Why we're currently at this weird impasse where

25
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,120
Nothing works together and we hate

26
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,192
But it is

27
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,008
This is a Downriver show death death and Hate

28
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,800

29
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
Episode but

Cake heaven

49
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
I am excited

50
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,008
I am super excited about this news because resideo

51
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
What is the name of

52
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,080
Honeywell Smart Home

53
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
Security spin-off

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,896
And it's actually going to be based in Austin

55
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
Which is where I now live

56
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
Yay

57
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
It is

58
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,064
Honeywell over a year ago and now it said it was going to spin off some of its businesses to

59
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Streamline this is

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
A popular thing that happens

61
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
Every I don't know decade or so

62
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,768
Get really big and then everything and

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
It goes on and

64
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Sperry fun

65
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,656
This time Honeywell is doing the resideo spinoff

66
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
It will be based in

67
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
In Austin

68
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,520
And it joins alarm.com control

69
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
4

70
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Scott is not

71
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,384
Public so it's going to become one of the Smart Home

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
Security publicly traded companies out there

73
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
In I think this is kind of interesting

74
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,552
Because it ties to something else you wrote

75
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
Kevin which is

76
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
About the death of the Smart Home

77
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
And I think there's a couple big themes

78
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
It's the debatable.

79
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,024
If I look at this the macro picture is

80
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
We have set the stage for the smart

81
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
Home in the sense that

82
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
People are interested in

83
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,448
Their understanding that they can provide

84
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
Greater security.

85
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,776
Which is why I think a lot of these companies are doing

86
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
Pretty well or

87
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
Thinking they will do pretty well

88
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,664
But I also think it's still way too complex for normal

89
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,712
Which is where we're getting things

90
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Dislike

91
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,784
The Professional Services in isps getting

92
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
To descend actually

93
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
A company called kaylex which

94
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
I Used to Know

95
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
Decades ago when it

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
Fiber and isps

97
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
Those guys actually launch day

98
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
Smart home Gateway

99
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,352
That will be sold through is

100
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
Spews and has Amazons

101
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
Madam a inside of it

102
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,752
Remember you guys met him a is what we

103
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,568
We call Amazon's digital assistants so as not to set off

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Assistance

105
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,920
And this is actually it's all part of this larger theme wear

106
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
DIY feels almost dead

107
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
And let's talk

108
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,576
I know I said this was about hubs but it relates Kevin you want to

109
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Can I talk about the death

110
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,184
The Hub debatable yeah yeah I'll talk about that

111
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
To clarify. Make sure for my own

112
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
Information the Presidio

113
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,679
Business that's more focused on like consumer residential type where is Honeywell still doing like industrial things

114
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
They are I do think it's weird that they

115
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Facebook that often

116
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
I thought there's a

117
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
God help me

118
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
Synergies

119
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,335
It could be had

120
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:36,479
No actually I think it's a good idea because of those synergies I mean from a technology standpoint

121
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,879
There are obvious synergies there but yet the implementation standpoint are very different between industrial and consumer

122
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
I think it's

123
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
A good idea

124
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,279
Okay well there you go and I'm thinking not industrial I'm taking more Enterprise

125
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
Christ-like

126
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
That's where

127
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,887
The health and safety those kind of things that

128
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,727
Honeywell is so good at both on the residential and Enterprise side

129
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
I think it'll be sad

130
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,383
Will Sable send me that just went public so we'll find out in the future

131
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,503
But getting back to Hubs and I understand I'm probably going to get a lot of negative feedback

132
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,831
From the die-hard readers that have had hubs

133
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,879
For years and years you know we had

134
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Maybe they had

135
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,719
Extend stuff go in an insteon hubs and so on and so forth

136
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,559
And trust me I didn't like writing this because I don't want to admit

137
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,863
Defeat but I am admitting defeat to a point

138
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:31,263
It seems to me like the hubs of today that we talked about over the past few years say your Samsung SmartThings or wink

139
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
Many others that are out there that people are using

140
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,639
Hyundai people I mean listeners and readers of the site not

141
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
Norml's

142
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,967
Back to their home DIY that you were talking about

143
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,271
I think they've been

144
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Usurped

145
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Bye

146
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,111
Apple Amazon and Google

147
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Cause

148
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,903
Those three are

149
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
Are focused far less on adding more radios to support things which we don't want to hear because

150
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,399
Ravens EP devices but these guys are focusing mainly on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi

151
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,191
Instead of focusing on radios

152
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
Deep focus on user interface

153
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
Moving over to

154
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,823
Or away from smartphones and into

155
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,895
Speakers for voice control as well as smart displays

156
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,479
And they also reached out to extend their

157
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
Integrations with

158
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
Brands

159
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:21,439
I look at some statistics as of last week Amazon says that the number of Madame a compatible devices

160
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
Tupac year to date

161
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,583
Two more than 20,000 devices from over 3,500 France

162
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,375
Google is also doing well they

163
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:35,775
I got the home holiday just introduced probably this month Google Assistant works with over 10,000 smart devices

164
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:42,175
Brands I don't think you can say the same about Samsung or wink or any of the other hubs that people that are

165
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
Our core audience might be using

166
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,271
So I think I'm illustrating the difference in the approach

167
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
And what's going to happen here is

168
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,391
Okay so the automation side of things that are missing from

169
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,463
The Big Trees I say the apples that Amazon's in

170
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,791
Google that's going to comment 3 oz Apple already has that

171
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,095
They got some automations that you can do with home

172
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
Get Sophie already there

173
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
I could easily see Amazon

174
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,823
And Google just keep building that bass apparently there's been a 50 million installed smart speakers from those two company

175
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,871
Nice so far in the US only

176
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,223
And once they keep building it up and it becomes just a matter of time y'all together in the cloud

177
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,295
And maybe pushing down local automations and such so

178
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,879
I kind of feel like the traditional smart on love is kind of dying away

179
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
I think

180
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,231
And it may not be dying so much as

181
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
It's just not right for the DIY

182
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,399
So and I would be remiss if I did not say that Amazon does have the Echo Plus

183
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
Which does have a CB radio in it

184
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,031
I would say that it is complicated and

185
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
I think

186
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
That ties back to the

187
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
Resideo and

188
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
Piknu

189
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,711
Kalyx box for isps which is

190
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,015
If you want crazy home automation

191
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,111
Really good detailed stuff you're going to get that from someone else you're going to hire that

192
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
If you are ignored

193
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
And

194
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
I think the challenge for

195
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
For those guys

196
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,791
Will be to establish business models that

197
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
Work for

198
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Consumers

199
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
So the traditional business model

200
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
There's two one is

201
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
You buy all the gear and

202
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
You pay someone to put it in and then you pay them

203
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
And come back every now and

204
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
Or you

205
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Pay fee and get all the gear

206
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
Which seems to be what you know the isps

207
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,271
Att's the alarm.com r28 which is

208
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,343
They supply all the equipment for a fixed fee

209
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,391
You're going to pay off that equipment

210
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
With a service contract

211
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
And the question is

212
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
Will people

213
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
Want to do that

214
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,143
And I think it depends on the values you get and security is still the number one value leader for

215
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
Not home automation

216
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,775
Yeah I'd be curious just bring it down to it less expensive

217
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
Products I'd be curious how many

218
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
Smart home webcam

219
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
Devices and companies

220
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Actually

221
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,991
Turn those purchases into

222
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391
Subscriptions for cloud storage of photos and such was actually really impressed so I've talked to a couple of company

223
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:04,511
Used to get numbers on their subscription services and I can't name any of them be

224
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
Because I would just be very upset with me

225
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
Me for saying this

226
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
If I named them

227
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
Ignominious

228
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
The top companies

229
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,215
The cloud subscriptions are above 50

230
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,519
50% in some cases their above

231
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
80%

232
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,591
Wow which is actually really

233
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
That the Hyatt at REI

234
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
Yeah

235
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:26,783
Subscription rate in those are $5 to $10 depending on the number of cameras depending on what you wanted to do

236
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
They're also not country

237
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
That's another thing to think about

238
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,183
Not right that they make it very easy to sign up for

239
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Can you put this device in

240
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
In your house you get like an email

241
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,815
Yeah send us your credit card here like okay

242
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
In some cases you don't even have to do that

243
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,935
Yeah let's do it

244
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
And then every month I

245
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,311
In my case with Google I get an email saying hey by the way we're going to charge you this

246
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
Okay cool

247
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,175
I do the same with nest and Canary right now

248
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,223
Yeah so it's a very different model

249
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
Then

250
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
The old one

251
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Show

252
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,855
I think all of these stories are interrelated

253
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
In a way that

254
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
Going into

255
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
29th

256
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
18

257
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,535
I think based on what we're seeing from Google Amazon in

258
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
An apple mostly Amazon

259
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
To be honest to me

260
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,911
Attaching things easier and

261
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
Voice programming easier

262
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,263
I think they're going to win at the DIY stuff

263
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
And these

264
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
Formal

265
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
Is formal installs with

266
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Probably

267
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,711
Higher level of security more sensors

268
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
More

269
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
Baby home automation

270
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
Those guys

271
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Are going to

272
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,647
Do well there but I do think I'll have to adjust their business

273
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:41,791
On the plus side something I said earlier this year is probably also wrong now if it's a

274
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
The future that were talking about

275
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
When I said hey

276
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:49,727
Smart home hubs are probably going to kill off the immigration services such as Afton stringify and so on

277
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,591
Maybe not let me get into the houses and people want all Nation

278
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
The service is certainly a value

279
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
Well we talked about this last week

280
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,759
But I saw GitHub actions remember how we talked about

281
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
That wasn't last week that was a couple weeks ago

282
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
That's kind of like

283
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
Yeah it's always been alternative

284
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:15,327
It is in Comcast bought stringify so they'll be building that into their

285
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375
Again cloud-based services

286
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,191
So maybe we'll see if gets snapped up by

287
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
Somebody who wants to make

288
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,287
Life a little easier to integrate or

289
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
Maybe

290
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,335
Amazon

291
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,015
I thought I wrote something about it I just talked to you about it like a hundred times already

292
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
Yes

293
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,135
It isn't yes to both probably Kevin has been very consistent

294
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
He would like Amazon to buy a gift and also pink

295
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,583
I'm not saying a liking to I'm just saying I could see it happen I could see why it would make sense

296
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
All right

297
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
Speaking of things that

298
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Makes sense

299
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
Or rather don't make

300
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
Let's talk about the death of

301
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
A Bluetooth Beacon

302
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,311
This is a really

303
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:02,943
I'm mad that I didn't write this story because I seen this coming for years and apparently there was a news Peg that got venturebeat

304
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Write about it so

305
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
Yay venturebeat

306
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
Paying attention

307
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,599
That news but it was actually Google turning off

308
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,391
Locations nearby

309
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
In

310
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Android

311
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
Yeah nearby notifications is gone

312
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
And most people will not miss it because

313
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
I can tell you

314
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
The only time I encounter nearby

315
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,679
Notifications popping up on my phone was at Bluetooth world

316
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,215
And I think once when I visited

317
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,799
If it doesn't have any Bluetooth for all you know it's dead

318
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,615
So basically the problem with vegans

319
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,943
Is actually very similar to some of the problems a smart home has

320
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
Text no

321
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
It's Halloween you guys

322
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Goofy as all get-out

323
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
She does this all the time not just on Halloween

324
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
But I digress

325
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,023
Standards there were two competing standards

326
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
That's always tear

327
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,887
Plus battery issues

328
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
If you put a beacon somewhere

329
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,751
You would have to find it again later and change the batteries

330
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
In some cases

331
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
People would actually movie

332
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,151
It was probably more like trickster ISM or sometimes it was just a fly

333
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,967
You know they put it someplace else

334
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
So batteries

335
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,855
Things that move you don't know where they are these are actually common problems with sensors that are

336
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
Deployed in

337
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,927
Enterprises and even in the home I have

338
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
Low battery notices uncensor sound like

339
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
There's a couple other things to a mean

340
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,911
Beacons art out as being very inexpensive and relatively speaking they are

341
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
However

342
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,519
I think almost all the major league baseball stadiums put them in

343
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
And it's not like they just put in a few pecans

344
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
They're everywhere

345
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
When you start going

346
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:41,247
And buying up hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of deacons That Azz Up really quickly

347
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,295
So from that perspective a big

348
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
Location it's not exactly cheap

349
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
And second

350
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,719
The value you get back is really limited by something not in your control

351
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,791
Do the people at your Venue have their Bluetooth

352
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,839
I never have my Bluetooth on

353
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
And

354
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,727
Not only do they have to have Bluetooth on in many cases they actually have to have

355
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
That works with

356
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
Can write on

357
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Black

358
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
Yeah there's no native

359
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
Integration with Google to try that

360
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
Buffets nearby locations in Chrome and sunset

361
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
What's the even so that

362
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
Completely out of their control

363
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
If you don't have your Bluetooth on

364
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
We just spent all that money for no

365
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
Goodbye

366
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
I have a thought

367
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:28,863
I would still love to see these Technologies weathers ibeacon or Eddystone Etc I would still love to see

368
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,423
CDs continue in the home because

369
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
I think they could work well for

370
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,055
Presence even if I had to wear a silly little Bluetooth tag on my belt or something

371
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Why would you need that

372
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
You have your phone on you

373
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
At all times

374
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,479
That's not true but I don't leave again I don't leave Bluetooth on I guess I would in that case

375
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
So I think

376
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
Instead of physical because there's a lot of

377
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,367
Interesting plays here around virtual

378
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,207
So there are companies like missed that are creating

379
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Basically they

380
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
Could access points and now that we're seeing

381
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,583
Bluetooth actually in Wi-Fi hubs

382
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
This is possible in other places

383
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
That's where you basically

384
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Can

385
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
Be a software

386
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Create

387
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
Oracle pékin

388
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,543
Place them in a

389
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,359
Room or place them in where the Wi-Fi

390
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Knows there's a

391
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
Basically

392
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
And

393
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,015
While I you have presence detection you have some of the same functionality

394
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
And

395
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,367
If there were a standard for this would you be amazing then

396
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
Other

397
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,951
Smart home devices or Enterprise devices

398
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
Could use it in the Enterprise

399
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,023
You may actually

400
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Senior Corp

401
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
Phone have something

402
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
When you're inside the

403
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
Campus so it's less of a

404
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,447
They're what we need their though

405
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Is

406
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,007
One Bluetooth and ask

407
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,823
Access points possibly that standard and three

408
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
Really good mapping

409
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
Which

410
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
Good sake

411
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,711
Brings us to our next story

412
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Owosso

413
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Which is

414
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
IRobot

415
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,159
The makers behind Roomba

416
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Have

417
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,999
Can I deal with Google where they will mine

418
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,607
Google's going to use the mapping data that comes off of certain Roomba Vacuum

419
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
And

420
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
Then it can establish

421
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
Accurate Maps

422
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,495
In a sense I can add presents

423
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,055
For a Roomba service you can say

424
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
Hey Google

425
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
Tell Roomba to clean

426
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,431
He will know where the family room is

427
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
Because it has the mapping

428
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
And Google Assistant

429
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,599
Target that particular room so that that's more value to the room itself

430
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:30,463
So I think that is actually that's a really good point to make because I think that is the bare minimum you have to

431
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
Tudu tudu Dada

432
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
You have to offer the user some value

433
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
And tell Google she's very smart

434
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,631
He said he hears about you can say go do this

435
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
But

436
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,727
It also allows Google to understand

437
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
What's in your

438
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
Where it is

439
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
And

440
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,895
It's a possibility that hey that could be either matchcrete those for

441
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,967
To be a way to understand

442
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
Kevin you said presents but

443
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
You know usually I leave when my

444
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
Is there so I'm not in

445
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,135
All of this is supposed to be opt

446
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,975
And it will not be used by Google's ad service

447
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,559
So that's that's a big plus for a lot of people like that

448
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,655
And Google is quoted in one of the stories that we read about the

449
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
This as

450
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
Saying this is basically

451
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,287
Not just a smart home but a way to create a thoughtful

452
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
It requires less information from

453
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,895
In Kevin and I call this context

454
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
And I do think

455
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,967
That's actually true so

456
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
Yay

457
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
I may have to get a room again

458
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,855
Victor doesn't clean up the

459
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,415
Crumbs to Willy's only like 3 inches tall so

460
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
Takes a long time to clean up and vacuum

461
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,023
Oh he could be like honey when you're in a fancy restaurant like

462
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,983
Get I just got the alpha of the SDK for Vector so maybe home

463
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
There you go

464
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
You do need to come

465
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
I'll look forward to that video

466
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,175
And could you put them in a little touch

467
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
I could do that

468
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
I could

469
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
All right so that's the

470
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
Roomba Google News

471
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
Who's and

472
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
Speaking of context

473
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,207
Microsoft has a vision for the smart office

474
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
Bad

475
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
They showed off in a video that

476
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
You know

477
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
I actually saw the watch

478
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
It's worth a watch to see what you can

479
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,679
Do eggs also kind of a UI cluster

480
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
In my opinion

481
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,751
But that could just be like the demonstration ask

482
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
So

483
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,591
In this video you swipe your employee badge again

484
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
And something in the wall

485
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
It knows where you are in the

486
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,687
It also can't answer it Scott

487
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
Cortana in there so it's answering

488
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Questions about the

489
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
Hey where can I find sushi

490
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
I like oh it's in this cafeteria

491
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
Here's the menu items

492
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,903
Oh hey I'm here for my meeting

493
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
That ties into Outlook and you

494
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
You can send out

495
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,047
Boom everybody's in the meeting except you where are you

496
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
All that seems cool

497
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,935
That is cool and I've actually been looking at bikes Mart

498
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Workspaces

499
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,519
Couple years when I was back with Google it was fun

500
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,407
Topix I was researching and so on what I like about this aside from those examples of a show-off

501
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
They also

502
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
Show how

503
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:05,087
Again contacts the right information at the right place and time is super important for pretty much anything in the office

504
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
Presently said we can put one of these

505
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,671
In the bathroom or near the bathroom

506
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,743
And if there is maybe a water issue it is a leak or something

507
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
You could swipe your badge

508
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,327
It knows where you are knows who you are

509
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
And says what can I help you with

510
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:21,471
There's a leak in this bathroom please open a trouble ticket but system would say okay got it

511
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Trouble ticket

512
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,079
Assigned and opened and I know where the bathroom is I know what the problem is

513
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,359
And the reason they say that

514
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
It's important because

515
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,455
In a regular office you probably to go all the way back to your desk

516
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:37,855
To make a phone call to facilities and so on what you're more than likely going to get stop by other people on your way back to the desk you're going to be thinking about work

517
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,927
Things and you're not going remember to actually open the ticket

518
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,207
That is true in

519
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
Here's what I'd like to

520
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,303
Just based on that and this was again a video with

521
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,607
Anchor was talking to a person about

522
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
The project

523
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
1

524
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,423
Sweating your badge

525
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,215
Before like to exchange information

526
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
But the system

527
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
Felt like

528
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,799
Not a lot of work but you may not

529
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,127
Right so I felt like for things like notifying you of a water leak

530
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
Having a screen there

531
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Would be really helpful

532
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
They can say hey what are they

533
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,039
Right or conference in progress and a lot of these screens exist

534
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
Places today

535
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,855
The other aspect

536
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,719
Abyss that I didn't love was there still a lot of things you shouldn't do.

537
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,767
Voice so like when it started listening

538
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
The places where I can find sushi

539
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
I was like oh my God

540
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
Stop talking

541
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:25,727
But but but it also did say for more information and it wanted you to an internal campus

542
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,823
App for the map and that's been using all that I would love to see

543
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
I agree

544
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
Open the app to see this

545
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,455
The echo a party does this Google does this

546
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
What's Google Assistant

547
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
I know that Microsoft

548
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,831
They're not a lot of Microsoft phones

549
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
Are there still Microsoft phones out there

550
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,951
But there's still some out there there's no new ones

551
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
But there are still some out

552
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:52,607
Either shoot it over my phone or have it at programmable NFC tag or something that opens the app for me or something

553
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,887
Yes cuz I already got a swipe

554
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
Something other than swiping

555
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
So many things

556
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
Hajj will be

557
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,847
My phone my NFC chip will be in my hand

558
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
Or that

559
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,687
But then you see this stuff

560
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
Okay

561
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
Okay

562
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
So that's Microsoft smart

563
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,807
Office I will also say

564
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,111
To me this was probably super practical but

565
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,672
The coolest Microsoft smartoffice demo I've ever seen

566
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,464
It's still the one from build

567
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,024
Where you walked into the conference room it had like

568
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,584
Cortana on this magical pyramid sitting on the

569
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
The conference room table that hand

570
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,912
The calls and also had eye thing

571
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Take a camera and

572
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
Recognize who is in the room

573
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,008
And they were using a AI that would

574
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
Basically create

575
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,824
To do notes from your meeting

576
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,408
The conversation so if someone said okay I'm going to follow up on that

577
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
I'll check

578
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
Calendar date

579
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
Get back to you

580
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,784
It would actually we need that we so need that

581
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,880
Yeah until it breaks down and then all office product

582
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,208
What happens today when email or Slack

583
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
There's a lot of hanging this show

584
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
Sorry you guys

585
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
Oh and speaking of

586
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,936
Let's talk about security issues Kevin

587
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,752
Scary research say that the Google home hub is in

588
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Sure

589
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,056
Google unsurprisingly is

590
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
Saints

591
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
Insecure

592
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
What's new

593
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:14,272
There's a lot of houhai about this over the past few days and it all comes from the source of a personal blog by

594
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
Jerry

595
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
Gambling

596
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,856
ESI Security advocate

597
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,416
He started nosing around

598
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,464
Once you got a Google home harbin

599
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,024
I scanned the network

600
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,424
And saw what I was doing and he saw a bunch of open TCP ports after about 15

601
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,448
5 minutes

602
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,240
He figured out using an

603
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,032
Undocumented API

604
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:42,432
That was one crew command he could reboot the Google home hub which puts it right back up in setup mode

605
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
Google home app

606
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,064
And I totally understand that probably should not be allowed

607
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,648
Insecure

608
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:57,280
All kinds of back doors and people getting information there's no information that can be gotten from resetting

609
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
The Hub

610
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
By this method

611
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,912
And the fact is you have to be on the same Wi-Fi network to actually exploit this

612
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,704
So there's an awful lot of

613
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,008
Parameters here that I don't think

614
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
Make this a huge issue

615
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,360
That's what Google was unsurprisingly saying you know

616
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
If you do reset it

617
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,736
Wouldn't cuz you're not loading them through

618
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,784
Because like resets would be bad for someone like

619
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,344
Those are actually on the device

620
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
Itself so that

621
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Descanso

622
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,976
If you just reset this basically you're going to lose your

623
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:35,680
So somebody resets whether they unplug my Hub bore do this I mean yeah that is going to cause those kind of pro

624
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
For sure but

625
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
Again I'm like

626
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,544
Is it really insecurity kind of thing

627
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
Going to come from a standpoint I don't think so

628
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,176
Shouldn't be allowed in happen to know what's your name Google search Patchett

629
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:51,296
I just saw so many stories this weekend I know I don't have a Google home hub so I wasn't gets her to begin with

630
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,112
I don't think people need to be overly concerned about this

631
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
Yeah I have

632
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
The sunset

633
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
I tell people I'm like look

634
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,720
You got to evaluate

635
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
Ideas for what they really

636
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
Do in German

637
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,096
Profiling that's not something apparently most media do yet

638
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Unfortunate

639
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
Is there some really scary things out

640
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,752
Hey speaking of scary other things that we

641
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
Is

642
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
What's the weather hijacking

643
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
Connected Construction

644
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,152
Because I feels like

645
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,480
I could be related to related question where you just recently in Vegas

646
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
I was

647
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,320
Did you know that the official City bird is a crane

648
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,624
That used to be the joke in Austin

649
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
I'm sorry

650
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,816
Why were using City jokes now anyway

651
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,888
Yeah so this is a very unique interesting

652
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,448
Security issue

653
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:46,848
Connected Construction crane made by telecrane that literally has a connections that the

654
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:50,688
Operator the crane has some assistance in terms of how to

655
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,248
Run this thing and

656
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,784
But there is an exploit

657
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,576
That has been documented

658
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:00,672
That is an authentication bypass by capture replay

659
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,232
And what happens if a Suleiman in the middle attack

660
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,536
And somebody could theoretically

661
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,584
Spoof commands to hijacker

662
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,472
Crane and that's really bad because that's not just like a simple reboot where nobody gets hurt that somebody could like

663
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
Demolish a building for all we know

664
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
So

665
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
So

666
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,128
Like you never know

667
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
That is an example of something that

668
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,480
It's unlikely but the potential harp

669
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
Is huge exactly

670
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
So

671
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,576
We should probably be a little bit more worried about that

672
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
Nanjing

673
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,672
We are so are they going to patch it

674
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:38,560
They actually have in the latest firmware telecrane has it available so construction companies can actually get it and

675
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Betty

676
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,352
Transformer

677
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,632
Yay

678
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,680
So actually if you're operating a telegram

679
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,984
Update

680
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
Chicken wire

681
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,032
Firmware

682
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
Okay

683
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,592
And because I am on the show

684
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Kevin is

685
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
Kind person that let's talk about chips

686
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
Because

687
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,504
For all of us who care so much about Edge AI

688
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
There is a

689
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,808
It's actually not a new chip

690
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,600
Company I've written about it very briefly

691
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,696
Before in the newsletter but this is a company doing a j i

692
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
And they're doing it

693
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,000
Increasingly low power

694
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,280
Which is awesome

695
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,560
It's sentient

696
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,584
And it has

697
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,960
Scored 25 million in a series B round it is led by Microsoft Amazon

698
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,008
Mattamy fund Intel capital

699
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,800
And other investors who are like

700
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,128
Yes please can we get low-power AI at the edge

701
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,176
What's cool about sentient

702
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
And there's no

703
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
Are you doing the style

704
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,784
Of processing called Mythic

705
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,160
Is they are getting their low-power by doing the computation in memory

706
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
As opposed to on

707
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
The processor

708
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,000
This is a fundamental change in the way

709
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
Computers

710
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
And

711
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
It's pretty exciting

712
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
We'll have to see how this works

713
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
In the real world

714
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,192
But it's power consumption

715
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
Is crazy low

716
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
Kevin do you remember what the

717
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
Assumption was

718
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,104
I don't think I mentioned the power consumption but they said that it's 8:20

719
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
Cara Operations

720
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
Yes

721
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
Which is

722
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
Yes

723
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,040
So yes this is a

724
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,600
Possibly big game-changing kind of piece of

725
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Technology

726
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,160
As it with all chip stories

727
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
Kind of debate

728
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
But keep an eye on it

729
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Cuz

730
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
We definitely need to

731
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
Okay

732
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
No

733
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
He feels like time

734
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,936
We're actually getting kind of roof riser

735
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,544
4r voicemail from the iot podcast hotline

736
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,848

00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,648
We have a winner this month for our door lock

743
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
Test

744
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,232
Let me grab that guy's name

745
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,256
Our winner is

746
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:48,608
Michael who is actually the person who we're taking the voicemail from this weekend

747
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
Coincidence that has now happened

748
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,496
And we will start the contest a new

749
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,056
In November so if you would like to

750
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,848
When a Schlage door lock

And you will be entered to win

757
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,624
That number is 512

758
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
63

759
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
7 4

760
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
To 4

761
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
And

762
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,768
Now let's hear from Michael

763
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
PlayStation Kevin

764
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
This is Michael

765
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,096
Rochester New York

766
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,144
I don't know what I'm looking for exist

767
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,424
But I'm hoping you can help me

768
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,472
I have a few lifx smart bulbs

769
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
Only recently dawned on me

770
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,056
A place to put another ball

771
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,104
The laundry room by the motion sensor

772
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,408
This way

773
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
I don't currently have any kind

774
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Smart Hub

775
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,808
I'm trying to avoid getting one is a lifx bulbs work on Wi-Fi

776
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,368
I tried searching for wifi-connected motionsense

777
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,672
But all I could find were some that are part of

778
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
Home security kit

779
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,256
I couldn't tell if they would work with stringify

780
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,560
Do you know of any Wi-Fi motion sensor

781
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,352
That would work with what I'm trying to

782
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632
Do and if not

783
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
Which Smart Hub

784
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Ecosystem

785
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,216
Will you recommend I get into

786
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,544
I'm also wondering if you're aware of any weather

787
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,592
I can use

788
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,640
Is whatever solution I need to go with

789
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
My laundry room

790
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,456
I have a couple of the lifx Plus

791
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,016
Bulbs in my flood light above the front door

792
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,296
Help with the night-vision.

793
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,576
Hello doorbell

794
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
Okay

795
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,440
It is the death of Hub having a rate

796
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
Here

797
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,512
So it's unclear from your voicemail Michael

798
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
If you are using

799
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Homekit

800
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,632
So we decided to answer this question in two ways one

801
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
If you're using homekit we have a solution

802
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,984
For you and two if you're not using home

803
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,264
Explain

804
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,568
Why that may be kind of an issue for you in

805
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
Talk to you around it

806
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,128
Sounds like you're using stringify

807
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,456
If you're using homekit

808
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:45,856
What you could do is get a pumpkin motion sensor say one from fibaro

809
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
Search for the laundry room door

810
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:52,512
Typically close our door so we don't have to hear all that noise

811
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,792
But either one would work

812
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,864
And because those are Bluetooth sensors you would not need a hub

813
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,936
Although you technically would have a hug with homekit anyway

814
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:06,336
Could with an Apple iPad or an Apple TV regardless in the home app you can create an automation to have that work

815
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,360
Okay

816
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,176
And so evil also makes one of these sensors I'm going to add a little

817
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Caveat there

818
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,760
You will want a hub in your home

819
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,832
Because if you doing laundry and you don't have your phone with you

820
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
It's not going to

821
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,208
Well it depends on how far your laundry room is

822
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
Sy what

823
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
That is

824
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,608
Now I will say macroview

825
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
Is a great

826
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
Great system

827
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,472
I actually have the exact same thing in my laundry room

828
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
And I love it

829
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,288
Here's where it gets complicated

830
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,568
It if you don't use home

831
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,384
You might find a Wi-Fi sensor and we did find several

832
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,688
But there's no way necessarily

833
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,992
To tell that Wi-Fi motion sensor

834
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,040
To turn on your lifx light

835
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,576
Because you don't have that

836
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,600
Interoperability

837
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,368
Lair

838
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
Which is what homework

839
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
So

840
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,464
In that case

841
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,744
You can buy a

842
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,024
Wi-Fi sensor

843
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
And the bad news is

844
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
There's none that are great

845
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,936
Police are the reviews that we've seen at least for the reviews iHome makes one there's a

846
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,472
A couple of no-name brands

847
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
Make one so what you're going to look for

848
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,056
D-Link actually has one

849
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
That works with

850
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,128
If you're going to look for something that works with

851
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
But if or stringify

852
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
Is a wifi-based sensor

853
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
And then

854
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,552
Gil Hughes after stringify to set up the

855
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,856
When this detects motion

856
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,440
Turn on lights and then you're also going to have a toggle that says

857
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,256
After a certain number of minutes turn off the lights

858
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
Emotions.

859
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
So keep that in my

860
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,840
I'm going to

861
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
Tell you

862
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
Hugh

863
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
Makes

864
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,240
Everything you need to do this it is a little bit expensive

865
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,032
But that's what I'm using in my

866
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,336
Laundry room and in my master bedroom

867
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,176
I use plain white hue light bulbs and I

868
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:49,248
Use a Hue motion sensor and I set that up inside

869
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,064
So that way you're not going

870
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,088
Whole home hub

871
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
And the Hue hub

872
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
Talk stoop

873
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
Google

874
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,440
Anime

875
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
And homekit

876
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
So

877
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,560
That would be what I would tell you to do I know it's not ideal

878
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
And then you do have a hub

879
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
So I've all those options

880
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,192
I feel like we've given you the tools you need to

881
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:08,960
Find the right

882
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,312
Do you have a preference on HUB ecosystem at all

883
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Personally

884
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,128
You know the Hue ecosystem is really nice

885
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
They keep working on it

886
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
So

887
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,456
Now if we're talking about like

888
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,736
SmartThings

889
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
Or wink

890
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
Iperf

891
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
Wink

892
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
As do I

893
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,600
Because it's just easier to

894
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
So

895
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,648
Michael

896
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,696
I hope this helps you feel free

897
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,488
To let us know what you decide to go with

898
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,536
Curious and

899
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:37,632
Hopefully this helps anyone else out there and I will say I do love that particular interaction

900
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
Very helpful

901
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
That really

902
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,496
That takes us to the end of the News 7

903
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
Event for this week

904
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,544
And stay tuned

905
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312

Our Guest Alexander Edition

907
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
Who is going to be

908
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,712
Really dropping some serious knowledge about building a smart home

909
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Home design

910
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,504
And business

911
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
Opportunities in

912
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,832
What has happened

913
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
In the last

914
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,136
120 years and

915
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,952
So stay tuned for that

916
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,816
And now let's hear a message from our sponsor good Defender

917
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:11,680
Taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor

918
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:16,800
This week sponsor is bitdefender and I have Alex belant who is Chiefs

919
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
Security researcher

920
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,896
So this week we're talking about

921
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,688
Parental control

922
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
And bitdefender box

923
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,016
This is your smart home Cyrus

924
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,064
And as a parent

925
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
I wanted to ask you

926
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
Can technology

927
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,696
Parents concerns around things like

928
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
Bling

929
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Shirts online

930
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
Yes absolutely

931
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,560
Think about it

932
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,168
Because most solutions

933
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
Tacolicious

934
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,984
Oriental

935
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,968
We've designed a component

936
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,440
That's going to be notified

937
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
Can parents rely

938
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,480
Watford

939
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,624
With somebody

940
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,976
Or when there's an exchange

941
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
Or when somebody ask

942
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
Apple

943
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,408
Have a conversation

944
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,528
Okay how does this protect my

945
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
My child

946
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,640
How exactly

947
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,688
Can technology help with

948
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
Allaying

949
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
Parents concerns

950
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
Technologies.

951
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,600
Will be able to monitor

952
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,744
Domestication to the Palace

953
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,096
You will have to have a

954
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
Privacy

955
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,592
This sounds reassuring

956
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
So where

957
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
H&R the stairs

958
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
How to find out

959
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,968
Absolutely they can go to

960
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:19,072
Everyone will go back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

961
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,632
Is Alexandra deschamps sonsino

962
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,656
Alex

963
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:26,240
She is an industrial designer and the author of a brand new book

964
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,264
Call smarter homes

965
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,568
How technology will change your whole life

966
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
Hi Alex how are you doing today

967
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:38,016
I'm really well Stacey thank you for having me probably

968
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,088
And we've actually communicated for years you are

969
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,160
Add iot watch on Twitter

970
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,976
Product for the internet

971
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,512
Cash was at 2013

972
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
Good night lamp

973
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:53,632
I actually came up with in 2005 but will ignore them

974
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,424
I made my

975
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
First batch in 20

976
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,008
So and this was a great idea

977
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,544
This was basically

978
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
When you turned on this lamp

979
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,920
Somewhere else in the world to someone who has a corresponding lamp it would turn on

980
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,200
For them

981
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,480
The idea was just a

982
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,760
Easy way to communicate

983
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,552
Guess where you were in your day

984
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
Describe

985
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,440
Well I like to think of it as a nice way of sharing presence and availability

986
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,768
4 family members in a different time zone it's really nice

987
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,304
They're saying

988
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,352
Colin Moran right now

989
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:29,216
And it just opens up that space and that day-to-day routine with your family

990
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,752
You been doing this awhile

991
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,032
You have practical experience

992
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,360
I feel like we are war-torn individuals in a smart home

993
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,152
So what made you

994
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
Do this

995
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,992
I wanted to write a book for the longest time

996
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:47,392
And I sort of looked at the smart home space because designing the goodnight land being an industrial designer by training

997
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
Working with

998
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,440
Super large brands

999
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,000
Customers through the years as a consultant

1000
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,840
I sort of knew a lot about the space and I thought oh well I'm sure you know I

1001
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:02,240
I can do more research but someone else is booked to and I really couldn't find anything beyond a bunch of

1002
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
Chiropractor

1003
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,032
Pickle

1004
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:04,800
Somehow

1005
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,592
You know quite dry books

1006
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,384
Networking in the house

1007
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,176
But most of them were very old

1008
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,736
And most of them were very very specific

1009
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:18,624
And I'm a little bit of a design because well coming from industrial design and interaction design so I thought it would

1010
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,416
Would be really interesting to look at

1011
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,952
How often we've heard

1012
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
About

1013
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,024
What's this idea of the home of the future

1014
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,584
Really

1015
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,888
50s

1016
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:34,752
Efficient home at the turn of the last century but we've always had to serve obsession with

1017
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,312
And I wanted to explore that in the book

1018
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,360
Going back through history

1019
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,688
What has changed cuz when I take a smart home now I think

1020
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:45,760
Oh internet connectivity and that's probably what most people

1021
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,296
Or actually

1022
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,320
If you had asked me

1023
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
Probably

1024
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
Six or seven years ago that's what I

1025
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,648
What I said

1026
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
And now

1027
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:57,792
I feel like I would say oh well it's got to be connected to the internet but more importantly it has to have some sort of

1028
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
Intuitive help

1029
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,864
For me it has to have some sort of AI

1030
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
Capabilities so it's not just

1031
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
Code access to

1032
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
But I'm curious what your

1033
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,520
Take on the evolution of the efficient home

1034
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
To the Smart Home

1035
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,384
But I think that your description is pretty accurate

1036
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
In the sense that

1037
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,456
I think for both you and I are

1038
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:22,112
People working in the technology space and we probably think of a smart home is being a technologically enabled home

1039
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,392
Where is actually free to

1040
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,928
Become a reality quote

1041
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:29,536
Get a lot more people to buy something that turns their home

1042
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:33,120
From what they have now which they might not think of his smart

1043
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:38,752
They just think of is their home into a quote-unquote smart home and how you get someone

1044
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
2

1045
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:45,152
The face really is I think the history of every new consumer technology

1046
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:50,016
So we might try to convince people to voice assistant right now

1047
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,552
Connected thermostat

1048
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
But that's because

1049
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,136
We tried to convince people to buy

1050
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,672
Completely you

1051
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,976
Brand spanking new homes with loads

1052
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,304
Things embedded in it we used to call it domotics in the 90s

1053
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,608
Comes back to a bunch

1054
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,424
People who met actually in the US

1055
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,240
Something called the smart house project in 1987

1056
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,056
And the point there was to say how it's going to be like

1057
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,384
Even IBM got involved and has

1058
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:24,320
And you could buy the retrofitting of your entire home with connectivity which

1059
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,856
Set the timer

1060
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,416
The web as we know it now but

1061
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:32,256
Early internet aurelly technologies and early app

1062
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,024
Applications of

1063
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,840
New technologies for your home to make your home life better

1064
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
Quote unquote

1065
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
What I found

1066
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,704
Was that actually the definition of what makes a home better is

1067
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,032
Exactly the same definition as 50 years ago which is not

1068
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
Too far away from

1069
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,104
Years ago so

1070
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,664
The story of how we talked about

1071
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,456
Conductivity in the home hasn't changed

1072
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
And that I was really shocked

1073
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,528
Okay yes

1074
00:40:54,784 --> 00:41:00,672
And I remember going to an IBM smart home in like 2004 and they had like RFID interactions like an

1075
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,208
Kitchen counter that would interact

1076
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
Food bags in your medicine

1077
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,048
It was crazy out there

1078
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,072
Kind of need

1079
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
Disintegrated

1080
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:13,472
Which brings me to something you've written about in your book

1081
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
Witches

1082
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,264
The way that

1083
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,104
This sort of stuff Creeps in is not the way the tech world

1084
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
Tends to work

1085
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,664
Eclipse in individually

1086
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
Entire cyst

1087
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
Yeah absolutely

1088
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,832
I think there's something kind of quite fun and interesting about how

1089
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:35,488
Technology Giants tend to look at the homes face as if it was a comprehensive system like Vino etcetera

1090
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:40,096
A coyote

1091
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,120
Mathematically

1092
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:46,496
Ansible system of things that connect other things and somehow there's a trickle-down effect

1093
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,056
Between the use of one thing

1094
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,848
Intriguer other things

1095
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
Because that

1096
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,175
Systems diagram is so appealing

1097
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,223
Mathematically and computationally

1098
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:00,319
And that's how we build against the web but it's really not how we build

1099
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:04,671
Tom making and how we operate and think about our homes most of us

1100
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,951
Want to

1101
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:10,815
Turn the key in the morning to leave for work and not think about the house forever more

1102
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,375
But somehow we are

1103
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,167
You know meant to be buying

1104
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:18,239
Products that will make us think about the home all the time

1105
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,311
Notifications all the time about the home space

1106
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:25,407
Which we were kind of hoping we're just leave behind and get on with our day and

1107
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,735
Go see your friends or go out or whatever it is

1108
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,039
But now we have this kind of needy child

1109
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:35,391
It's part of a larger system that includes our location

1110
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:39,231
You have this

1111
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:44,863
Square systems affect that's being created for us that I don't think is really that appealing

1112
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,959
I think it's also a weird thing to want to

1113
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:53,567
Get people to do which is to just change their lifestyle from one day to the next

1114
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
Because

1115
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,639
Technology

1116
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,407
Change your life

1117
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,199
Lifestyle even when it's just

1118
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,991
Baez sterilizer

1119
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:07,903
Eat your vegetables in the shape of spaghetti it's a lifestyle change

1120
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:12,511
For those of you guys who are into the zoodles are

1121
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Bikini noodles

1122
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,911
So I think every purchase is a leap of faith and

1123
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,703
To think that an average

1124
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,983
Normal household

1125
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:28,383
Who have you know so many other fish to fry they've got jobs to keep they've got families Health to come

1126
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,407
Kind of tend to

1127
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,711
Did they suddenly want a whole bunch of

1128
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,039
Complex interdependence interactions with their home

1129
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,319
I think is really

1130
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,087
Strange

1131
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,623
That actually is true

1132
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,951
Feel like a couple weeks ago there were a couple articles out

1133
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
Talked about this

1134
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,535
Backlash in this idea that the whole movie

1135
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,095
Neurotic so somebody wrote about their

1136
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,143
Connected doorbell and they were like you know

1137
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
Every now and then I get these

1138
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,495
Notifications and they say something happened outside my home

1139
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,543
Can I freaked out and then I'm like

1140
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,895
Eventually this person took it out cuz they were like

1141
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,919
I don't want these nuts

1142
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
Location

1143
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,711
Very astute

1144
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,271
So where can technology

1145
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,551
Actually help

1146
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
Improve our life

1147
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,111
Still work with it

1148
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,135
Existing

1149
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,183
I guess systems are what we think we

1150
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,999
But I think that there

1151
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,535
Key and core

1152
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,351
Marketplaces for smart

1153
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,679
Technology

1154
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
Trying

1155
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:28,287
New technologies the most around me and this is anecdotal

1156
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,079
It's always been you parrot

1157
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,127
New parents who are supportive

1158
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,151
Completely

1159
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,199
You know I'm taken aback by the task

1160
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:39,551
Skip and a new task at hand of raising a small child and

1161
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
Suddenly Annie

1162
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,695
Time that you can shave off of even switching the lights on is a welcome

1163
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:49,023
Intrusion in a sentence and so I do think that

1164
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,071
For some people these applications

1165
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,095
Useful

1166
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,935
It's just they're not useful at scale that I think most

1167
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:01,567
Large companies would be happy with because apart from home computers mobile phones

1168
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:06,431
Large appliances we share almost nothing of our home life

1169
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,967
We don't have the same

1170
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,247
Furniture we don't

1171
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,319
The same decorations you know we don't share the same

1172
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:15,135
Comings and goings and so we can't buy

1173
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,159
Unmask

1174
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,183
The same things

1175
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,975
Yes we'll probably all by you

1176
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,535
The usual toilet paper ends

1177
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,327
Instant coffee or something but

1178
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,863
That's actually rare

1179
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,399
And so I think that there is

1180
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:29,471
Going to be very nice uses for

1181
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,263
Specific products to

1182
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:36,127
Make our lives easier to a degree but I also think that we probably have

1183
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Comcast

1184
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,943
The point where we do want to make our lives

1185
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,967
Home easier

1186
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,503
I think we want our lives

1187
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:45,855
Outside of home to be easier especially women especially in 2018

1188
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,391
And I think that there is

1189
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,439
An interesting dynamic

1190
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,719
For companies to think about

1191
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,999
The think about what

1192
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,279
Women's lives

1193
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:59,423
Because women tend to be the audience for smart home devices and what their needs

1194
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:04,799
Because actually remote access might be something that you really want but

1195
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,103
Not necessarily for the doorbell

1196
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,431
Might be for something else entirely so thinking laterally and think

1197
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,455
Thinking outside of the

1198
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:14,015
The helm box is it where I think is really

1199
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,807
The next job for large companies

1200
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:21,695
OC and I'm thinking about you know hey I would love for it to be easier to buy my toilet paper and that's where things like you know

1201
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,231
Amazon has the dash buttons

1202
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,767
Are some interesting Fifth Element

1203
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,607
Things out their ideas that have been tried Target try to program

1204
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,375
Carfax

1205
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,143
You had like

1206
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,983
Connected soap dispensers and I think I connected toilet paper roll actually

1207
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
It would

1208
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,311
Put this in your home

1209
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,591
Connected to the internet

1210
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,615
And when it

1211
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,175
Became low you could set it to automatic

1212
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,199
Reorder things

1213
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,991
People didn't trust it

1214
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,783
Betch didn't even make all of its money that

1215
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,111
I think there's also something

1216
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:50,879
Sunny

1217
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,647
About

1218
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:58,047
Treating the home in this is something that comes back to early 1900s sort of ear I would just treating the home

1219
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,583
The factory floor

1220
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,119
Like things have to be

1221
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,935
Fulfilled like you are you know

1222
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,495
Buying new materials to

1223
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,031
Make a jet engine

1224
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
Car

1225
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,079
That's not the relationship

1226
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,359
People have with

1227
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,687
Something even a stupid is toilet paper or soap

1228
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,247
You make different decisions on soap

1229
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
Continuously

1230
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,063
I'm always kind of

1231
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,343
Trying new brands

1232
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:27,231
Actually Four brand this is really important for them competitive

1233
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:32,863
Stapled to the point that people just completely stopped thinking

1234
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,935
It's been a case for British banks for example

1235
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:40,031
As everyone moves to digital banking people don't necessarily

1236
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,823
Know about any other bank

1237
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,383
Keep the physical

1238
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,967
Stores in the physical bank tellers they have

1239
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,319
Retail presence in order for people to know that there are there bags

1240
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:58,719
And so I think in the home we always want to know you know what what is the newest so by could be buying

1241
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:02,559
Because it's you know sulfate-free paraben-free whatever

1242
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,607
What are the better decisions like

1243
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,887
I could be making for my family

1244
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,935
Play end I want to keep those options open

1245
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,959
I am not

1246
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,031
Running a industrial facility I'm running a home

1247
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:17,407
I like that okay so running a home what are the things then where are the opportunities

1248
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,455
For companies to come in

1249
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,247
And make a difference you talked about new pair

1250
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:25,855
Terrence yeah I think aging-in-place is interesting but there is a paradox at most

1251
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
We're older

1252
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,415
They don't want to be monitored

1253
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,207
This feels very invasive

1254
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:30,975
Are my privacy

1255
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
So

1256
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,303
Totally I mean

1257
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,327
Yeah

1258
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:40,703
Beijing conundrum is also a social

1259
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,263
And I think that companies example

1260
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
Voice assist

1261
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,311
I would love

1262
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:50,943
To see them take more of a leap of faith in actually supporting families who have

1263
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,967
Complex needs

1264
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,015
I don't really see why

1265
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,599
Assistant with any voice functionality wooden

1266
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,135
Also unable

1267
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,439
Someone who falls in their home to

1268
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,463
Call out for help

1269
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,535
And for the service to be called true that boys assist

1270
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,863
That should be something that companies do want to take on

1271
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,399
It might be done through

1272
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:16,799
Some more open source Voice assistance and might be something that's already come out but I mean I just haven't heard about it and I

1273
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,823
I think that that

1274
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,687
Social care peace is not necessarily going to be resolved by something you can buy

1275
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:28,831
But it is definitely going to be something that something like the goodnight lamp in part does That Trick

1276
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,879
Which is to make people more at ease about

1277
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,415
But there are

1278
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
How to be others

1279
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,511
There ought to be other ways in which someone can actually

1280
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,583
Connect their neighbors connect to their Community connect their City

1281
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,143
Because most older people are living alone

1282
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
And that's the

1283
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:49,823
So all the effort that we put into convincing people to buy more soap or soap more consistently I think we ought to think about

1284
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,127
How to get people to socialize

1285
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,919
I like it

1286
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:54,943
Talking about

1287
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,991
People you have an interesting point

1288
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:57,759
About

1289
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
Power dynamic

1290
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,295
Next and how

1291
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,831
In the home we've had

1292
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,855
A history of

1293
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,135
If you're super richer

1294
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,951
Well off that you had servants and

1295
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,743
Even now

1296
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,279
Dynamic

1297
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,559
Are digital assist

1298
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,375
Hector called assistance you tell them what to do

1299
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:16,191
And seemed to be that we shouldn't be developing to

1300
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,239
Schools that replicate that

1301
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,615
Yeah I think it's a really interesting and very dangerous Dynamics

1302
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,895
To constantly think of

1303
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:30,271
Technology services in the home space is being some kind of subservient entity

1304
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,343
The fact that most assistance it's not changing

1305
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,671
Women's names

1306
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,231
Now I saw this yesterday

1307
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:45,631
A smoke alarm sounds like a woman is more likely to or sounds like at someone's mother is more likely to wake up the kids

1308
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,655
There's this const

1309
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:52,543
Dealing with Automation in the home space in a way that

1310
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,103
Moves away from this idea of servitude

1311
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,639
Most people you know

1312
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:00,479
If they have Maids or cleaners who come in once a week or so they will

1313
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,783
Usually clean before the maid comes in

1314
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,831
Because they started feel so guilty about

1315
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
Using

1316
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,879
Someone else for their

1317
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:10,207
Ponies and part of this is because we live in

1318
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,023
Especially North America we live in home sitter

1319
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
Enormous

1320
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,607
Compared to the space that we used to have a hundred years ago

1321
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,167
Still have these tasks

1322
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,191
We feel need

1323
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,263
To be done at the United Pace that is incredible

1324
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,311
We have basically removed

1325
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,615
Most germs from

1326
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:33,247
Children's environments to the point where now we're actively encouraging parents to

1327
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,807
Make sure that their kids eat dirt somewhere and Beak

1328
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,831
Because otherwise it

1329
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:39,647
Immune system doesn't develop so we've

1330
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,695
Assertive overdone it on the home side

1331
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,743
And I think this idea of

1332
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,767
Having someone

1333
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,839
Help you do that is something that we probably should

1334
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,167
In terms of language in terms of application

1335
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,703
Maybe you can have

1336
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,775
A friend has something with you and that's a completely different

1337
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,543
Powerdyne

1338
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,335
Can having an assistant

1339
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:04,735
And it's also completely different Dynamic than having someone come into your home and help you do something

1340
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,295
Help and it's not necessarily

1341
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:10,367
Subservience you know a friend can help you your parents can have

1342
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,135
How to do something

1343
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:15,743
But somehow the language that we use commercially is still very tied to this idea

1344
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,279
Service and servitude

1345
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,351
If you compared to a hundred years ago well you know

1346
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,423
People have made some live-in maids and living Cooks

1347
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,447
But they also

1348
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:27,775
Cared for them and they were pay they were housed they were

1349
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,127
Unless you were superb

1350
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,407
Rich you actually usually

1351
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,967
See you later

1352
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,599
Buses to Downton Abbey Upstairs Downstairs

1353
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,135
Situation which was pretty

1354
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:50,559
Reserved for it was the elite and they actually were the ones who really didn't understand you took

1355
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,863
Allergies because electricity men's

1356
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,167
Especially Plumbing mint

1357
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:58,239
Wouldn't necessarily have a servant

1358
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,263
Bring water

1359
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,151
They just didn't get the point

1360
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:10,527
Would have a completely different facility operate yourself

1361
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,063
They're like this is a

1362
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,087
Downsizing of

1363
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,111
What I have now

1364
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,647
So they're not necessarily the best

1365
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,695
Look to for inspiration

1366
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,487
Got it okay

1367
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:22,559
Well the book is available in the US on

1368
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:26,143
Amazon it's called smarter homes how technology will change your whole life

1369
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:31,519
And it's also available in the UK from the a press.com website

1370
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:36,639
And it's 20 lb if you're in the UK and it's about $30 for the digital version

1371
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,407
In the US

1372
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:40,223
