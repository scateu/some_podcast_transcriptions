00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacy Higgins

2
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,336
Mathematics is your co-host

00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,152
And I'm going to let you know that

00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:21,760
Today Show is going to be packed full of exciting news and also some Home Improvement

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,040
On Kevin side

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:23,808
So

8
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,832
Not really

9
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:30,464
Smart Home Improvement although I do have a new Z-Wave lock on my front door replacing the front door as we speak right now

10
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,024
Rotted wood frames and whatnot but

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,304
Yeah

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
Sorry

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,120
So there may be a little background noise but

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,912
Bear with us because Kevin

15
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,704
All right

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
So here we go

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,032
Today we're going to talk about

18
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,824
Samsung's new

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,848
Voice assistant

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
We're going to talk about

21
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,456
I missed it by Google's voice assistant on the home

22
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,528
Tell me about the news about the Amazon Echo

23
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,296
And

24
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:00,672
Then we're moving out of the assistant territory we're going to talk about what happens to Zona

25
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,720
A company that was bought

26
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,768
It wasn't but we'll talk about it

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,400
And arm has some news they bought an NB iot company and they introduced a new architecture

28
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
So whoop whoop

29
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,704
And finally

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,008
Will end it with some SmartThings news

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,032
Because

32
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
All right

33
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,616
This week we have

34
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,432
An awesome sponsor in Samsung artik

35
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,712
We also have

36
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
Vint Cerf is Our Guest

37
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
Who

38
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,832
And I'm not saying that just be

39
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
Google Play

40
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,416
Yeah I kind of don't know what's causing

41
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
You know he's

42
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,024
She's one of the fathers of the internet he's also an evangelist from Google and

43
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584
He's the architect of the Matrix

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
There we go

45
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
That's what we'll

46
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
Alright so

47
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,448
Before you get to him

48
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,824
You got to go through us so let's get this show started with a message from this week sponsor

49
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,128
This week sponsor is Wolf SSL

50
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
The world's top five Industrial Automation companies

51
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
Floor devices to their power meters and they are not alone will pass Adele secures 2 billion connections across the

52
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
The multitude of iot sectors including Automotive connected home industrial military and medical devices

53
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
The Mirai botnet the growing threat of ransomware attacks on the Internet of Things companies have to pay attention to secure

54
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
Charity warpas litigation bad PR and their brand value securing the iot is hard but

55
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,528
What does a cell has experience in specialized expertise to help

56
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,648
Visit wolf ssl.com

57
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440
Okay

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,768
She'll get it started with things that talk

59
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,816
Bruce Sterling came on the show a couple weeks back

60
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
Did he call these talking

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,448
And I kind of like the name he's like

62
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
Ghetto his idea was that

63
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
They don't do much

64
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
I don't know if it was

65
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,360
They're stubborn

66
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
He called them talking

67
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,408
Chalky spray really did like the

68
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
The phrase

69
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
So

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
I don't know what do you think

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,344
I mean there's been a big push for voice assistants obviously since

72
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,184
Say sincere restarted although you feel all the way back to like

73
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
Windows

74
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,536
Cee days are pocket PC with Microsoft ad voice actor

75
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
Washington Pediatrics

76
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,400
At that time the tech wasn't there for natural language processing

77
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,752
You had to literally record yourself saying a command and then assign

78
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
A command to that

79
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
Recording

80
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
Canal days

81
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,384
Yeah those were the days all right

82
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:33,248
Yeah but now it's obviously much better because you have natural language processing week.

83
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,808
Siri we've got Google Assistant

84
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
You got

85
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,136
Echo devices letters lots of

86
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:43,744
Voice interface says I keep coming back to it being the invisible interface at something

87
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
Works for everybody

88
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
Buying large

89
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,144
Now Samsung wants to getting on the game although it's really

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,240
That's a second attempt because they already had S-Voice which was their version of a

91
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,312
Your phone assistant but now they've got

92
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
Bixby and

93
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,432
Bixby isn't quite what I expected it to be I don't know what you thought

94
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,760
But what did you think are you surprised by what Bixby is

95
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,368
I wasn't actually surprised because Bixby one I really like the name

96
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,184
It makes me think of like some friendly alien or something

97
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,720
Bixby or puppy

98
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
But

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143
What it does in kind of reminded me of which was

100
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
Created by the guys who actually did Siri

101
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,847
When you talk to the guys who created Viv they were thinking about building this kind of back-end infrastructure to help

102
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,639
Applications talk to each other

103
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,527
So having something that basically it kind of reminded me of Google Assistant

104
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
You could that ties things together

105
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
Hear your voice

106
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
Felt like it made a lot of sense to

107
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
Yes

108
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,511
It looks like it will do that it looks like it will also

109
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
Kind of

110
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,655
Take over some of the touchscreen interface of gotten used to over the last 10 years so that way

111
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
Anything you could do by

112
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,287
Touching a controller button on your phone or an app

113
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
Whatever might be

114
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,895
You should theoretically be able to do with Bixby via voice

115
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,223
So there's an interface aspect of it there's also what you would talk about

116
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
Which is the

117
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,343
Getting apps to talk to each other which I think developers will actually have to

118
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,183
Kind of an able but I don't have the same technical details yet

119
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,767
But it seems more interface e to me then

120
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
AI to me

121
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
I supposed

122
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
Sational

123
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,703
Contextual

124
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
Yeah I think

125
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,031
Meaning of assistant that does things

126
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,871
That or gets information contextual information right time right place

127
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:42,271
That's what I think of more often with assistant but you could also say assistant will help you interact with an app or apps

128
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
And it seems like

129
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
It's

130
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
Maybe a bit of both but I think more

131
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,623
More the latter

132
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
Yes

133
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,487
In that makes sense cuz that was the expertise they bought it wasn't

134
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,071
About like having a conversation in that way I mean

135
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
I think Google is

136
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,911
Probably the farthest to head on

137
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,727
The more conversational in assistant

138
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Level stop

139
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,335
But it doesn't have kind of the chops on the

140
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Controlling a variety of

141
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
Thanks site

142
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
That's her

143
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
So Samsung went the other way

144
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
We should know something

145
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
Casa

146
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Yes

147
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,791
Yes I don't work on the IRT team but I do work as a consultant for Android

148
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
Chrome Enterprise type things so yes

149
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,375
So my my opinions are my own

150
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Yes

151
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
And you know

152
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
He probably won't say anything

153
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Play nasty about

154
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Android Enterprise

155
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,359
Hopefully I won't say anything about it

156
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,919
Non-sequitur

157
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:48,319
All right so that's Samsung Bixby will find out more because it's next week that they're going to announce the

158
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
Air show at the phone

159
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,207
The alleged I said I can neither confirm nor deny

160
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,607
That's correct so Samsung is having an event might be multiple locations I do know that they're having an event in New York

161
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
City I think it's the 28th

162
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
Might be Wednesday of next week so

163
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
Unfortunately will be

164
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,823
Right around the time you record our weekly show so

165
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
What that may be put off

166
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
Talking about that till the following

167
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
Okay

168
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,063
So that's talking donkey number one

169
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,599
Talking donkey number two

170
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
Is the Amazon Echo

171
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Now is

172
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Final

173
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,327
And to be honest I mean we've already heard that some phones will have

174
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
Echo integration

175
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,447
Built in such as the Huawei maybe the mate

176
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
9 May 10th

177
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:44,383
That was enough CES I don't believe they've implemented that yet and I guess that's a take the place of Google Assistant will give you

178
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Options

179
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,503
But this is actually Amazon itself not a harbor partner Amazon itself saying hey

180
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
Replay

181
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,575
Echo smarts into your

182
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,183
Strange thing to me is they put it in the Amazon shopping app

183
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,791
Which makes sense if you want to track orders by voice or order things

184
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,887
But if you want general information like right before the show I used it to get the weather

185
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
And it works

186
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
Fine

187
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,775
But I had to go to the Amazon shopping app so why not just just have it in the app

188
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
That has her name

189
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,871
I have like a dozen Amazon apps on my phone

190
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
I have

191
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
Let's eat let's try calling or madam

192
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
So the day app

193
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,807
I have Amazon Kindle app

194
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
Stop the music app

195
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
The Now app

196
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
I think I have the shop

197
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
How is it going

198
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,023
Fastpitch bat actress

199
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
Wrong that's just wrong

200
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,143
Okay so I get I see where you're going

201
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
I get it

202
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:44,287
I have multiple Amazon apps as well just put in all the apps they're all going back to the same servers I'm in

203
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,359
You don't make it contextual in that I want to check

204
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
Shopping stuff via voice

205
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,431
Okay I'm going to go to the shopping

206
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,223
I want to control Smart

207
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Home things

208
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Voice

209
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,319
Put it into the one that does that

210
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
I mean

211
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
I want to control music

212
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
Through Amazon Prime music

213
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
Put it in the app that does

214
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,767
I don't understand why it's all in the shopping app

215
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
You seem silly to me

216
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
It no I'm with you

217
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,167
It's also very confusing

218
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,471
I don't I can't find it I don't have it so

219
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
If you're looking for this

220
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
Amazon shopping app which if you like me

221
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,591
Maybe you haven't downloaded it

222
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,919
Go download it so you can talk to

223
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
I'm kind of like

224
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Okay

225
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
Next up

226
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Google

227
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,135
Google this week actually may have been last week

228
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
On the Google home device

229
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
Had kind of a

230
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,327
Because it feels pretty intrusive what they did is as part of

231
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
People's daily briefing

232
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,935
That you can get that tells you you're like weather traffic

233
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Basically like your

234
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
Your morning radio kind of thing

235
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
On the Google home

236
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
They inserted

237
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
An ad for Beauty and the Beast

238
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
Yeah the new movie

239
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
What's

240
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,367
Really crazy is when someone called them about it cuz somebody posted it on Twitter

241
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,671
Google decided that it wasn't

242
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:13,119
Correct correct so you're right it was part of the my day feature which kind of summarizes everything for you whenever you ask

243
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
And it kind of

244
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,935
It went at the very end it was a

245
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
Literally

246
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
This is the tech

247
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
That was spoken

248
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,335
By the way Disney's live action Beauty and the Beast opens today

249
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,639
And if there's a little bit of information about the movie

250
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
I mean

251
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:32,063
I guess I see but I see both sides are clearly if I'm a user and I do not own a Google home at 4

252
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:37,183
Echoside that's the route I went for various reasons just better support of the products I use

253
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,487
It's going to sound like a nap without a doubt

254
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:44,863
Google says was intended to be an ad it was just trying to write some helpful information about your day and

255
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
Was kindly content

256
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
Yeah I mean

257
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,055
If it's not clear to the users then you got a question the decision to do it I think

258
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
Well

259
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
1

260
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
Baseline did money change

261
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
Don't know so nobody knows

262
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
Google has not said

263
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Disney has no

264
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
That's it

265
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,391
That's the first question right because the FTC

266
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Even

267
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
Even if users

268
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
Eventually the FTC would be like

269
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
What are you doing

270
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
But you

271
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,071
I think the shows a couple thing

272
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
Thanks one

273
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,447
It shows that dealing with ads in a voice assisted world

274
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
What is going to be

275
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
Really hairy

276
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
Annoy people

277
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
If it's not done well

278
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,663
But if it's done too well I think the FTC is going to be like

279
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
Did you really think you were serving

280
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Sponsored

281
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Kind of like they do

282
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Instagram

283
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,255
So there's that there's a very fine line there it needs to be clear to users

284
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,655
Weather as you said you know it's sponsored Penny changed hands basically is this an ad or is this not a nap

285
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
Write it needs to be clear to end users

286
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
And I will say that there are ways

287
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
I am sure you guys don't

288
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
The Harry Potter

289
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,663
Fantastic Beasts movie came out

290
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,479
Google actually did and I think it still works

291
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,271
You could say lumos

292
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
You can say hey G

293
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
Lumos

294
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
And your phone flashlight with

295
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
Right

296
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
That lumos by the

297
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,767
Not Harry Potter

298
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,423
Very clear we don't want people thinking they can actually do this

299
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
It's magic

300
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
But you can actually do it on your

301
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,847
I thought that was really fun it was clever

302
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,407
And I assumed money changed hands

303
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
I mean it felt kind of marks

304
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,271
Nothing but it felt like something a user opted into

305
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
Enby

306
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
I guess

307
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,135
Mostly they felt like something a user opted into

308
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
So I guess

309
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
That's the first

310
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,791
You Can Be Clever ads and I think we're going to have to see how that gets

311
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
It's done for

312
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
2

313
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,167
This I really think Google needs to think about

314
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
Switching from an ad based company

315
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
To a product

316
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
And I say this

317
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
Rather a services

318
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
And I say this because

319
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,223
Google's ad Revenue comes from the web

320
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
Predominantly

321
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
And we're going to stop looking so much at

322
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
And when it

323
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,951
Goes into a world where data matters and services matter

324
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
I think it should really start to position itself

325
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
Not as an ad

326
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
Because people don't trust

327
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:29,215
And you're not saying anything that many analysts haven't said in the past I mean that's

328
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Something that

329
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Not an original

330
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
I'm saying that

331
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
A lot of people agree

332
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,455
And the fact is as you said a lot of those

333
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,015
Ads come over the web and now

334
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,807
The web

335
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
It's bigger than just

336
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
Something in a browser

337
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,695
The data from the web is coming through devices

338
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,535
Through

339
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Wearable devices

340
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
Home assistant

341
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,447
Connected other bands I mean there's so many more places

342
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
That the web is touching

343
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Right

344
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,335
So now it becomes do you want to see ads on all those things

345
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
There's a whole mindset that needs to be

346
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
Figure it out here

347
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,199
Traditional old ad model

348
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,271
Will not work in a connected to a connected world with

349
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
Multiple screens or

350
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
Other interfaces such as voice

351
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,647
Yeah and having that data

352
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:24,511
Has-beens that could provide super super valuable services and

353
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,839
I guess maybe maybe the next step then is how to monetize

354
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
Ads for Beauty and the Beast at the end of

355
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
My day

356
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Is probably not the

357
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
Keep thinking

358
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,847
Okay let's move on

359
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
Wouldn't really quick

360
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Purple

361
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
We'll try this in audio category

362
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
A smart home

363
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
That was

364
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,135
Controlled by an Ocarina which is

365
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
That weird

366
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
How much is a pipe

367
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,767
Hey I guess it's an instrument

368
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:01,119
Yeah well doesn't this will have to be electronic I mean in in the Zelda games

369
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
Electronic butt

370
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,703
Sounds like they have electricity there

371
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
No no

372
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,287
So he basically created a smart home that was controlled by

373
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Ocarina

374
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,127
Because he has a huge Legend of Zelda fan

375
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
And he basically built

376
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
You put a microphone on a Raspberry Pi

377
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
How many plays in Ocarina certain

378
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
Sound phrases

379
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
Trigger certain things.

380
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,695
To happen with Wi-Fi control devices in his house he built all these himself so this is not something

381
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,487
Yeah you're not going to go buy this

382
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
But

383
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
How fun was that

384
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
And

385
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,863
Talk about it interesting parking app

386
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,167
Opportunity that actually what we're saying

387
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
What's Google +

388
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,007
Opportunities to tie into

389
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
Movies in

390
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
And products

391
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
With

392
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:47,455
Baby smart things at different commands and remember how when I got back from Harry Potter world and I was so sad that I could

393
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Can use my wand

394
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:54,879
Okay I was going to bring that up because they're to go there's a perfect do it yourself just pointed at certain smart

395
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,719
Home devices and have him go on and go off the lawn to know you could do that

396
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,559
I can't because it's the one has

397
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
It's not NFC

398
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
I think it's a

399
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
I already

400
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,471
I think it's

401
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
But it's proprietor

402
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
Cannabis

403
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
So so think about that marketing

404
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
There might be some fun to be had there

405
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
Alright let's talk about arm

406
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
Because there were two things

407
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,791
What has more relation to the iot than others

408
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:38,655
So last month arm acquired two companies that provide NBA

409
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Technology

410
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,727
For those of you guys are like

411
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,591
Is one of the low-power wide area network

412
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,687
Works so basically you can send small signals small amounts of data

413
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Over

414
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,735
Huge areas

415
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,319
Cool thing about NB iot is that it cellular

416
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:02,975
So the cellular companies are looking at this in AT&T Verizon orange it said

417
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,535
Everybody's looking at this to provide like

418
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
Put your sensors in your smoke detectors talk to the cellular

419
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
But it's cheaper

420
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,519
Your mentioning cellular have they changed the name of nb-iot 2

421
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
How to say LTE

422
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
Andy one

423
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
Oh so there's two

424
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Two versions

425
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,479
Of course they're Hispanic

426
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,527
And then herself

427
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
Cat 1

428
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
Okay

429
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,367
Nb-iot

430
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,719
Is the download speeds are 250 km per sec

431
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
I'm in Uplink is

432
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
Also too

433
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
Until it's y'all

434
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
Very very

435
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
Very small like it'll tell your device state or something like that I mean if they were talking small bits of information

436
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
It's on us

437
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
It really love how

438
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,919
An LTE cat M1

439
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Is

440
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
1 megabit per second

441
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
So that's

442
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,367
It's not video but maybe it's something a little bit more steady state

443
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
BiggerPockets

444
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
More price

445
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:10,047
Little bit different they're both incredibly low power both designed to go over wide areas

446
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
Both going to be implement

447
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,607
Bike carriers

448
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
And we're still waiting for pricing form

449
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
AT&T and Verizon

450
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
For both of these

451
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Scratch

452
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,823
Set alarm purchased two companies then

453
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Two companies

454
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
They are

455
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Next

456
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
G

457
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Cam

458
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
They do

459
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
NBA

460
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Coyote

461
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Software

462
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
And

463
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
Missed base

464
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
Which does the actual chip

465
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
The physical layer so

466
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
The lowest part in the stack

467
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
What does the radio stuff

468
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,071
Together these two basically give arm

469
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,887
The ability to design in NB iot

470
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
This matters

471
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Because

472
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,799
There's also a bunch of other stand standards out there in the low-power wide area network

473
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,103
World which like Laura

474
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,407
We talked about all the time on the show

475
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
There's things like sick Fox

476
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
And there's other

477
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,551
Proprietary things like ingenue

478
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,111
I think wait list is still floating around out there

479
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
The idea here is

480
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:15,583
Nb-iot that the back of the cellular carriers if they come up with a business model it looks like arm is like yeah we're going to support that

481
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
I was just going to say me nothing against the

482
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,215
Competing standards and product makers but

483
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,007
Arm already has such a big

484
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:27,359
Footprint in the mobile industry's got the backing of practically everybody

485
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
If anybody can push towards

486
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,223
Fewer standards I would think it would be an arm

487
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
You know there's other

488
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
Big news

489
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
But I think it's fake

490
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,255
What time it is

491
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
Dynamic

492
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
And that's like

493
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
Got super

494
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,863
The last IQ

495
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
The last

496
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,959
Yeah the last two letters

497
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,031
Know the last two letters of the word dynamic and they're brand new

498
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
IQ

499
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
And there

500
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,175
Basically they're saying it's Works painting possibilities for artificial intelligence

501
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,527
Tell me why you think this is a big deal maybe you'll convince me

502
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
Okay so

503
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,903
What they done here is arm has actually changed its architecture

504
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
So

505
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
They have

506
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,767
Redesigned the way they're going to make their

507
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
Cortex a core

508
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,607
These are their bigger fatter meteor

509
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,423
Chords for smartphones for performance

510
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,471
Not the M class which is what

511
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,079
Shut all that stuff aside

512
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,103
Sha

513
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,639
So what they done

514
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
When is

515
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:37,503
The architecture they chosen is going to let you run eight different

516
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,295
Horse in a cluster

517
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
That are all going to be able to run at 2

518
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,647
Clock speed so different frequency

519
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
So you can have one that's like

520
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,511
Super high-power like 1.2 gigahertz going

521
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:53,119
Chugging full out then you can have one you know what 500 gigahertz that's like

522
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,655
Only waking up till late

523
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
Listen for a voice

524
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959
Anderson

525
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,543
Alright so I'm gonna stop you there and ask a question

526
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,127
To me it does not seem very different from their

527
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,455
Big little architecture and they already had

528
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:11,807
Multiple corre processes running at different speeds

529
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,111
So big little was introduced in

530
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
2011 that was there last

531
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
Forehead what that does is

532
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
Impaired

533
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
A big core

534
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
Like the massive

535
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
Powerful one with a

536
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,632
Metalcore

537
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
Less powerful

538
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,984
The big core wood handle like mobile phones and stuff like that

539
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,056
So the difference here is in this feels very slight

540
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
Is

541
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,664
With big little you had one that was on or off

542
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
And the other

543
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,528
It was on or off but you couldn't choose like different frequencies for

544
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,880
Taken throttle them based on the performance load required

545
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,928
And also you can only put four of them in

546
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
And

547
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,024
You can individualize

548
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
Every single one

549
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,840
So do you guys have all

550
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
A little

551
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
So

552
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,752
I think the the cores in the cortex is now.

553
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
2

554
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
Throttle

555
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,336
Based on performance load

556
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
I could be wrong

557
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
I'll give you some more

558
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,224
Cuz now we're getting home

559
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,832
So are you didn't actually give a whole lot of technical

560
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,952
We're going to see that later when they actually introduce a new cortex design

561
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,232
With this Ark

562
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
Temperature later this year

563
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
They also did two more things

564
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
Mentioning

565
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,936
Changed it so

566
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,472
The bus now works

567
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,264
An accelerator

568
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Much faster

569
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,848
And they also added some

570
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:44,224
And this is real nebulous are like some resiliency thing so it works for automotive in robotics

571
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,296
And I don't know if you remember they actually introduced a core

572
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
Last year

573
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,392
A core I think was a 57 or they 53

574
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,232
That was more resilient in design for these kind of industrial

575
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
Situation

576
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,072
But they're also changing the instruction set

577
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:05,728
And this gets into the AI stuff they're adding some instructions to the instruction set to make it work better for

578
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
Intelligence

579
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,824
That is the final amount of excretion

580
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:14,176
This was more of a press release in a product launch sandwich

581
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
It's fine I had no issue with that

582
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,064
They just seems very evolutionary to me in that

583
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,136
As we said big little architecture which was a big step forward

584
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,696
Back in 2011 this just seems like

585
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
Again maybe a half step forward on that

586
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
Andrea Lee

587
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:36,192
It's yes there are new instruction sets that will help with a I I don't know what those instructions will be in and what they will bring us

588
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
Sweet we'll see

589
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,872
I mean it's almost like we're taking our old architecture to adjust a little bit and say Nathan is Rai

590
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,432
I'm just not I guess I'll wait and see

591
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,968
What Hardware

592
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
Manufacturers do with this

593
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:54,112
Just to see how much of a big deal is really is but it again it seems very evolutionary to me

594
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,160
This will end up more in phones

595
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
It does feel kind of Apple

596
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,744
I can see why you think that

597
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,560
I think we'll see it first in phones

598
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,888
Because you can actually dedicate a lot of tasks to specific

599
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,424
Processors in a way that

600
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
I think would be compelling

601
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,288
The other thing it'll be good for is

602
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
Networking

603
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,384
On the other networking site cuz you could really amp up your

604
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,248
Networking in because you're dealing with so much for so many more flows of information

605
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
We're going to see

606
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,832
The accelerator side of that also come

607
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
That is the arm

608
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
Wait and see

609
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:36,608
Text hubby and we'll move on from the deeply nerdy to the

610
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,144
Deeply sad

611
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
All right

612
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Last week

613
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
I broke a story

614
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,544
I'm Zana which is the company that

615
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,616
Does software integration for lots of other companies

616
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,176
Including the Staples connect home that is now the phone

617
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,248
The song FeFe Tacoma home

618
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,296
Automation stuff

619
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
Several Lake

620
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
Common products

621
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
So

622
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
Zana

623
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,952
I had heard that they've been for sale

624
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,744
For a little while and

625
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:10,656
Basically at a deal had fallen through Honeywell was one of the potential requires that they were in talks with and and that

626
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,680
That did not happen

627
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
But

628
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,776
After a deal to buy them fell through

629
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,360
Ring the maker of a connected doorbell basically said

630
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,456
Will extend everyone who works it's on us

631
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,040
And most everybody is on olfaction

632
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,368
Kittens on us former CEO Mike Harris

633
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,672
Has confirmed to me that he is now a

634
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
Head of the

635
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,256
Ring Philadelphia office

636
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
Which

637
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,816
Now exist

638
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:46,240
Enough was in my backyard in Malvern if I recall correctly

639
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
Pennsylvania

640
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:54,688
Oh so is that where the ring Philadelphia office is at sitsa Philadelphia suburb that's why

641
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
It just

642
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Exist

643
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,064
There might

644
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,856
Presumably right now

645
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,392
For the 80

646
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,464
Or so the 70 to 80s on us employees that are now

647
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
Every

648
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,072
So really interesting story

649
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:17,472
Really cool that ring came in and offer these people jobs and really cool that they all wanted to stay together and take it

650
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
Because you know

651
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,824
People who understand device integration which is what saint of does

652
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
It's actually a pretty valuable skill right now

653
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,456
They could have found jobs elsewhere

654
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,760
And so this feels like

655
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,808
Good news for ring

656
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
And

657
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
The people who used to work at sauna

658
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
My big question is

659
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,464
What happened

660
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
Tazanna which is what I don't know

661
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
I feel like

662
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,376
There still an asset out there they still have products like sawed-off was

663
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:49,472
Still supporting all of the people who still have Staples connect devices

664
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,336
No one comes on off no one from its investors

665
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
Has called me

666
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,688
Dark rather I called them and they haven't returned any of my calls

667
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,528
I don't actually know what happens to those customers that

668
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,064
ReliOn sign up support

669
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,464
That's a good question and as the mean as you alluded to the Staples home connectors got into Funk so in those people

670
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,280
Already in the Lurch I don't know what's really going on there

671
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,936
Indiana will they continue to do that that's going to be up to ring I suppose

672
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
I know it'll be up to Zana

673
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
Ring only hired

674
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:30,176
So who's left the question to actually make those decisions

675
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
Xander support these things

676
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,736
So everyone

677
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,760
Asana

678
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
Got a job

679
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,856
So who's left at Solana

680
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,208
What's left is that of might be the right question

681
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
Now not everybody took

682
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,048
Looks like everybody

683
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,608
The people who didn't aren't working at Sonic

684
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,264
I've been trolling Pacer to find out if there has been a bankruptcy

685
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
So we'll see

686
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:02,176
That is an open question if any of you guys want to tell us what's happening feel free to

687
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,712
To drop us a line Casino

688
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,760
I used to love the Staples today

689
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,064
I thought it was the best home hub out there

690
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
For a really long time

691
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Because

692
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
It was user-friendly

693
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,952
It had a lot of Integrations

694
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
Interesting

695
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:21,376
I like the display because the display showing all the products that Staples actually had put together through TV is on off

696
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:26,496
Because it showed people how these things interact in a very simple to understand way

697
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,056
So there's that

698
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Finally

699
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,872
Two bits of things for smart

700
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
1

701
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,480
If you guys have gone in your SmartThings app lately

702
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,528
Or if you're a new buyer

703
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Perhaps

704
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,368
Discovery now is amazing

705
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,416
It just goes through your house

706
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Echo Steakhouse

707
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,864
It goes on your Wi-Fi not working it basically Auto discovers anything on your Wi-Fi network

708
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,656
Which for me was a lot of stuff

709
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,704
Including my Sonos is

710
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
Or is it so nice

711
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
So it discovered all of that

712
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,688
It discovered

713
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,480
A bunch of stuff it was really nice

714
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
So

715
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,296
Discovery is way better at it that's a brand new

716
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
And

717
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,904
I finally got my SmartThings and Lutron Thing 2

718
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
Work and I have to tell you

719
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
That

720
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,000
I apparently was the only one who had

721
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Problems

722
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,096
And it was not because of SmartThings it was because

723
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
I had a ghost Lutron hub

724
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
On my network

725
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,960
I know

726
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,544
Solutran benezra like why do you have two Bridges I was like I don't have to

727
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,616
A Darkness you do

728
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,176
Here's what I think happened

729
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
It's because

730
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:44,576
I actually discovered that I have a phantom will call it a phantom Logitech Harmony Hub

731
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
I'm a phantom Nest Thermostat

732
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,280
So I was like as I discovered all of these weird Phantom things in my accounts

733
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,864
I thought it might have to do with the fact that I took my Wi-Fi network

734
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
Offline

735
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,656
And

736
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,216
To test some new Wi-Fi networks in

737
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
Then I brought it back on

738
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
And so I'm wondering if

739
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,896
That process created

740
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
Alternative

741
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
Bridges

742
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,992
I have no idea how all these came about

743
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,528
The companies themselves.

744
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
How old is

745
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,672
So this this emphasizes how weird my house

746
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
Now that I've tried to smart thing

747
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
I can tell you that it is awesome

748
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,352
It is a cloud the cloud

749
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,144
Integration and I was actually really worried about that

750
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704
I don't know what magic

751
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,520
Blackmagic Lutron and SmartThings have done but

752
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,056
There is not

753
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
Noticeable

754
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
Latency

755
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
In commanding

756
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
My stuff

757
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
From the app

758
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
Through Google home

759
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
And through the Amazon Echo

760
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
All of those work

761
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,392
Seemingly at the same speed maybe a millisecond slower

762
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
But not so you

763
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,024
Interesting that you mention latency because I didn't

764
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,888
Say I was going to do some of that show but I did do this between the last showing out I

765
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,680
Got a wink Hub 2

766
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:08,032
And I noticed much less latency which is very good

767
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:12,896
Nope Anthem devices rounds afraid that when I transfer all my stuff from the one to the other

768
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,688
Create issues

769
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
Oh yeah that way

770
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,296
So what are you going to do with your old wink

771
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,832
Cuz I have a wink 1 and I don't know what

772
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:25,696
I have a teammate out in Mountain View who wants to know

773
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,744
Smarthomes I'm like hell just send you a link

774
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,144
Send somebody awake

775
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,680
Go for it

776
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
I have a spare wink hub

777
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,264
Okay we're going to do this for a week

778
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:43,104
Send me an email at info at ioc podcast.com

779
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,640
And

780
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
I got a bunch

781
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:50,784
I will do a random generator or I will randomly pick one of y'all and you can have my old

782
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,576
This is Wings version one hub

783
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
So if you want it

784
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,392
Send me an email

785
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,928
And will

786
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,488
Do it before the next show so

787
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
Actually let's say

788
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,304
Before the end of the day on

789
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,328
Monday night

790
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,120
Which is March

791
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
27

792
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
And then

793
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
U2

794
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
Could have a wink one

795
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,264
That feels good

796
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,824
Let's do the guest

797
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,128
Kevin thank you

798
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664
Everyone else

799
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:22,528
Stay tuned for Vint Cerf talking about what the problems are with

800
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,064
The Internet of Things

801
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,600
And how he thinks that's going to work out

802
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,440
But first a message from our sponsor

803
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:33,280
Everyone we are taking a break for The Internet of Things podcast

804
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:37,376
For a message from our sponsor this week sponsors Samsung art

805
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
And I have syrupy chair

806
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,216
Samsung

807
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,288
What Samsung is doing

808
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:50,944
Hi Sarah ICC I'm so glad you're here today so can you tell me what Samsung

809
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,344
In the industrial internet let me start by saying that Samsung is a very large manufacturer

810
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,464
Connected products today a lot of people know Samsung through the mobile phone to tablet

811
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,024
Wearables and many more connected products

812
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,328
Samsung video

813
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:11,680
Chasing and understanding a lot of the challenges that other manufacturers have

814
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,752
Trying to improve off by guillotine for json downtime

815
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,824
And deliver reading high quality connect

816
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,128
Json pretty demanding customers

817
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,176
Samsung manufacturer

818
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:26,016
And with all Arctic iot platform we're helping

819
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,576
Manufacturers like Samsung to get better

820
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,624
Insights into that productivity

821
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,672
Boca helping industrial OEM

822
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,720
To deliver connected products

823
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,768
And connected services

824
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,560
Awesome see you

825
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:42,400
Perspective what is the future of manufacturing

826
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,960
Countries already created

827
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:50,848
Massive quantities of data so that's not something that's new I think the s*** that we going to see is more in the usage

828
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,408
All that data

829
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,480
Pink shed more effectively between applications

830
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,832
Beautiful and also shared with other parties to have outside

831
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,856
The factory

832
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:08,256
Medieval efficiencies that haven't been delivered yet and also we going to see that day to being shown or delay

833
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,816
David down to the machines or to the people

834
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:14,656
Really need it and they're going to be getting that dates of when they need it most

835
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:20,032
So what are some common mistakes that you see people making is they try to add intelligence to their face

836
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,848
I think one challenge

837
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:28,992
Industrial iot implementation to security it's always a big concern or industrial customers

838
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,576
And it's important to design that security in from the outfit

839
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,136
Rather than added in as an afterthought

840
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,672
Security is a big issue

841
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,000
Also a graphic shifts that make automation

842
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
Manufacturing

843
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:48,192
In the manufacturing and production for teaching in the US says there a lot of very highly skilled and experienced workers who going to

844
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,728
I'll be retiring this problem

845
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:53,824
Patisserie challenging for petroleum Engineers of the utility worker

846
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,848
Big fraction

847
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,152
What does what forces are going to be retiring

848
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,432
In the next 5 years

849
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,248
And with that big of a cold

850
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
Great shift change

851
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,320
We potentially going to lose a lawsuit

852
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,112
Intelligence and knowledge

853
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:11,744
Expertise in industrial processes so we need to find ways of capturing this expertise

854
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,304
And one way to approach it is to

855
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,424
Collect more data and analyze that data more effectively to try and codify some of this knowledge

856
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,984
To find out more about Samsung

857
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
Arctic

858
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,104
And how it can help your iot development strategy

859
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,896
Go2www

860
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176

867
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:50,400
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacy Higgins

868
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,216
Bottom and today I have with me Vint Cerf want to be

869
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,264
What is called the father of the internet

870
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,568
One of the fathers of the internet here with me

871
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,360
So - are you doing

872
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,432
Well right now I'm absorbing Austin reign

873
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
Unexpectedly

874
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:08,576
It always rains during South by at least one day before it turns beautiful again

875
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:13,440
That case I don't feel like anybody dumped on me but it's a pleasure to chat with you today

876
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,256
It is wonderful to talk to you I'm really excited

877
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,024
So

878
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
Let's just get it started with

879
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,352
How do you define The Internet of Things

880
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,912
I think that the most Broad

881
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,984
Is generalization would be anything that's programmable

882
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,264
And perhaps something with

883
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,312
Also has communication capability

884
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:35,968
This extends well beyond the classic sorts of appliances around the house and around the office

885
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,272
Sir in the car or on your person

886
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,064
I even think of

887
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,464
Fast training systems on the stock exchange is it kind of Internet of things as piece of software that takes real-world input

888
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,560
Juice it up for a while and then does something which has a real-world effect

889
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:59,520
So I'm very general notion of communicating software that that takes in real-world information in

890
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
Has an effect on the real world

891
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,616
For most people whoever is a device

892
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,896
Programmable

893
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,200
All right

894
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
And

895
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,784
Why would you say that this is a big deal

896
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,808
Right now forever

897
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,880
But perhaps the biggest deal about the Internet of Things

898
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,952
Is that our people are rushing to build

899
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
Products

900
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
They have these

901
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,304
Characteristics Communication in computation

902
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
Kobe mentality

903
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,984
The trouble is you're not paying as much attention to access control security privacy safe

904
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,568
And frankly autonomy by which I mean

905
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:39,968
Ability to operate successfully even if the Internet isn't available that what you don't want is your house doesn't work at

906
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,248
The Internet isn't connected

907
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,296
That would not be a good design

908
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
But already have

909
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,136
Sense to me on a daily basis with my internet

910
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
Flips out

911
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
So

912
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,720
What's actually skip to architecture

913
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,024
What kind of underlying technology

914
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
Do you think we need to

915
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
To think about

916
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,096
4

917
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,400
I guess scaling out this distributed

918
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
Intelligent Network

919
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,520
Well first of all there has been and I would say

920
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,544
Anna parents

921
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
Common

922
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,128
Choice to use the Internet Protocol is

923
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,408
Circle fundamental

924
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,200
Mechanism for moving database

925
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
Back and forth

926
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
IP version 6

927
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
Is preferable because it is

928
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
Scam

929
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:21,440
But the underlying transmission systems could vary all over the rod and they do to slow pan

930
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,976
Why fine

931
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:29,376
LTE not you can rattle off lights in Germany's Bluetooth and Bluetooth low energy so we're going to see a proliferation

932
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Variation

933
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,240
In the underlying transport mechanism and that's okay cuz the IP protocol

934
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
Amor

935
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,848
Critical question is what happens above the IP layer

936
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:43,968
And here we also see a lot of variation among the producers

937
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
These devices

938
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,344
And we're probably going to see that variation for a while to come

939
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,416
I think it's important to achieve some standard

940
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,744
Especially when we get up into the space of semantics

941
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,328
What can I tell what device what can the device tell me

942
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
If I have to

943
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:04,704
Somehow managing Ensemble of devices that come from multiple

944
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
Manufacturer is more

945
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
Brands

946
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,312
Standardization is your friend here

947
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,616
Because then you can write applications that

948
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
Consistent

949
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:16,992
If you have to write something different for every possible manufacturer

950
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:21,344
Equipment is going to be hard fixing things that don't work is going to be

951
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,136
Speaking of which

952
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:27,232
Another big challenge is how long these devices are going to be in the field

953
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,536
How long will they be maintainable

954
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:34,144
Will the companies that made them go out of business and leave you with a house that doesn't work anymore

955
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:40,800
What if there's a bug in the software that causes a your malfunction or a breach of privacy or some other thing

956
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,336
Who's going to fix that

957
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,640
How will the software get downloaded into the

958
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:51,040
Did you buy sell the device novocaine from a legitimate Source how do we know if the update hasn't been modified

959
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,320
Integrity

960
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,112
The list of questions

961
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,648
Is very long

962
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,792
And most people who are doing these devices are not thinking so much about that they're thinking about I have an app

963
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,840
And I have a device and that's it

964
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,864
End of story

965
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,216
And at some point even the consumers are going to recognize that there is more meat

966
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,288
So right now at the kind of

967
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,080
Device Communications level

968
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,128
Upstanders like iotivity

969
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,176
We should all join now we have

970
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,968
Got. So that's that layer

971
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,504
Some of the other thing

972
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784
Things that you were talking about

973
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,856
We really don't have a standard zeffert around them to

974
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
To my knowledge and I

975
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,648
I'm thinking of things like

976
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,232
I guess authentication of a device all the way through the network or even

977
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,280
Being able to monitor changes

978
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,840
Do we have anything like that on the internet

979
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,144
Not anything that's so so so

980
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,936
Pacific to the device

981
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,496
I think advice should be

982
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,776
Paranoid gently

983
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:48,384
Not accepting control or updates or willingness to release

984
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,944
Software release date

985
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:57,600
Unless it has good reason to believe that the party that is asking it for the data or commanding it to do something is

986
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,624
Legitimate

987
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:03,232
Which means probably in almost certainly some kind of cryptographic Exchange

988
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,536
Digital signature style thing

989
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:10,144
It has to be workout but then that leads to all kinds of questions about how easy or hard is it

990
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,936
Configure the device to do that

991
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,216
I worry about

992
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,776
Scenarios like I have a house full of this stuff

993
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,568
And I've invited guests over

994
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,640
How long does it take me to introduce my gas to the house

995
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,200
And give the gas the authority to

996
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,992
Turn the lights off and on and flush the toilet

997
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,904
And then when they leave how do I make sure that I revoke the privilege is so that the fifteen-year-old in the family doesn't do something

998
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,744
So there are these scenarios

999
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,792
I think you're not adequately

1000
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
Address

1001
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,584
We don't have

1002
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,912
Not coming agreement see at the even that these are the right problems

1003
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,960
Solve it alone how to solve them

1004
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,312
So my guess is going to be chaotic

1005
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,080
For a while

1006
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,151
But the consumers eventually are going to get

1007
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:56,991
The point that they don't want equipment in the house that isn't reliable

1008
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,783
Did they don't consider it

1009
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,551
To be safe

1010
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:03,647
That fails to work at the Internet isn't available in the old series

1011
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
Expectations

1012
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:09,791
Will eventually rise to the surface and either the producers

1013
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,071
Will have to respond

1014
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,119
Or their products won't be

1015
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,167
Purchased and they will go out of business

1016
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
So

1017
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,239
There will be pressure in the long night

1018
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:24,127
To solve the problems you achieve standards and everything else but not before a fair amount of turmoil

1019
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,151
Experience

1020
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
What is everything didn't talk

1021
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,479
2B internet

1022
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,295
What is each house had its own internet

1023
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,319
And then

1024
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
Your platform

1025
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,367
Provider let it out

1026
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,183
And did something like that does that feel like a viable solution

1027
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,975
It's not an open web thing

1028
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:44,095
I think it depends a great deal on what it is you were expecting this

1029
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,119
Classify

1030
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:51,519
To do I mean if you want remote monitoring for example when you're away and you want to be apprised of what's going on

1031
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,311
Turn around in an emergency

1032
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:59,711
The house is on fire the fire departments on the way should they have access to the webcams and the temperature sensors

1033
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
In order to

1034
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:04,831
Find people who have collapsed or places where the fire is obviously burning

1035
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
The brightest

1036
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,903
And then you don't want them to have access app

1037
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,183
The fire is out in summer

1038
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
So I can understand

1039
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,791
Local communication which I think is needed

1040
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:20,447
You don't want to have to go all the way out to the public internet and back again in order to control the house so they're Cleveland

1041
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
I need to be an internal

1042
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,519
Communications capability

1043
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,591
And that introduces the possibility of a hoverboard

1044
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,615
Control over something

1045
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,687
There's an organization that's called iotx

1046
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,223
Which is trying to help people

1047
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
The disparities

1048
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,527
Protocol

1049
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:41,183
Find a way to allow interaction to happen anyhow maybe with protocol translation which everybody gags at including

1050
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,487
Me or with some other mechanism

1051
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,511
So that

1052
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:49,119
Even in the presence of all the diversity it's possible to organize things in a

1053
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
Maura West

1054
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
Consistent

1055
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
At somewhere

1056
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
In the Arctic

1057
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:59,871
So I don't think that isolating things in the house exclusively it does salt

1058
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:03,199
The problem and certainly doesn't satisfy many people's expectation

1059
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,223
What this can do

1060
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,039
What about the industrial iot

1061
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,599
How should I think about that differently than

1062
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,623
Make it the Smart Home

1063
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:16,511
Well several things occurred to me one of them is it in an in an industrial setting you may have

1064
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,535
Tens of thousands

1065
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,559
Devices

1066
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:24,959
But you're operating at a scale where you presumably can have expertise in the company or accessible

1067
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:28,543
The company that can help organize configuring maintaining update

1068
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:32,895
You also could have some discipline within the organization about access

1069
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:37,247
You might insist on two-factor authentication really times a mechanism

1070
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,807
That limit the potential hazards

1071
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
Abuse

1072
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
Or invasion

1073
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,391
Of the system

1074
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:48,767
And so it's the usual thing in an in a corporate setting in a government setting in an inch

1075
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,327
Situational setting mothers in top-down control

1076
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,631
You may be able to and introduce

1077
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
Practices

1078
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,727
That makes system a lot more safe and secure

1079
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,519
In a household setting though

1080
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:05,663
It's another story because we're ordinary Mortals and we're not very disciplined and so the system has to help us

1081
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:09,759
Behave better or at least prevent our Worst Behavior from damaging

1082
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
Ourselves

1083
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
Arlington

1084
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,623
It's true sometimes I use the same

1085
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
Change password

1086
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:19,743
Two apps and I feel every time I'm like that's the wrong thing

1087
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
Okay

1088
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:21,791
So

1089
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,607
This is felt a little not dark but just hard

1090
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:30,751
Let's talk about what makes this worth it so what are the opportunities what is this really enable

1091
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,799
So there are several things that I am

1092
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:39,199
Firmly convinced will make a big difference the first one and obvious one is that with the right kinds of equipment in

1093
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,479
Monitoring and sensing

1094
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:47,135
You could do a better job of energy use and other resources in a house or in an office building and you see

1095
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,439
GED and I'll lead buildings

1096
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,487
Are getting more and more popular these days

1097
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:56,095
Probably because there's some tax advantages and other things about investing

1098
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,887
In this kind of structure

1099
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,167
So at home

1100
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,191
You may save money

1101
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,727
On your resources bills

1102
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,287
Another possibility is remote monitoring

1103
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,311
For safety

1104
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:10,687
Here we get into whether it's Access Control security or fire prevention or fire detection

1105
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,271
The third possibility which is perhaps a bit more in

1106
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:20,671
Is that tell you may be able to use it home which has been outfitted with this capability

1107
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,951
How do you monitor your angel

1108
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,559
And here we got the notion of continuous monitoring where the information

1109
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
Where

1110
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:35,007
An estimate can be made of your normal condition so that if you drift away from normal that can be a signal

1111
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
You should go

1112
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,639
Go to the doctor call husband Larry call 911 or do something

1113
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,687
So take your vitamin pill

1114
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:48,575
So this idea of being able to gather information and assemble it and make it useful

1115
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,903
Even to the extent of your own health is it is valuable

1116
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,231
I often wonder whether or not

1117
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,047
Having the house is fully instrumental

1118
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,119
Can also make it a lot more comfortable on adaptable

1119
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,191
There are lots of attempts now meme

1120
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,727
Voice interaction

1121
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:12,639
To control my house some of it is almost certainly as stimulated by one Star Trek episodes where you could say

1122
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,199
Malaysian play Beethoven

1123
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,735
I am

1124
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:22,367
Still a little unsure about how successful The Voice interactions are going to be but some of the applications

1125
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:29,535
I am being able to get the house to adapt to your preferences in an easy way it's supposed to running around pooping

1126
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,071
Ip65 dimmer switch

1127
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,375
It has a certain amount of appeal to it

1128
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,167
It is totally awesome

1129
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,447
I have many

1130
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,727
Voice settings better

1131
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,495
Like party mode

1132
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,775
Dinner mode

1133
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,543
So

1134
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,823
We talked a lot about

1135
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,871
Cool things that happened

1136
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,151
Standards in architecture

1137
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,687
Let's talk about

1138
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:52,575
How we're going to pull this together in a way that works for the consumer and the possibility of Regulation

1139
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
Because

1140
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,391
There's a lot of data running around

1141
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Security issue

1142
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
What role

1143
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,487
Should the government play

1144
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,023
In this whole Realm

1145
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:05,119
Well Chris the normal reaction in the private sector is the government

1146
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
Go away

1147
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,935
I think that's not going to be

1148
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,703
Possible

1149
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,727
To sustain

1150
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,335
People are going to be relying increasingly on these devices. Where

1151
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,431
At some point they're going to have to be some kind of certifications

1152
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,479
The software level on the hardware

1153
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,247
So we need

1154
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,783
Cyber Underwriters lab

1155
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:29,951
I think that there may also be potential liabilities associated with negligence

1156
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
Deployment

1157
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,999
Equipment

1158
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
Breakfast

1159
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:37,119
For example the situation that Gaming Corporation found itself in

1160
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:41,983
When whatever was a half-a-million webcams were all aimed at the same destination

1161
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:48,895
How could this possibly happen while there wasn't any access control built into the devices or the access control was widely known

1162
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,967
Username and passwords were constant in the same everywhere

1163
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,527
To assembling a botnet was no big deal

1164
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,831
I consider that to be near your responsible

1165
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:03,487
However to be fair to everybody people made those things probably weren't thinking about the possibility that they were all online

1166
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,791
The same time on the internet and therefore

1167
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,071
Compromisable

1168
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,863
And we saw what happened

1169
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
So just go

1170
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,679
Seat belts

1171
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:18,847
Warren until the law said if we catch you driving now to seatbelt over there's an accident without a seatbelt there will be time

1172
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,895
Same as smoking

1173
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:24,479
So you find all the Persuasions about good behavior

1174
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:27,039
Are backed up by some kind of incentive

1175
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:31,903
And I want to use the word incentive here and not necessarily legislation and regulation

1176
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,951
When we have incentives

1177
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,975
To do the right thing

1178
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,255
Then

1179
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,303
Generally speaking the right thing happens

1180
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:44,703
The question is how do we formulate the incentives in order to get that to happen and how do we agree on what the right thing is

1181
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,751
I thought you were going to tell me

1182
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,823
One of the other things

1183
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,871
I think it's worth considering here

1184
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:52,895
Is

1185
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:57,247
Those cameras many of them were manufactured in China so even if we had

1186
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,271
The right incentive

1187
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:03,391
People in China they don't have necessarily so there's an internationalisation

1188
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,951
I don't know what to think about it

1189
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:10,047
Well there have been a lot of discussions about International cyber

1190
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,071
Agreements

1191
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:15,935
On one side you agree not to attack each other's basic infrastructure and on the other

1192
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,495
Not to ship you know hazardous gear

1193
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:23,103
A couple of thoughts come to mind one of them is the the certification question

1194
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,639
I actually have some

1195
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:29,503
Saline Ciara suppose you couldn't sell a product unless you could at least reveal the source code

1196
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,551
Some party who agrees

1197
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,623
Private boat so handsy

1198
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:41,023
But Sadie credibility to have said we ran into a series of tests we did and everything else we believe this

1199
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,047
This device to me

1200
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
Say

1201
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,119
Another observation is to

1202
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:50,239
Inhibit the device's ability to communicate outside of the of the house except

1203
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:54,335
This gets back to you earlier thought about today

1204
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,663
A local conductivity that doesn't extend outside the house

1205
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,735
So I think that there are are serious

1206
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,015
Supply chain question

1207
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:08,927
That arise an example of a scenario that really worries me is somebody building a device throwing in random pieces

1208
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,975
Source operating system

1209
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,743
Code

1210
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:17,119
And not particularly caring about whether you'll ever be maintained or not just I just want to sell the device

1211
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:23,007
Answer that leaves another open question in my mind about commitments to maintaining

1212
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:28,895
These kinds of devices over. Of time cuz some people will buy them with the expectation that they're going to work for

1213
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,431
Period of a decade or more

1214
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,991
And what is the company goes out of business

1215
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,087
You know within six months because it wasn't the popular product and yet you want

1216
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
To keep it in use it

1217
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,415
So maybe they're asking Arrangements

1218
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,207
With regard to the source code

1219
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,023
There I think there's room for quite a bit

1220
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,863
Domestic and potentially International exploration

1221
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,655
Of agreements

1222
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,959
The United States because of his

1223
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,239
Extraordinary

1224
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,775
Consuming power

1225
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:59,103
Isn't it is a place where they will be even

1226
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,431
Higher risk factors just because we acquire all this stuff

1227
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,199
Music

1228
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:08,831
That's West true and places that are not spending as much of their discretionary income on gadgets like this

1229
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,623
Over a long period of time

1230
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,439
All these gadgets will become available to everybody

1231
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,975
Things to reduce cost

1232
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:21,887
Unless of course attorney sounds we've all concluded these things you're so hazardous and dangerous and annoying and they don't work with

1233
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,167
Supposed to anyway

1234
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,703
And we all decide to hell with it

1235
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,983
Go back to the light switches

1236
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,775
You can pry my light switch

1237
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,311
My cold dead hands

1238
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,871
Alright so

1239
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,407
Given all of this

1240
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,223
Do you have any smart devices in your home

1241
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,503
I have a few

1242
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,039
My wife

1243
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:45,439
For frankly they have a 747 worth of light switches and dimmers so that she knows exactly which ball butt is itchy

1244
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,207
Controller

1245
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:52,607
On the other hand I'm not a few Lutron programmable things that I like a lot because you talk about it

1246
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,143
That's not up for you

1247
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,703
I have a custom Entertainment System

1248
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,007
And that's a good example of

1249
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:04,127
Hazardous right because when it doesn't work have to call up a guy that lives on in miles away to come out and fix it

1250
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:08,735
It's a good example of why customization may not necessarily be the smartest thing in the world

1251
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,039
I have some of the

1252
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,599
Alphabet Nest thermostats in the house

1253
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:20,255
And I also have a system to monitor the temperature humidity in light levels in every room in the house is a mess

1254
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,279
Network money

1255
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
6lowpan

1256
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,583
Every 5 minutes

1257
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,143
Information to a server in the basement

1258
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
And

1259
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:32,031
The Wine Cellar is instrumented so that if the temperature goes up to 60° Fahrenheit

1260
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,103
SMS in my mobile telling me my wine is warming up

1261
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:42,015
So the next step is to put RFID tags on all the bottles so I can do an instantaneous inventory make

1262
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:44,063
Make sure that when I'm away no bottle is left

1263
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,343
Seller without my permission

1264
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,647
So the answer is we have a little bit

1265
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,927
Automation

1266
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:54,047
Did you build your light and temperature sensing in your wine cellar stuff yourself

1267
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,167
No this is not me in the garage with a soldering iron I actually got commercial equipment

1268
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,447
Every case

1269
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,239
Use for that

1270
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:05,311
Yeah I mean whose equipment did I use

1271
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,639
Well let's see the thermostats come from there

1272
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:14,527
The temperature sensor Mesh networking from archrock which was acquired by Cisco Systems

1273
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,623
The RFID detector was a startup company

1274
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:21,951
Where I bought it in and bought some of their equipment

1275
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:25,279
Lutron controls are commercial

1276
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,607
RN program by the same guy that did mine

1277
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,887
Entertainment System
