Hey this week

46
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
I am in Stockholm

47
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,560
Last week was Helsinki this week is Stockholm

48
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
So much

49
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
Fun I should be though

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
In Hanover

51
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,960
Actually try but it's too hard to get

52
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
A ticket

53
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,288
It was crazy expensive and then plates

54
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,592
And hotels were sold out it was

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,408
I never realized how big

56
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,456
Hannover Messi is

57
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
Is actually

58
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,808
Bigger than CES

59
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
Ncees

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
And

61
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
It is

62
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
Crazy in this

63
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,744
Actually in the last five or so years we've seen more and more

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
It come

65
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,840
Companies going to CES it really ramping up their presences

66
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,632
Starting probably

67
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
Actually it was

68
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
2014

69
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
2015

70
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
2016

71
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
Microsoft CEO Saatchi

72
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
Nutella actually gave it

73
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Keno

74
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,176
This year we saw the biggest Trends coming out of this world

75
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
Probably 5G

76
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
Inland Industrial

77
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,600
Libation and this isn't just because I care about these things it's because those are the hottest

78
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
Qualcomm was a

79
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,696
Big vendor this year they did

80
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
Cool 5G

81
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Pavilion

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
Where they set up a

83
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,864
5G Network and had several companies

84
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,168
Using that that work for things like

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
Autonomous

86
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
Vehicle that was

87
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
Hopefully operated

88
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
I know

89
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,824
Autonomous vehicles and remote operators what is that

90
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,384
It's basically when the autonomous vehicle doesn't

91
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
Remote operator takes over

92
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
But that was operating over if I cheat

93
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,856
They are GE Network right now

94
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
It was a joke at work

95
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,232
If you and I couldn't bring are 5G capable phones

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
Those exist now

97
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,096
I know they've been showed I don't know if they're actually being sold

98
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,752
Yes yes I know Samsung has a 5G phone that they've announcement shown I don't think you can buy any

99
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,544
True 5G phones yet

100
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
Gabby we don't care

101
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
Because this is industrial

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
So

103
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
We saw a video transfers over

104
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,760
5G Network so this is HD video we saw a machine control

105
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
So lots of

106
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,904
Robot arms Kuka was showing some stuff with their robot arms for wireless control with them

107
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
And

108
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
We also

109
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
Sausage stuffer

110
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
ABB

111
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
Basically all the big names

112
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
Orit robot

113
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
Except for your name

114
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
Except for my name

115
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
Which I wouldn't expect

116
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
Because I wasn't there next year

117
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,615
I'm going I'm going to book early so I can actually get my stuff

118
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
So

119
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,967
Some things that happen though that are worth mentioning for everyone

120
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:41,855
Is Microsoft and the BMW group they launched something called the open Manufacturing

121
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Program

122
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,903
And you guys might be like

123
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Blah blah

124
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
But you should

125
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Here's why

126
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,839
This is an open standard that Microsoft in BMW recruiting

127
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,655
It will also work with the reference Frame Works from

128
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
Different standards group

129
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
Call Dentistry for. O which is a bigger

130
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
European standards

131
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,311
Holden manufacturing plant

132
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
They're trying

133
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
How to create a smart Factory

134
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
Tree platform

135
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Ties back

136
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
Azure

137
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,271
And it's basically reference designs that BMWs

138
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
Contributing to the splat

139
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,855
Form in what's important here

140
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,695
These quote-unquote open platforms are really reference

141
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,255
And the reference architectures that used for

142
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Particular

143
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
Solutions

144
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
So

145
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,119
Particular software particular cloud backup

146
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Cans and they make it really easy

147
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:33,567
This is not an open effort in the sense that they're creating a standard that makes it easy to like move or cloud

148
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
The cloud Iran

149
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,407
Get data from different machines at different places this is

150
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
I'm just going to say this a lot of Market

151
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
It is valuable

152
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,295
Because a lot of these companies do not

153
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
Have

154
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
Expertise

155
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
Pulling together it

156
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
So they can just go and pick up a reference to

157
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
Right yes and this is actually related to something that was in your newsletter last week prior to Hannover Messe

158
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:04,543
Microsoft announced a bunch of azure for industrial iot advancements with their so

159
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,383
Security Center for iot Azure Sentinel as your IP hub

160
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,711
And ironically also in the newsletter

161
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,247
Very similar

162
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,111
Announcement was made but not with Microsoft it was Volkswagen teaming up with Amazon

163
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,927
For AWS iot services

164
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,463
And Amazon's going to power

165
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
Volkswagens industrial cloud

166
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,095
To integrate like 30,000 facilities in 1500 supplier so

167
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
It's like everybody's trying to

168
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
Aggregator

169
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:37,311
Production now with coyote McCloud so that it seems like the fight is on between these big cloud companies

170
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,871
Yes and I will say that Microsoft has been

171
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,663
Way ahead of Amazon

172
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
Google I don't even think they can

173
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
OK Google

174
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Cloud in the

175
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,343
But Microsoft has really done a lot of work Packaging

176
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
And hand-holding

177
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
Solutions for

178
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Industrial

179
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,023
And it shows because they are by far and away

180
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,399
And they're basically just digging in

181
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,519
An offering more and more features they've taken a page from AWS in the terms of

182
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
Saying hey what are people building

183
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
Oh

184
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,639
We should offer that is a particular feature

185
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,455
And in really repackaging things in Perry

186
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
Easy to implement

187
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,319
Ways for different industry verticals

188
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
So I want to give them props here

189
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
It's a big

190
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,231
Amazon's less awesome at that but I think they're going

191
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,815
Get more awesome and I would say also Amazon has the

192
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Developer base

193
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Demeans people can't

194
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
There plenty of Developers

195
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,751
Who are working with in Amazon to build iot Solutions

196
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
Instead of working from

197
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
Particular reference framework

198
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
The people of design

199
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
They're just like

200
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
Make it ourselves

201
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
And that's what

202
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,527
So that's kind of maybe the battle to look at is Developers

203
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,831
Versus pre-packaged solutions that

204
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
Big giant Corp

205
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
There's also

206
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,231
The open industry for. LOL

207
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Swiss

208
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
And this is a group of European

209
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
Companies

210
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
Including

211
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
Who got the robotics manufacturer

212
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
And sap

213
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
And they are

214
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
Basically trying to

215
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
Build an operating system

216
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,871
In an open operating system ecosystem

217
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
4 connected robots and

218
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
Connected processing

219
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,247
This is not new

220
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
There's a bunch of effort

221
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,319
It's like this they're usually offender

222
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
Specific

223
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,415
But here what they've done is they've created a network of

224
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
Couple different suppliers

225
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
Again

226
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,327
Putting the word open in your name putting the word Alliance does not

227
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Necessarily mean that it is open

228
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
And that everyone

229
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
Use it or

230
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,983
Want to use it there's always the danger of login

231
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
There is a

232
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,079
Definite Trend we're seeing happened here which is

233
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,895
Probably 20 years ago when you were in the it

234
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
SeaWorld

235
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,711
You saw these things proliferate

236
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
And then

237
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,879
With the launch of virtualization and services like AWS we actually saw that

238
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
Whole underlying

239
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
Computing architecture

240
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
And even solution base

241
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,559
Get kind of

242
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
People developed apis people

243
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,655
Developer platforms and services

244
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,727
It made it a lot easier to create offerings for differ

245
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
Letters and Interpol them all together

246
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
In a way that let you

247
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
Pick and choose

248
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
A little bit more

249
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Breezly and worried

250
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
There still.

251
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
But theoretically

252
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
You could get around

253
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
That makes sense

254
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
These days the big companies are

255
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,463
It's not that they're ignoring standards for their just creating their own

256
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,791
I think or maybe in parallel with existing standards

257
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
But it is a different world

258
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,655
Nit and iot than it was 20 years ago for sure

259
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
Iot

260
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
Will mature

261
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
It's just less mature

262
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,775
Are the stands now so that

263
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
It makes sense

264
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,663
Okay so we talked about 5G we talked about various open platform

265
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
And

266
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
The other thing

267
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
It's kind of a tangent with 5G

268
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,551
But I did want to mention this

269
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
Wireless

270
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
Is also

271
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
A big trend

272
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:09,023
And it may not be 5G it might be proprietary Wireless but we are seeing a lot

273
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
Of companies

274
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Creating

275
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,447
Either private 5G or private proprietary networks for the industrial iot

276
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,495
This is new because

277
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Historically

278
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,847
Factory environments are really crappy for wireless

279
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Lots of metal objects run

280
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Hang around

281
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,735
There lots of security concerns about someone being able to

282
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,551
Talk to a robotic arm and use it for ill

283
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
And

284
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
There are latency issue

285
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
So

286
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,463
5G will address some of this other Wireless standards have

287
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
Already happened

288
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,839
To address this but we're going to see more and more factories

289
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Total Wireless

290
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
And like I said in my newsletter last week

291
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,727
Actually opens up a lot of interesting opportunities around

292
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Agility in the fact

293
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,567
Tree floor in the ability to customize things

294
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
Customized Manufacturing

295
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
Processes for differ

296
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
Products in Boots

297
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Things about

298
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
So I think it's going to be kind of cool

299
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
That was a lot

300
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,647
It's a big show it's a big show we just summarized like all of it

301
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
Sore quickly

302
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,023
Let's move away from Hannover Germany and into

303
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
News

304
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,071
From Walmart

305
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
Walmart to

306
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
I think

307
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,215
Before this news are about to talk about I think

308
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
Could voice

309
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:26,335
Order things from Walmart possibly through Google Express which is

310
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
Not something I use

311
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,175
Now Walmart is introducing

312
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,223
What they called Walmart voice

313
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
Order

314
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
So they have integrated

315
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,111
They're saying they're going to integrate across platforms

316
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,415
With multiple partners but the first one is

317
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
Google

318
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:46,815
And basically you will be able to order things or put things in your Walmart shopping card

319
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,887
To your Google home devices in the Google Assistant

320
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,751
And then. You do that over the course of a couple days perhaps

321
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,335
And then you say okay I'm ready to check out now and

322
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
You're good to go you

323
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
Purchase all your items

324
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,551
So this isn't quite new I think it's more of a revamp or refocus a little bit

325
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,135
So with you could do reordering

326
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
Through Google Express

327
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Quit Walmart

328
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,743
What's up what you could voice reorder products

329
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,559
It went through the Google Express platform

330
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
On your Google

331
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,887
And now basically this is

332
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
Better in a

333
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
Migration on the

334
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,495
It's not through Google Express and

335
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
It has that

336
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,335
You just were talking about this ability to learn

337
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Yep

338
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,015
So it's rolling out slowly but rolling out now so you should

339
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:43,135
See something come to your Google Assistant with Walmart tablet saying that's coming weeks

340
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,743
Yeah I think this will be interesting to watch him very I don't actually do a lot of voice ordering on the

341
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Amazon books

342
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,399
Cuz you people do that's the thing when you look at all these reports and charts to come out of recorder

343
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:01,055
Voice ordering with shopping is still very low on the list of activities

344
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,455
Reason why is I will tell it to reorder it like a good option would be my arc I get these dog toothbrush bones Bass

345
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,783
Play for my dog and I ordered them all the time I have a virtual Dash

346
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,111
So I would like to be able to like Amazon reorder this

347
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
Spy on Amazon

348
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,231
There's like four different prices for the same size properties

349
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,583
Sometimes it defaults to the highest price sometimes it doesn't but I don't feel comfortable doing that

350
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,143
Right and then the other thing is I have to say the product

351
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Exactly

352
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
Perfectly every time

353
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,495
This particular partnership addresses

354
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
Both of those

355
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,823
Concerns when it learns what I'm actually ordering

356
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,407
To my hope is that Walmart only has one price for

357
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,455
For these items so if I like this price

358
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,503
I can just be like yes I don't have

359
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
Double check

360
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:48,415
Right and price comparisons using voice is not ideal in my experience

361
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,487
No it's terrible cuz you can't even tell

362
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Cheapest kids

363
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
On Amazon

364
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
Okay then you'll get it

365
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
7 weeks

366
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
You won't get exactly what you

367
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
So that's good

368
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
Amazon. Does

369
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
What kind of a fun

370
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
They do have a fun patent

371
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
We spoke about

372
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,687
Drone deliveries I believe it was in Australia

373
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
A couple weeks ago on the show

374
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,855
And people were a little upset because the Drone noise for the deliveries

375
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,927
Was basically causing issues with pets

376
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,743
And I've seen that before with my dog because these drums

377
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:28,095
Ultrasonic frequencies that we can hear but animals can

378
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,447
And then there's just the regular drone noise that's kind of a buzz and annoying to all of us

379
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
So

380
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,799
Amazon file for patent back in 2016 but

381
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
Was just granted it this week

382
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
And it should address the

383
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,991
Drum noise problem to a large extent if they ever implemented

384
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:51,391
The idea is that their delivery drones would have an inflatable balloon in the and the Drone will take off

385
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,951
With your product from the warehouse it will come to your house

386
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
But then the balloon will inflate

387
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:02,911
And that's the mechanism that the Drone will descend with so you won't hear the drum noise because it won't

388
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:09,311
Using its propellers of that point would be using the balloon to come down and then the balloon would re-inflate to go

389
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,127
Make the Drone go back up so I presume there's some

390
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Helium

391
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,223
Tank in this drum to refill the balloon

392
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,807
It's rather interesting it's a clever solution to a real problem

393
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,367
Imagine it's not helium helium is actually

394
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
I imagine it's he

395
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
When it just

396
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
I don't know

397
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,487
I know it has to be

398
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:32,095
Something lighter than typical are asked to be enough of it to

399
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,679
Carry enough weight so I don't know we're very concerned about

400
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
Supplies Outlet

401
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,055
This is where a little bit of knowledge that you very little good

402
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,359
Yeah I'm all for that I hate the sound of drones

403
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Innocent

404
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
You Kevin

405
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Have discovered

406
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Something

407
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:53,343
Before we get to that should we talk about your Discovery first or should we talk about

408
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
The

409
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
Other people's stuff

410
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:00,767
Let's talk about the other people's discover these are very related items so earlier this week

411
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,071
Android police notice

412
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
That

413
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
On the Google

414
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,191
Storefronts the online storefront

415
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,775
Taking their connected devices are they were showing something called The Nest

416
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Hub

417
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
Max witch

418
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,383
Obviously has not been announced or we would have been talking about it

419
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,735
This is supposed to be according to the images and what was leaked

420
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:26,111
On the storefront it's no longer there obviously this is supposed to be a 10 inch smart display

421
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,159
With a nest camera

422
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,463
So you would not only be able to make

423
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,791
Video calls on Duo on the nest hubmax

424
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,631
But then you could keep an eye on things at home we could build a nest cam

425
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
Get your motion and sound alerts

426
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:44,031
Also supposed to have stereo speakers so something I guess

427
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:48,127
I guess something similar to our Google home hubs little 7in

428
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Smart display

429
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
And the Google

430
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,295
What's the speaker the Google home Max

431
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
Google home Max

432
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
The big speaker

433
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,927
The big speaker like the $400 speaker

434
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,487
It sounds like a combination of those two products

435
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,327
If it's legit and considering it was actually on Google site

436
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
Yeah I think somebody hit the

437
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
Publish this page

438
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
Button a little too soon

439
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
So

440
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,263
We don't know anything else about it but presumably

441
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
If it's a real

442
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
Really coming tomorrow

443
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
I'm thinking I owe next month

444
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
Good time to make that an hour

445
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
And then

446
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,247
Website although

447
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,295
Maybe a little more clandestine

448
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
Kevin you did some digging into

449
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Discovered

450
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:36,255
I discovered many many references to a color a board not a device because

451
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,327
Is Google names all of the boards for its products

452
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,143
Not the devices pick the code name for a boards

453
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
Was spotted in

454
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:49,823
The chromium commit log which is open source so that's why it's all available to the public is where I find out all the Chromebook news

455
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,383
The name of the board is called Mistral

456
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,199
And to clarify we should say

457
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,527
So when Kevin says bored most of you know this but if you don't

458
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,343
It is a collection of it is a physical

459
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,903
Board with chips on it that is used

460
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,231
Slap that into a product and connect all the connectors and then poop

461
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
You have

462
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,303
Computer or smart display or thermostat or whatever

463
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
Or whatever it might be correct

464
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
Correct

465
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:18,239
So Mistral has a mini code references to the recently announced

466
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,263
I'll come

467
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,079
Qcs 400s Oasys

468
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,663
And why is that important or relevant well that is

469
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
Outcomes

470
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:31,295
New AI enabled soc for smart speakers and

471
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,831
Digital assistants

472
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
An AV receivers

473
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
And it has

474
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,279
Mesh Wi-Fi capabilities Bluetooth LE mesh capabilities on device

475
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
Voice recognition

476
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,119
As well as a zigbee radios

477
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,727
I kind of put two and two and two together

478
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,799
Looks to me like all these code references

479
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,383
Indicate Google is working on a new

480
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,711
Either smart display or smart speaker or both

481
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
Because one of the chips

482
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
Has a GPU

483
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
The Qualcomm has

484
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,599
Created one of those not so

485
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,903
They could go either way here and I

486
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Eating

487
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
It really sucks to me

488
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,279
Google's combining its Google Home Products

489
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
And possibly a Google

490
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:19,167
Wi-Fi product which is something I'd said they should do and also

491
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,263
Likely or at least possible that this could actually be a

492
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,823
True Hub at try radio hub with

493
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Li-fi

494
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,383
Bluetooth and zigbee

495
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:33,503
So lots of unknowns here but I do know they're working actively on

496
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
A product

497
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
Will we see it I don't know

498
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,367
Will it be what I think it is

499
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
Again I don't know

500
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,023
But it is definitely something to look forward to I do not think this would be in time for next month's

501
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,863
Google IO I think this would be more of a fall announcement with their

502
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,447
Typical pixel products that they do roughly September October

503
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,007
And with a zippy radio

504
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Couple things

505
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,359
Amazon has their Echo Plus which combines

506
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,175
A tri-band radio so Bluetooth WiFi and zigbee

507
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,967
For smartphone control

508
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,039
It does not act as a Wi-Fi router

509
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
It did bite

510
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
Euro so maybe

511
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
That's coming

512
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
Mississippi Braves

513
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
Could also be

514
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Thread

515
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,863
Because they both use the same underlying

516
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
For the radio

517
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,727
So is the point is this

518
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,799
Define predefined Zippy or could it be possibly threat

519
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,335
Is it yours it just 802.

520
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:37,759
That's a good question and just the fact that there is a CD radio on this SOC doesn't mean they'll use it

521
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,575
That's true there was a CB radio in the Google Wi-Fi

522
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,623
ASAP I said they never

523
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
So

524
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,719
That is true

525
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,279
By the way and then this is just a little

526
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,583
I don't know maybe it will be on Jeopardy someday

527
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,631
Do you know what a Mistral is

528
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
Do a mystery

529
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,191
Is it a bird straw-like

530
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,031
No it's a strong cold north-westerly wind that

531
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,335
Those through southern France

532
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
Meaning in winter

533
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,151
Why do I bring that up

534
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,735
Because the code name of the board and Google Wi-Fi

535
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
Is Gail

536
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
G a l e

537
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,831
Oh

538
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
Wi-Fi with the wind theme

539
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,416
I like yes

540
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,280
I wish I knew more power Regional wind

541
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
I'm like yeah I'm

542
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,608
They're good at parties to people

543
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
And that's all I know

544
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
But okay

545
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,568
There's a theme there we'll see if we see any cool

546
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,872
Google home hubs that's good news

547
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
Because I do think

548
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
We need to see continuing innovation

549
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,552
And let us move on

550
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
To something we probably don't talk

551
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,624
Enough about

552
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,648
Which is

553
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
Surveillance

554
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,280
I didn't mean to make my voice sound all robotic

555
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
Keep it kind of did

556
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,120
So The Intercept published the story about

557
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,912
Sidewalk Labs which is

558
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,960
One of alphabets independent companies

559
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
Doing smart cities efforts

560
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
And

561
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
They actually

562
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,872
I have a program called replica

563
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,176
They're offering two cities that shows

564
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:15,552
Basically how users are using city streets and where they're moving around in that sort of thing

565
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,856
What's noteworthy

566
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,904
Is the cities don't actually

567
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,952
Know where the state is coming from

568
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
Speculated is from

569
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
Cell phone data

570
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
They're probably right

571
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,096
This relates back to

572
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
Foursquare

573
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,424
Which showed off a product

574
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,008
Is a concept product at South by Southwest

575
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
But you see

576
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
Hot spots in the city

577
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,360
Of Austin

578
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
Based on people

579
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
Vocation

580
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,992
Around town and their cell phone location

581
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:49,088
What they were doing is Foursquare provides location infrastructure for

582
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
Apps like Twitter in Uber

583
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,976
So everybody's phone that has those apps on it basically is checking into

584
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,792
Wish I could handle for square butt for square noses

585
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,864
And so they were trying to aggregate that data

586
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,960
So if you were single person moving around it wasn't showing that data

587
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,496
But if someone

588
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
And a bunch of people were at 8

589
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
Place it would show

590
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,872
There's a lot of people right here

591
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Anna's house

592
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,456
Kind of like what sidewalk slabs is off

593
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Offering for

594
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
What's with replicas

595
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Now

596
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
This is where it gets dicey

597
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
Like are we okay

598
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
With

599
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,904
This data being used in an

600
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Aggregated

601
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,000
I would say yes as long as it doesn't

602
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
They don't

603
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
I would like the next track I know they're track

604
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,632
As long as they don't show individual

605
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
Pat's

606
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,704
Or I mean you can get a lot of

607
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,312
Personal information just from your device and I don't mean the personal data

608
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,104
What's your email and such I mean

609
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,504
Specific device identifiers that are tied to maybe your cell phone account for example so they have to be very careful

610
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,552
About what day do they collect here

611
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,832
It should all be at

612
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,856
Corrugated when they're showing

613
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,416
Because in this brings me back to like Strava and

614
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
Nets heatmap remembered

615
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
The year or two ago when they

616
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
Publisher keep mapping

617
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,328
You could see all Strava users

618
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,608
Were sharing location

619
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
You can see like

620
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,216
Oh hey there

621
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,568
A couple people using the sap running around in the middle of nowhere in the desert

622
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,336
Then people

623
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
Oh

624
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,384
That's a US Army base

625
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,712
Secret operations you have to

626
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:24,320
Implement something so if there are fewer than a hundred or I don't know what the no

627
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
Number is

628
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
That certain number of people in a

629
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
Location

630
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,672
You shouldn't show it

631
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
Outlier should be shown

632
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,256
You shouldn't be able to

633
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,792
Track one person's

634
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
Half through

635
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
For the day

636
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
End

637
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,888
As these things become

638
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
Boar

639
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,960
Useful than I would say they are useful

640
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,240
That's the other thing

641
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:47,360
I mean if I want to know how many people are at my favorite restaurant right now is

642
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
Is it busy right now

643
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,224
Different kind of information that would tell me that Google actually offers this

644
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
Google

645
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,320
You like search a restaurant and a location on your phone

646
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,344
Ashley sweet

647
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
Super busy

648
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:04,256
The other thing is it would be nice for against leaders to have access to the state of

649
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
4

650
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,632
People like if you're looking at an emergency room it would be really useful to see

651
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
Pads of

652
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
People

653
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,776
A places so people tracking is actually really important

654
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
It's just very difficult

655
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,152
Lot of places are trying to do a

656
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
Sensors mounted

657
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,480
Doorways and that's what

658
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Best

659
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
So

660
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Is this awesome

661
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,368
It's all in how it's implemented I think

662
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,184
Yammy Google could I have a really important data

663
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
Product to sell

664
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,024
Can you could even use cell phones as a

665
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:40,352
Can detect three ways does it is a means to detect traffic

666
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,936
Right you could use that you can sell that data to Lake

667
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,240
Companies for occupancy in for

668
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
Formation

669
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
Again

670
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,080
Depending on how it's used

671
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,896
So I have a very serious question

672
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
Okay

673
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
Does anybody use Foursquare anymore

674
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
You don't have to

675
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:05,952
Your app so I know in the in the background that I know a lot of apps do this yes

676
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
Realize necessarily

677
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,048
You realize it when Twitter put your location

678
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,240
Actually in like

679
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
You know if you're using Uber

680
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,056
Uber has to know where you are

681
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,896
And it's not magic now the fact that it's running all the time in the background

682
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
That's kind of

683
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
That could be disclosed

684
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,760
What's better and actually there was

685
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,808
This is a little bit different but there wasn't

686
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,832
SA

687
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
This week in the knee

688
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
Times about

689
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,160
Cell phone companies selling

690
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Upset

691
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,744
No I don't know if that should go up to the airport

692
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Patient level

693
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,072
Soda cell phone companies that are providing the

694
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:48,192
Physical Hardware should your applications failed to sell this data if your

695
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,472
Cell provider is it

696
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:55,872
I don't know I'd rather see it at the app level because consumers have more control in terms of permissions and

697
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
And so on

698
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:03,296
Just aggregated data that the carriers have I don't care that they sold me my device I'm paying for the device it's my device

699
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
I don't really want them

700
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,880
Getting into the space personally

701
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
That sounds okay

702
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
Now I don't trust any

703
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Okay

704
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,864
She doesn't even shared her location with me

705
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,448
You don't know where I am actually got to know where I am in Stockholm

706
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Okay

707
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,776
So last week on the Internet of Things podcast

708
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Hotline

709
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
A question about

710
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
How

711
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,408
You can use Madam a

712
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,480
To control automated blinds

713
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
Because there isn't currently like

714
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
I really awesome blind function

715
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
This person was using the wink

716
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
Separate

717
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,184
Heaven and I

718
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:48,352
We have an answer but it really wasn't a full answer and you guys were like you guys didn't tell them there are options

719
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,912
Farthest was cuz I wanted to test it out at home

720
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,216
I wasn't sure what I could do from here

721
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
But

722
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
Everyone pointed out that

723
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,568
They can do this with if

724
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
And with stringify

725
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,176
Stringify as a company that, cast by

726
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,480
And you can still download it it's free

727
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,760
Very complex

728
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,832
But

729
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,904
Several people gave us the instructions so we're going to share those

730
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,232
But before I do that

731
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,352

00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
It is a Kinect

749
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
IO

750
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,288
And the board basically

751
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,872
You plug it into your existing wired alarm system and then

752
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,664
You can control it through the SmartThings Hub

753
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,224
So this is kind of a limited use case but

754
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
You're going to like it

755
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,040
Is it let you use your old

756
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,344
Wired alarm systems

757
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,392
Unless you talk to it through SmartThings

758
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:21,536
That's why people there are people looking for that product because we get calls on that how do I

759
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,840
Extend my old wired

760
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,144
Security system to make it Wireless so

761
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,192
Perfect yay

762
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,496
All right so that is going to be April's

763
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,032

And it be entered to win

767
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,064
While we're at it

768

We get to this answer for you

769
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
We should announce

770
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,184
March is winter

771
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
Who doesn't

772
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
Have a name

773
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:58,144
So he does he just didn't provide it but that's okay because we can text him and

774
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
Cadiz information

775
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:03,008
So we did choose a winner you'll be

776
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
Schlage connect

777
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
Lock

778
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,592
And no name

779
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,408
Thanks for listening thanks for leaving a message and

780
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
You'll be hearing

781
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
Okay

782
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,504
So let's get back to

783
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
How this thing

784
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,880
The original question was about a Z-Wave motor

785
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Engraver

786
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,696
And that was the two

787
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,232
Raise and lower smart blinds

788
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
And wink

789
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
Can do that

790
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
However

791
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
Madame a cannot

792
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,680
Understand what do that for you through wink

793
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
However

794
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,008
If you create a shortcut in Wink 2

795
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,824
Raise or lower your blinds Jose to shortcuts

796
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,616
You can then connect

797
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,432
Madame a with wings through EFT

798
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:47,552
Create a recipe that says hey when I say this to Madame a run this wink shortcut

799
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,880
So that's the way to link those because you can't do it natively

800
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
And

801
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:55,232
On the stringify side and this is going to be much

802
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,512
Much more.

803
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,584
So first off stringify needs to see the blood

804
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
Then you create

805
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
A flow

806
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,192
So once you got stringify

807
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,520
Able to see the blinds usually you could do that and wink or smart

808
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
So however

809
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,616
Then you basically create a stringify flow

810
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
And you included as a c

811
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
Courtesy

812
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
Can you have that flow tied to

813
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Madame makeup

814
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,296
Also actually use it for a

815
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
Vim commands

816
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,112
And then you can

817
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
Through the scene

818
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,184
Do you say Madam a

819
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
Start

820
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
Blah blah blah

821
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:31,840
You may have to say a stringify to start but I think I say a stringify to run

822
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
Blah blah blah

823
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,400
And then it will do so

824
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,936
So that is how you would do that on

825
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,008
And remember both shift and string

826
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:46,176
And just to be clear this is Wink specific because the caller had wink and the Graber smart blind motor

827
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:49,504
For smart thing you can actually do this natively with

828
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,808
There's a device Handler

829
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,600
Where you can change your

830
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,440
Blinds and stringify to beat act like a dimmer switch

831
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
Yes

832
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:03,072
Lots of options for our color last

833
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
We are sorry that we

834
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
Progestin

835
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:11,008
And propstore listeners are we got several emails and voicemails on

836
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,800
Exactly what we just explained with

837
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
EFT and stringify

838
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:18,944
So we didn't give a complete answer because of Stacy said she really want to test it before we actually

839
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
Could say yeah this will work

840
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
But I haven't been home in 2 weeks

841
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,552
So exactly very difficult

842
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:29,696
It's just me. I would know that if you shared your location with me

843
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,536
So that concludes the new portion of this week's podcast

844
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,840
And stay tuned for a

845
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,864
Conversation

846
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,680
Chief Kirkland from where works

847
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,728
His company is building a

848
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
Device to help

849
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,568
Visually impaired people Wayside using haptic

850
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,104
Can we talk about

851
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
That particular product

852
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
We also talked about

853
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:56,576
How we should be using haptics and tips for designers on building haptic feedback into their devices

854
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
Json products you're going to like it

A message from

856
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Our sponsor

857
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,744
This would sponsor is software

858
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,280
AG

859
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:11,680
Hey everyone we're taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is soft

860
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:16,288
Software Ag and I have Bruce Cain was part of the software AG iot

861
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,848
Supers let's kick it off with telling people

862
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,152
What is software AG doing with the

863
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
Internet of Things

864
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,992
Capri Jesus 50 year old soccer

865
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,272
Company

866
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,576
Bread-and-butter is with integration

867
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
Software

868
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,368
So we allowed

869
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,648
Companies to talk

870
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:35,232
To each other in the internet of things we have

871
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,280
Cumulocity iot plan

872
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,584
Ashley platform

873
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,680
Is a full iot platform that can be run at the edge

874
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:48,800
As well as in the cloud and that's very important because now we can do a lot more work at the edge

875
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,592
Then just up in the club

876
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,920
Excellent in Edge Computing is all the rage these days

877
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,992
And I understand that you have a great story involving robot

878
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,296
They can really underscore the importance of edge

879
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,344
Can you share absolute

880
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,904
Are cars painted when you buy a new

881
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
New car is a robot

882
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
Comes in and does all the paint

883
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
No more human

884
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,096
Great thing about this is that the robots can analyze

885
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
Howard's

886
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,192
Painting how fast the arm is moving so you get a perfect

887
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
Paint job

888
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,056
Downside though is that takes a lot of data

889
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,336
Can make that happen

890
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:28,992
The other side is we as consumers are a lot more particular than we used to be and we look for every

891
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:34,112
Little defect if there's one tiny blemish in my paint I don't want that car I want another one

892
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:37,184
So because of that the paint jobs have to be part

893
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,232
There's a lot that goes into a perk

894
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,000
Paint job

895
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,328
That's not just a paint in the air mixture but also the

896
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
Humidity in surroundings

897
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,400
Temperature

898
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,680
There's an awful lot

899
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:52,032
Of data that needs to be consumed by these robots in order for them to

900
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,336
In the past

901
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,152
They would send that data up to the cloud

902
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:02,784
The cloud would do the analytics and decide G it's getting a little more humid so let's put a little more

903
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,112
Paint to air mixture and would do those adjustments

904
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,672
Then the command down the adjustment would be made in Italy

905
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
Continue to paint

906
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,744
Problem is you'd be on the 3rd

907
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,048
Ask before you got that information

908
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,840
So that robot needed

909
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,888
That data at the edge

910
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:22,752
Quinoa ciot being installed at the edge running all this

911
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,568
Analytics at the edge remove that late

912
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:31,968
See time from sending that date up to the cloud they're able to do much better paint jobs less blemishes

913
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,784
Which means less reduce or less

914
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
Cost to the manufacturer

915
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:41,440
Excellent so if I wanted to experiment with software AG Eskimi lacity platform

916
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,976
Where can I go to find out more

917
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:49,632
Yes you can download a trial at sacree jd.com iot now and I really

918
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,448
Encourage you to do so because you can connect a device

919
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,984
Less than 2 minutes

920
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,312
Create some analytics in less than a minute and a half

921
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
Create dashboards

922
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,664
So in less than 5 minutes

923
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
You can beat

924
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:07,808
Behrman thing with your devices connected to an iot platform

925
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:19,072
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

926
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
Is Keith

927
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
Kirkland's

928
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,400
Annie's Biko founder

929
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
Where were

930
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,496
And we are going to be talking today about haptic

931
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
Hi Keith how are you today

932
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,336
And on fantastic how are you

933
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,128
Man I am super excited

934
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
I love happy

935
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,456
Dixon for everybody who's like

936
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,784
It's basically using vibration to like indicate to you

937
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,832
Touch it's basically touch

938
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
To indicate something

939
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:46,720
I really wanted to tell me my right for my left because I'm not very good at that

940
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,024
But we're going to explore all the ways

941
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,304
So

942
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
First off

943
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,352
Keep let's talk about

944
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,632
Whatwears works

945
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,728
We design products and experiences that communicate information through touch

946
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,080
Parkway band is a wearable haptic navigation bicycle

947
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:07,968
Basically we forgot it would have got people to what in a destination using vibrating shoes

948
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,248
Without the need for any

949
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,272
Visual audio

950
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
And

951
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:18,208
Back in 2017 we use that technology to help us Blind Side

952
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,768
New York City marathon

953
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,816
Which is awesome and you

954
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
You kind of have to tell us

955
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,144
Why only the first 15 miles

956
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,912
Did he get tired

957
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
Oh yes

958
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,496
So basically you know

959
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,520
The Merritt Island

960
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,800
It was Marathon day and

961
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
We were getting everything

962
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,664
Kevin my co-founder also ran the race with Simon

963
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,480
And we put all the devices that everything

964
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,784
And it turned out that the weather

965
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
Was really really bad

966
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,856
And so it ended up

967
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,416
Raining for most of the marathon

968
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,952
And about 15 miles then

969
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,488
We basically ate you know

970
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,632
Put together the night before and didn't think about what I said was thinking about trying to get him through this race

971
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,448
That was a sound like a surprise ride

972
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,472
At some point

973
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
Midwifery that divides Gatos

974
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,056
Stop working because of the rain

975
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,128
That is such a bummer but it's also like

976
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,944
Valuable life lessons

977
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,504
What is provocative

978
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,320
All right

979
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,392
So I have been excited by haptics

980
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,720
For really long time like I said I have a terrible sense of direction

981
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,256
I've always wanted my phone.

982
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,328
Book that is right no not that way

983
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Go the other way

984
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
That's my settle

985
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,448
And we've had it in

986
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,752
Actually phones for a while in terms of like

987
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,080
That little vibration that you get when you touch your phone screen

988
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,104
That is haptic feedback

989
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,896
But you actually got started

990
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:46,272
In a way that I think is super cool for iot and wearables Market which was trying to build

991
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,088
A suit to teach you Kung Fu can you tell me about

992
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,904
I had always been a

993
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,952
Big movement Lerner and

994
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,744
I always ended up with you

995
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:00,096
Weird injuries ww3 stop me from doing that movement that I started to love

996
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
Learning how to do

997
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,656
And so

998
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,936
Program at Pride

999
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,520
Add a previous background mechanical engineering and then

1000
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,080
Did that for that and then I decided to

1001
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,664
Come back and see if she make her and sad and so I knew that.

1002
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,712
And I can see the sign that if I see

1003
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,528
I was going to Industry for a while mainly going handbag stuff

1004
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:22,112
A better time at lesportsac and Calvin Klein and coach

1005
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,672
Anytime came out lyrics Dance With My Father

1006
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
Amazon handbags

1007
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,720
Bios

1008
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:31,072
Is a great way to use designer for Humanity and someone back to school

1009
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:35,680
The Grand Design to figure out what that might be and along the way I ended up being study

1010
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
Brooklyn

1011
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,520
Renovation design program which

1012
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,568
That allowed me to go to town what's that mean

1013
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,592
Technology

1014
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:47,968
How do I integrate

1015
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,248
Technology and Society

1016
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,368
So much, until I do something that

1017
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,696
Is really really great and so at the time

1018
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
Still kind of

1019
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:04,352
End it movement challenges that I was having I kind of put together the pieces that was like okay I think

1020
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,168
It's possible for you to make a suit that can help you to

1021
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,704
Learn kung fu

1022
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,728
And I got that

1023
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:15,104
See something inside that I had and I thought I was totally super duper original I was like wow

1024
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
Like the Matrix is now

1025
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,408
And then now all of

1026
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,176
All the sudden

1027
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:24,576
I go and I do a go to research since when I realized that you have been built at MIT card to check goes to

1028
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:27,136
And basically they kind of validated all this

1029
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
That I had when I was

1030
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:28,928
Thinking of

1031
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,792
And that was basically like how do you use hotfix to come correct from

1032
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
Posture

1033
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,144
And so that was kind of the permits and the idea but

1034
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,704
Challenging that suit with a

1035
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,240
What was kind of really started

1036
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,800
Groovy Cambodia parent is that

1037
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,616
But I want you to raise your breasts 2 inches off of your lap

1038
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,920
Using vibration how do I tell you to do that

1039
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,968
How do you tell me to do that

1040
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,760
That was my next question for you

1041
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,064
So I can put a motor to top of your

1042
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
Dress right

1043
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,136
And maybe it will feel like you should be pulled up

1044
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,440
Apple at the bottom of your results

1045
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,000
Krista at work kind of

1046
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,072
Hadn't really been done yet and there was no

1047
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:11,424
Things are kind of based off of like what we start to call a haptic language away of

1048
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,776
How can I signal to you to do information without having to tell you what to do

1049
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,312
Without having to explain it

1050
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,104
How can I be so intuitive

1051
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,152
That you can just understand that this is

1052
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,992
And that's kind of what we talked about haptic design

1053
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,040
We're like we're using tots

1054
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,856
And the same way that a graphical designer uses

1055
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,624
Schedule

1056
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,672
2 light design experience

1057
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,952
For our users

1058
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,744
And where

1059
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,792
Just kind of talking into a different sense

1060
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
You know why not

1061
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,144
Is kind of often overlooked in the in the design space

1062
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,216
I like it this is actually something that I

1063
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,544
Read about and I've actually wanted for a while so not kung fu

1064
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,080
Stupid I do a lot of Pilates

1065
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
As part of that

1066
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,407
I sit there and

1067
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,223
Like I do if I just had a little vibration here that was like

1068
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
Activate this muscle

1069
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
Right here

1070
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
Or

1071
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,855
You're doing it wrong but then I did quickly realize that

1072
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,647
What you're talkin about this language

1073
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Haptics

1074
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,695
What apps come into play like

1075
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
What is like

1076
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,767
Activate that muscle versus

1077
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,351
Stay put but

1078
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,119
You guys

1079
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,167
Kind of figured it out on the way finder

1080
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,703
Makes sense so talk to me about

1081
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,239
Your haptic portal

1082
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,335
Yes I have two quarter is this idea

1083
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,383
I kind of got coin through kind of

1084
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,663
Are using

1085
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,967
The device and having the experience and

1086
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,503
Basically what it is

1087
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,783
You can imagine

1088
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,063
You're looking forward

1089
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:36,415
That you know I'm not sure you know I feel like most people play Pac-Man

1090
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,207
Or have cut out a large enough lights

1091
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,255
Pie crust baked pie

1092
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
Either way you look at it at your face

1093
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,583
Infobear you're kind of like BMP

1094
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,607
Pac-Man

1095
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
That's the correct

1096
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,727
Lego basic

1097
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,775
Everything else is some basic Lisa

1098
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,335
Some varying degree of wrong from that and so will be

1099
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:59,455
We did it we decided 360 have to experience it as you change orientation

1100
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,015
Is it bad to give you constant feedback to let you know

1101
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:06,367
Exactly how wrong you are and whether you're getting stronger or whether you're turning more into

1102
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,159
What we consider the correct direction

1103
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,951
Which is why the device happens

1104
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,279
Got it why choose to do it that way

1105
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,607
I mean my gut when thinking about communication right

1106
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
And communication

1107
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Your touch is like

1108
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:24,031
Like we have to figure out this like intuitive language for haptic feedback just like we did for like

1109
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:29,663
Touch-sensitive screens on devices were all in a Lego pinch-to-zoom and swiping so

1110
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,479
Why go with something that's a little bit more

1111
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,271
I want to say generic maybe more basic

1112
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,319
One of the things is that

1113
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,111
Language acquisition is

1114
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,391
Really challenging

1115
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,183
You know like

1116
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,487
Currently learning Swedish outside learning Japanese

1117
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
German

1118
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:48,607
Spanish is probably my best bet so far and you know it just takes a lot of time

1119
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,375
How to learn a language

1120
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,911
It's the one of the things that we're both

1121
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,983
Be careful about while we're going to tap that language is

1122
00:43:54,239 --> 00:44:00,383
That we need to make sure that the language acquisition time that the time that it takes for you to understand.

1123
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,431
Experience is a short at Papa

1124
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,735
And now so the way we've done that

1125
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,831
The language creation and the two major components

1126
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,135
Suppression of your haptic experiences

1127
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,695
And how experiences are

1128
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,975
Wheatley design

1129
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:15,999
Haptic

1130
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,279
Experiences

1131
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,815
That deliver

1132
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
1

1133
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:23,167
Piece of information is critical to the function of the device

1134
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:27,007
Extremely effectively and very intuitive William very quickly

1135
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,799
Anastasis I have to corridor

1136
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,847
That would have the court order

1137
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,127
We get people in the life

1138
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
We say

1139
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,431
Do a 360 spin

1140
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:38,271
And we tell them to spin again at the stop in the direction that they think

1141
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,295
Is the right way to go

1142
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,087
And most people can figure out

1143
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,135
Within about 15 seconds

1144
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,439
And those are the only instructions that they have

1145
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,231
And so we had to make sure that

1146
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:51,327
The main function of the device could be Mastered by any person that picked up a spice

1147
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,607
Straight Out of the Box

1148
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
And then

1149
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,167
The second part of that is

1150
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
Optic

1151
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,495
Russians have expressions and more like worth

1152
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,823
Experiences have like a chips right you know that.

1153
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,151
Immediate thing there's an immediate reaction is very intuitive

1154
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,967
You know whether you like it or not this one thing but you know like

1155
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:11,295
The experience and understanding that something just occurred of instantaneous

1156
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
Bright

1157
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,367
And then we have to have to get special

1158
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,391
Kids like us

1159
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,231
Because you got an A on your paper today so I'm whatever right

1160
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,255
Self-expression

1161
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,583
Communicate some discrete piece of information that is important

1162
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,631
A left turn is coming up in 30 ft

1163
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:32,287
Please take a little bit more time to learn and I'm still trying to simplify these as well to make them really distinctive that

1164
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,567
Experiences

1165
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,847
The more advanced features

1166
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:38,431
They give you more advanced and you want some information enter the experience

1167
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:41,759
I wanted you to understand the initial experience

1168
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
The haptic experience

1169
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,855
They can go into the expressions and get more

1170
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,183
Kind of like important and significant information for their travels

1171
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,255
But we had to design something that worked out of the box.

1172
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,327
BG's instantaneously it was it was super important

1173
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:01,727
So you guys are designing this for people who are blind or visually impaired but

1174
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,263
I kind of look at this and I'm like

1175
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,055
I wouldn't mind having the sort of

1176
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,895
Feedback in my day-to-day life especially for things like Anna wayfinding and different

1177
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175
Office Buildings or

1178
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,503
Hiking trails trying to find the actual Trail is supposed to like

1179
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:17,087
Now I'm suddenly stuck in a Ravine and I don't know how I'm getting there

1180
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,879
So I'm curious Lake

1181
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,695
What do you need to make this happen and then

1182
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,511
Could it go beyond just the visually impaired

1183
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,559
Initially when we started

1184
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,887
We were just trying to get people out of their phones and back into the real world

1185
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,983
And so we saw all these opportunities where

1186
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,055
The screen based devices that we were using

1187
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,383
We're requiring a huge amount of our visual attention

1188
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,663
We thought that

1189
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,943
You know navigation

1190
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,223
Inherently visual

1191
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,503
And so

1192
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,063
To be able to navigate and use your vision

1193
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,367
Functionally while navigating a getting there

1194
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,927
Information system other senses

1195
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,487
And so we see kind of have to

1196
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,071
The next Frontier you look at every other sense

1197
00:46:59,327 --> 00:46:59,839
There is

1198
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,399
A hundred billion dollar Industries built around them

1199
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,447
You know like I'm with the

1200
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,495
The immersion of arbr

1201
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
You know have

1202
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,335
Full 360 4K

1203
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,639
You know high-definition video you have

1204
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:18,783
3D Audios in the box drop 20 feet behind you over your left shoulder but then when you go to pick up that box

1205
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,831
You still have the experience of

1206
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:24,671
Having to pretend that there's something your hands when there is that so

1207
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,695
We seek on Apopka

1208
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
Texas kind of life

1209
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,255
Kunming industry

1210
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,047
That's going to start

1211
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,583
Create an impact in

1212
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,631
Media and designers and

1213
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,679
And it's on right and right now

1214
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,959
We kind of see that

1215
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,263
Working with the Blind and Visually Impaired

1216
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,311
For the first part of the experience

1217
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,847
Want it really

1218
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,639
WorkSource Prince because

1219
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,175
Tabata visually impaired

1220
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
Population

1221
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,247
They actually have the greatest

1222
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,039
Understanding of tactile acuity

1223
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,063
The best possible

1224
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,855
Designing for

1225
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:58,463
And so we understand that like and we can really nail. You safe than every other use

1226
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,767
Case of follow suit binder

1227
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,303
And so, that's our plan right now

1228
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,863
You guys have been doing this for a while

1229
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
And

1230
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,423
You've learned valuable things about water

1231
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,983
But

1232
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,335
When you mentioned like in gaming and picking up a box and that's where thing I'm like oh

1233
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,615
Yes please

1234
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:20,991
So what are some of the things you've learned in playing with haptics as much as you guys have

1235
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,783
I know you felt away ban but

1236
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,575
You guys have also built

1237
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,391
You thought your kung fu suit or tried to fill part of that

1238
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:32,511
Text me about the things you've learned that you could pass along to other designers who are like

1239
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,303
I'd love to get involved in that

1240
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,583
What do I need to know

1241
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,655
So I think the first thing is is bad

1242
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,471
You got to have a bit of understanding and physiology

1243
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,031
Different parts of the body have different resume

1244
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
Wish instead

1245
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,359
You know that your hands your lips

1246
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,407
Your time. Pretty amazing

1247
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,455
You know your back is pretty bad

1248
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,271
And so when you're designing you have to experience

1249
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:59,903
Usually has to be pressing against some forcing of the skin to be effective and it depending on what part of the body that you're

1250
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,183
Designing for

1251
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,999
It really changes kind of like this

1252
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,791
Applications of the thing that you're building

1253
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,351
The underside of the wrist for example

1254
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,375
You know it is

1255
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,935
Super Suds vibration activation

1256
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,495
Even though the resolution is below a light

1257
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,775
Cotswolds

1258
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,055
Send the signal

1259
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,335
Butt on your back

1260
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,615
Act like that sensitivity is it

1261
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,151
There's a lot that's so

1262
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:27,807
Pay attention to what part of the body you're working with and understand the physiology kind of like of that body part that you're working with

1263
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,831
How it responds to touch

1264
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,879
It's kind of like a good first step

1265
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,159
Additionally

1266
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,463
I think the biggest thing is just to kind of go in

1267
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,255
I really have fun with it

1268
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,303
You know like that so much inspiration

1269
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,583
And

1270
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,375
You know this world of

1271
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,399
Using

1272
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,935
A different sense

1273
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:48,031
It's the kind of as a foundation for the work that you want to do any work that you want to explore

1274
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,311
Verity

1275
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,591
Inspiration is that you

1276
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,871
Kind of full from

1277
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
You know like

1278
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,175
Awesome fiction but

1279
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:58,015
And I really kind of like pop culture or just anywhere

1280
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
Tennessee

1281
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,599
What types of things

1282
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,623
You really could

1283
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,903
Be doing

1284
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,439
If you didn't have to

1285
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,719
Look at it or

1286
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
Hear it

1287
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,255
Understand

1288
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
And I think God

1289
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,095
Just kind of being in that space playing in that space

1290
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:15,167
Kind of like documenting kind of what your understanding is

1291
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,703
Because right now I think

1292
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
The other Opera

1293
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,287
90s R&B in the state says that

1294
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,615
We're all trying to figure out how to make us stuff and documents

1295
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,383
Stop

1296
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,967
Write this stuff that we recall haptics with that we're still figuring out

1297
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,015
Right now there aren't really any

1298
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,551
Three platforms that make it simple

1299
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
Or

1300
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,855
These types of possibility

1301
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
Be created

1302
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,647
Bye

1303
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,183
Doctor Who

1304
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,999
Pick it up in the same way you have as Photoshop or illustrator

1305
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,071
And that was like I think there's a huge opportunity

1306
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,095
Anastasis

1307
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,119
Really

1308
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,167
Explore different ways of

1309
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
Howard Dr

1310
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,215
Work

1311
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,495
Answer

1312
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:54,591
Share that work on Sunday with one another so that we can all move that District forward like together

1313
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
I like it

1314
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,943
Quick question for you this is a very practical question but

1315
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,735
You know I'm a very practical person

1316
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:06,111
So there's the way band idea and I think looking at the spec sheet that is probably way out of date

1317
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,391
It was like 3 hour battery

1318
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,975
When I'm thinking about haptics what is that do for battery life

1319
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:17,375
What is that implementation really look like if I'm going to have a phone that communicates to a device or device that I'm in a

1320
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
We're all day

1321
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,935
Navigation purposes

1322
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:26,335
It doesn't really horribly affect battery life vibrating Motors definitely have a drain on battery

1323
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,127
That's pretty clear

1324
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895
But

1325
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,175
The thing is is that like

1326
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:34,527
You're not navigating so much of the day and so while you're out use

1327
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
Device

1328
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,575
The average

1329
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,111
Walker

1330
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,391
Thing is probably about like

1331
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
20

1332
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:43,999
I know usually at that point people using public transportation

1333
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,559
You know like within that kind of a distance

1334
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,095
You're walking like

1335
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,167
Maybe an hour a day maybe two hours a day maximum

1336
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,447
So

1337
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:55,775
The battery life on the device last for days without being charged

1338
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:59,103
True that's a good point probably one of those tips that we should really thing

1339
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,639
Think about like when implementing something

1340
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:07,039
This is really exciting and you guys are going to do a crowdfunding campaign in

1341
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,831
August or September correct

1342
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,879
Yes that's correct

1343
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,415
Tell me more about this campaign

1344
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,743
So in August or September will be watching

1345
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,767
Kickstarter campaign

1346
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,583
I will be delivering the very first playback devices

1347
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,607
To the public

1348
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,143
And so everyone will have enough

1349
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,423
Free water

1350
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,959
I've been based off of those

1351
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,495
Well Manufacturing

1352
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,287
The goal is to deliver the product

1353
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,847
By April of 2020

1354
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,127
Super excited

1355
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,175
Getting everything ready and

1356
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,247
It's a big moment for us. It's just been a long time in the making

1357
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,783
It sounds like it okay

1358
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,855
Well awesome Wilke thanks for coming on the show this week

1359
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:48,255
