00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
I know it's a week late

27
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:41,376
Because we knew the FCC last Thursday was going to vote against

28
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
For repealing

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Neutrality

30
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,264
And see what everybody's hot takes

31
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,104
As someone who's covered this for almost a decade I kind of felt like

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
God is there really anything new to say about

33
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,200
The answer is

34
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
Not

35
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
But

36
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
For people who are wondering

37
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
Net neutrality

38
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,600
I think is important

39
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
To the internet

40
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
Mostly because we don't know yet

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,048
How iot is going to play out in one of the things that I've been thinking a lot about

42
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
Is

43
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,120
In talking to people that keep asking me about

44
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
Low power

45
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
Wide area network

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,568
Soaking cellular companies really screw around with net neutrality if you're working with like nb-iot

47
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Eeyore

00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,616
Cat 1M

49
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,664
Am I answer to this is

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Maybe

51
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,760
And the reason I say this is today these things are low data rate

52
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
Works never

53
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
You can always

54
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,648
Always use more broadband no one has ever said wow

55
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
I have got enough

56
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
And so

57
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:43,072
The things constraining devices on the edge right now are mostly power relay

58
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
And it's

59
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,936
Completely possible that we will have Innovations in the next 10 years it will

60
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,336
Allow us to not have to charge things all the time or change the batteries which then suddenly with all of this power

61
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,152
You can actually leave this on a lot more often

62
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,968
And once things are on you wanted to be communicating

63
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
Which means it's going to consume

64
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
And so

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
This is how I think about

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,856
I look at it as a resource

67
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,904
And right now it's finite because

68
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Power stuff

69
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
The Edge is fine

70
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,256
But if that turns incident or

71
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
Then we're going to want to come inside

72
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
Increase in bandwidth

73
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,448
And that's when we could see carrier start messing around

74
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,264
Data and collinear networks congested

75
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
And all of that fun stuff

76
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,104
Charging people for access to

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Do certain

78
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
In this is where I think

79
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
Don't need net

80
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
Neutrality

81
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,624
I agree with everything you said it's not necessarily a problem right now but it is something we need to be aware of

82
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
For the future

83
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
Because

84
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
Most of these devices are

85
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
Creating small bits of

86
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,120
So it's not like we're pushing gigabytes of video for example of we need enough of a pipe for that

87
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,192
But we probably don't yet know everything that's

88
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
It's going to be connected

89
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,056
And we can't then imagine how much data I think is going to need

90
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
Right so I agree with you

91
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,896
John that is very pragmatic I think about it now

92
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432
The other thing is

93
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,992
Looking at it from stay-at-home perspective

94
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:11,648
What happens when a PSP has its own security system that it sells to customers and you don't want to use

95
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
You want to use your own

96
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:18,815
Morty when he's around Hub instead of their Hub and what if they slow down the Gatorade

97
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
To your Hobbit

98
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,959
Kind of push you towards their product so that to me it's still another problem that this is going to cost

99
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Exactly

100
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
I totally agree

101
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
You're going for immediate issues I'm going

102
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
Essentially

103
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,735
We have to just ask ourselves do you want Broadband to be a scarce resource

104
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:42,367
Which is how the telcos want to create it they wanted to be scarce because then they can charge more

105
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
For it and that they have the

106
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
The power

107
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
Totally rational

108
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
Business perspective

109
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,559
They have adopted a scarcity

110
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,607
Now if you could argue

111
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
And I would argue

112
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,191
The Broadband actually shouldn't be scared

113
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
It is like access to

114
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,335
This is terrible but gasoline and electricity back in the day

115
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,175
And because we had abundant access to those resources

116
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,503
What happened is we built entire new Innovations

117
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
We are reaping the consequences

118
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,623
But we got all the way from

119
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Electricity

120
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
Air conditioning

121
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
Two refrigerators

122
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,535
The frozen dinners to being able to store vaccines I mean

123
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
Look at how

124
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
1

125
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,631
Abundant resource

126
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
Changes the

127
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,519
Just added that picture at this air-conditioning itself is what help

128
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
People

129
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,591
Migrate in the United States down south

130
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Really

131
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,687
I'd like population areas and we created massive cities down there in

132
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
So it's a

133
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
Probably picture stamp

134
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
The impact is huge

135
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
So yes

136
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:50,207
Broadband should be an abundant resource I think we've moved past the time frame when it

137
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Could be scarce

138
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,767
Resource and also look what happened with

139
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:57,631
Cellular carriers I mean remember how is a great example of be texting in Europe

140
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
Versus text

141
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,311
We because texting plans were charged per text we never developed much of a texting culture until they be

142
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Unlimited plans

143
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Where is in Europe

144
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,919
It was actually much cheaper to do that then

145
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Roma data

146
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
So people texted me

147
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,295
Economic incentives are huge

148
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
I think broadband's probably in a place where we will develop around it because we are getting closer with things like 5G and

149
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,767
Buy 5G fixed Wireless over millimeter waves

150
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,095
But it's worth thinking about you guys and

151
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:35,263
It is frustrating My Hope Is that there's two last chances for the repeal to not happen and that is one

152
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,103
Many many states have filed lawsuits to kind of block it

153
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
And to their

154
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:45,247
Could be a congressional review of it as well as which could overturn the passage of it so

155
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,783
Best eyewear We Stand today

156
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,831
And Marsha Blackburn did

157
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
Introduce a bill

158
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,183
It is not a bill that is actually helping

159
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Preserve net neutrality

160
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
It is

161
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Gary Career Center

162
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,631
Keep an eye out for Chuck Schumer a Democrat has said that he will also

163
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
Try to file a bill

164
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,495
So maybe we will see actual Congressional legislation

165
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Around

166
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Net neutrality

167
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,079
Which is a direct result of a lack of broadband

168
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Competition

169
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Now

170
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,711
Let's talk about things that consume a lot of broadband and frankly

171
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
Are tariffs

172
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,599
What is happening as part of a Crackdown in

173
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,135
Dissident activity

174
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
Ivy

175
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
Uyghurs

176
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
In China

177
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
They have

178
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,511
Put digital surveillance systems

179
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,535
With cameras

180
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
Using facial recognition

181
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,375
Addition to track people and then they detain them and

182
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
People disappear

183
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,751
This ties directly into Chinese efforts around

184
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
Lissie when was it

185
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:46,431
Kevin we talked about this earlier it was in China where your

186
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,527
Considered a loyal truthful respectable person versus not

187
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,183
Yes and so this is an example of the power of the Internet of Things used I would argue for

188
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,303
What happens if you do now because of the compute power the sensors and

189
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
Computer vision

190
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,631
We have the capability to track a citizen

191
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
Everywhere they go

192
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Endnote

193
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
Everything they do in

194
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
That

195
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
We have to establish rules are

196
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Because

197
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
My God it's so

198
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
The word

199
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
Severe

200
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
That

201
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
In the article anyway

202
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
They say as soon as you stepped foot in

203
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,319
The city whatever City it is that's under surveillance

204
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
They know you're there

205
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,415
Like almost immediately that's how

206
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
Instantaneous this all is

207
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:35,583
In this implementation you have to engage with these systems to do everything from buying gas to pass

208
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
Not volunteer

209
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
End

210
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
It is not necessarily even

211
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Visible

212
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
To the citizen

213
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
Yeah

214
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,687
It's a long but well worth

215
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Reading article

216
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,807
Rather scary unfortunately for the IT industry

217
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:00,927
This is going to be another one of those horror stories of people say this is why we shouldn't have everything connected

218
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
That's unfortunate

219
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,999
But I can understand why people would say that

220
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,679
What a downer show what a downer show this is yesterday Facebook

221
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,495
Our government is creating a database of faces

222
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
As part of

223
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
New license

224
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,103
Shepherd so the FBI now has a database of it

225
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,431
Many people's faces because of new state licenses

226
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
Driver's licenses

227
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Now

228
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,551
What is also interesting in parallel to any state

229
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
Efforts we have

230
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Facebook

231
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647
Which just announced this week

232
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
That they can

233
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,231
Recognize you in pictures and

234
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,303
They will send you an e-mail when you appear even if you are

235
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
Which many people will be like

236
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,935
That's nice because sometimes I just don't

237
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,031
Me to find the victim of stalking even if I'm not tagged I want my picture off Facebook

238
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,383
What is scary as all get-out is Facebook nose

239
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Who many people

240
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,687
Pilar

241
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
That is also

242
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
Quite scary

243
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,599
Facebook is not using this necessarily to Tamp down religious beliefs but

244
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Start in town

245
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,951
State activism but you know it could be an agent

246
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
On behalf of a government if it wants to work

247
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
Country okay

248
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:15,935
The scary part is and I have long been a Facebook user so you know I'm I'm guilty as well

249
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,239
We've been providing

250
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
Facebook the smarts the data itself

251
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
I previously tagging people

252
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,407
Right it's to the point now where it's recognizing

253
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
Yeah my wife isn't it

254
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,271
Picture and you know it's just kind of our own fault

255
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
It is

256
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
But I would say

257
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,367
Facebook is providing one thing

258
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,927
Community whatever

259
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,487
When it's actually monetizing

260
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,767
Building a business

261
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
I'm completely

262
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,119
And that's actually a really interesting element

263
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Wishing this

264
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,799
They're usually do lames in any product so a product

265
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
Invisible Hardware

266
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
Consumer perspective is trying to serve you by offering

267
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
Who sings but you are

268
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Also

269
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Helping

270
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
The development of that product

271
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
And you may not understand exact

272
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
And that doesn't have to be bad

273
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
It doesn't have to be

274
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,951
Evil and it's not clear

275
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,511
There's a lot of distress right now for Facebook

276
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303
They're not picking up

277
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,655
You know dissidence off the street and putting them in prison or killing them so

278
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Cello bar

279
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:27,615
But they're building the tools and supporting the tools that they could be used to do that by somebody else

280
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
That's computer vision

281
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,479
It's something we really need to start talking about

282
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
About and we need to talk about it specifically

283
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
Around these issues

284
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,111
Also data correlation

285
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,159
Once we have all this crazy data

286
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
Computers once I can see more things

287
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
They can

288
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,791
Amass a lot more data

289
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,607
Wish that can be searched and correlated very quickly

290
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,911
And that is a powerful thing I think we have

291
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
Another example of that is Google Street View

292
00:11:54,751 --> 00:12:00,127
Apparently now Google Street View can determine how areas vote based on the cars that are

293
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
Yeah it's

294
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:08,319
I read through this article is very interesting and it's not facial recognition but still recognition of something about people

295
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Their choice of vehicle

296
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
You know and then

297
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
Basically using the data

298
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,999
From the street view car as I drive around seeing which vehicles cars trucks

299
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
Etc are in a neighborhood

300
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:22,655
They can pretty much estimate if they lean left or right in the u.s. democrat-republican Etc

301
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,447
And it's uncannily accurate

302
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,799
Yes and this isn't actually all that new like there's been surveys in the past likes

303
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
Democrats drive Subaru

304
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
In general

305
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,199
So Republicans generally drive pickup trucks and we can actually

306
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
That is not a crazy

307
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Correlation to make

308
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,599
Maybe not 100% accurate at the individual level but at the broad level

309
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
It is in

310
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
So this is just basically

311
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
Pulling this data

312
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
At a massive level

313
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
Correlating it and then

314
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Sending out

315
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
Useful insight

316
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Siri

317
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
All right let's do something a little less distant

318
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,775
Where did he born

319
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
And

320
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,943
Iota Iota which you've written about blockchain many many times for the past several years so you are probably soon

321
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,807
I know you're with Iota I was not until very recently because I start a little altar

322
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
Coin investment strategy just for fun

323
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
Tell me to disclose that actually own

324
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,999
.025 5 Iota tokens right now

325
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
Which is worth next to nothing but

326
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,607
By investing in it I learned that

327
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:29,727
It's rather interesting use of blockchain because it's device-to-device transactions worth

328
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
With

329
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,079
Currency all currency that uses blockchain is typically

330
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
People transaction

331
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,943
Buying something for somebody your exchanging currency at cetera

332
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,807
But this is device-to-device so this is like the blockchain for IRT apparently it's

333
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
Stun over 10 billion dollars worth of

334
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,183
Transactions already so I did not know about it but it

335
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:55,583
Been around for a couple years now and recently they just earlier this week rather Robert Bosch venture capital

336
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,423
Invested I don't know how much but invested enough to make news

337
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,959
In Iota token so

338
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:06,591
An example of how Iota would work would be power a car with a ton of sleep

339
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
Pay for Town parking

340
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:13,247
So take our two parking meter transaction for example that would use the Iota blockchain and

341
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
No human interaction needed so it's something that I'm looking into a little further but against a so you probably heard this

342
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
Before I have

343
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
No

344
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
What's interesting is I've written about

345
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
There are two things that are really great about

346
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
Just probably the black sheep

347
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
Wishes that it's distributed

348
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
Countability so

349
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,567
The distributed nature of it is scalable which is awesome for iot

350
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Trillian

351
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,895
Billions of sensors

352
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:45,247
And the accountability is good because I passed her security and Trust which is important

353
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
Things like Mike

354
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,855
So is far back is like 2014 I've been

355
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Talking to people

356
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Like IBM

357
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
7 Samsung

358
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
About

359
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
How to develop

360
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,023
Blockchain based Technologies for

361
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Device to device

362
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
Microtrans

363
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
Actions

364
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,399
And IBM had a platform for this

365
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,215
I think it went anywhere but it is part of

366
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
That demo that you saw her

367
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
The parking

368
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
It's also things like your washing machine

369
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Initially

370
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,663
At CES in nice

371
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,015
2015 Samsung and IBM shut off a washing machine that can order its own detergent

372
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
Based on their

373
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
Technology they're watching

374
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Which was not

375
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
There's also a network

376
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
Company called filament

377
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,231
They're using it to share data

378
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
Cross very small

379
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
Proprietary Wireless net

380
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
It works and they do it

381
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,887
As a way to

382
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
Distribute

383
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
Signals when there's no cellular

384
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,775
There's also a security company for the industrial

385
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,847
She called sage that I wrote about this week they're using the blockchain to track

386
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
Data requests across the system

387
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
And then there's an algorithm called

388
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
Shamir's secret sharing

389
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,575
And that is another distributed way to scatter data and then reconstructed

390
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Set from different now

391
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Notes

392
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
What's important to note

393
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,231
For any of these to be useful these blockchain-based kind of Micro Center

394
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
Security whatever

395
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
You need to combine the blockchain

396
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,607
And there's various forms of that iota

397
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
Bitcoin ethereum

398
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Whatever

399
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
With other technology

400
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,287
You just can't just be like black magic

401
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
File transfer

402
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
Yeah you need

403
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
No it's eating people verified

404
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:25,599
Directions and keeping track of things and misses what the miners are doing when they're mining for Bitcoin for example their cream

405
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
Reading more blocks

406
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
On the chain

407
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
Or verifying am I

408
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
I should say it's more technically accurate

409
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,743
And you have to pay them

410
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Because

411
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,095
They're using their electricity Computing time so

412
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
It's a whole infrastructure needs to be built

413
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,447
Nachos you can decide use blockchain

414
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
Well so some of them are

415
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
And I guess

416
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
Iota works that way

417
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,847
Some of them are actually

418
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,407
Like hyperledger is actually internal to a

419
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,223
So these standards are the company can develop in

420
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Control

421
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
The issuance of Tokyo

422
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,575
Because they don't want actually

423
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
External

424
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,415
Different ways of doing

425
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
And I was actually just tell you about the tech

426
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
This happened

427
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,351
That's basically

428
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,655
Kids keeping a record of something happening

429
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
So

430
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,263
There's a lot here in this was kind of maybe not the world's best over

431
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,359
I have long believed that watching has an important role to play

432
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
And IRT

433
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
And I have kept an eye on iota

434
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,479
And now that Kevin's invested High

435
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
Ask him all my questions

436
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
I think it's worth $0.07.

437
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
All right he's not quitting his day job

438
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Or his

439
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Wednesday morning Joe

440
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,791
Okay let's move on to some news

441
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
Let's do this really quickly so

442
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
People really like the echo spot

443
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:48,287
Echo spot is the hundred and $29 camera I don't know what it is right now cuz Amazon probably has a smoking hot deal ahead of the house

444
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
This is a tiny little

445
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,919
Screen that shows you what the weather in a clock face

446
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,991
Curly videos but not yet YouTube videos

447
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
Nope

448
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,343
Don't take that show Amazon Prime video

449
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
Yes

450
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
In IMG

451
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,207
Surprised because I would never want

452
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
A camera

453
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
Because this thing has

454
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
By my bed

455
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,583
Well I'm in the bed

456
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,983
Inside is a good place for a device like this yes so the camera is an issue there I mean you could have this

457
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,543
Maybe in your kitchen or somewhere else it would be okay

458
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
There we go

459
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,711
This is a round 2.5 inch display and

460
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:33,599
Amazon is touting it as hell you can watch Amazon video on it or you can view your webcam and so on so forth

461
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,695
I just don't see the point of that on a 2.5 inch display but

462
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,559
Chances are you have another better display for that you had your phone in your hand which has a

463
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,607
456 inch display

464
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,399
Maybe you bought the show

465
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,679
Video of tablets

466
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Around the house

467
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,263
Tell me this is more of a solution

468
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
Persuasion

469
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,615
Yes I do

470
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
Let's give that to him

471
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
And

472
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Blink

473
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
The maker of a

474
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
Smart home camera that we talked about

475
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,831
They have created a $99 video

476
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
Doorbell and

477
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:10,719
This is part of this influx of Cheaper Gadget so we talked about the wise camera that was

478
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,071
Matthew 13

479
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:20,191
Basically the doorbell will cost you $99 or $129 if

480
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:24,799
If you need to Blink sync module so I don't have a lot to say about this people seem like

481
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
It's a

482
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
Good

483
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Deal

484
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
Everybody has a doorbell

485
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,479
Typically they've been priced at 2:50 or $200

486
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,039
So this actually really is going to put a lot of pressure

487
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
Ring skybell

488
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
August

489
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Nest

490
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,903
Who's got a Toradol coming out

491
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
But worth looking at

492
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:46,815
People apparently it's got a live video stream motion sensor two-way audio and night vision

493
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
And it can't run

494
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,143
On batteries or

495
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,727
Two Double AA lithium batteries or you can hardwire

496
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,519
So it's pretty awesome

497
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,847
Actually yeah I know it's got all the features that most of the other

498
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
Smart doorbell

499
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,431
Cameras have and it is at least half the

500
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:08,319
Price so you're right it's going to put pressure on the other folks maybe they'll say we've got a better service or

501
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:14,719
Peanut because lotteries have monitoring plans and so on so forth capturing the data saved in the cloud making clips and all that will have to see but

502
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,351
That's your right is going to put pressure on it reveals

503
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Is a strong

504
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
All right

505
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
So that is available

506
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
Pre-order

507
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
I want that chicken

508
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:31,359
Electricity consumption of iot devices I'm putting this in the panic

509
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
Except

510
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
There is a

511
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Computing cost for

512
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
Listen we should pay attention

513
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:42,111
So the communications industry could use 20% of all the world's electricity by 2025 according to

514
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
To a nuke

515
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,183
Paper by us researchers

516
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,743
It is not yet published but this is from the guardian

517
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
They think that

518
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:55,423
Information and communication technology ICT to create up to 3.5% of global emissions by 22

519
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,983
20 surpassing Aviation and shipping

520
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Is huge

521
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
That is

522
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
That is

523
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
The

524
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,431
Global Computing demand from Smart TV surveillance cameras video streaming

525
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,503
Blah blah blah is increasing by 20%

526
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
A year

527
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,855
And just to add to this one because we talked about blockchain earlier in the show

528
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:18,464
I haven't seen a different article that said blockchain mining right now is

529
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Do you think

530
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
More electricity than five

531
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,816
Nations in their small

532
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
They're not dirty

533
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:33,568
Totally understand that but still it's a scary Prospect me start thinking about how much juice is being used in the emission

534
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
Airport

535
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,432
Okay we also have news for wink

536
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
And sodas lovers

537
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Which is

538
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Me

539
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,808
Kevin yes now works with

540
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
WIC

541
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
And Kevin

542
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Tell us lyrics

543
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:52,768
Yeah it works really well I mean it just like any other connected device in your wake up it will appear once you're at it

544
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
And then you can create

545
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,168
Triggers and robots and things like I said a robot up that when I come to my office at night and

546
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,008
Voice control my lights turn the lights on that the Sonos automatically plays

547
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,848
What turns into one of my favorite XM radio channels and just starts playing

548
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:12,224
So I don't know we had a question on the voicemail couple months back about somebody wanting to do something similar

549
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,856
When she walk into her house she want her son us to start playing well you could do that now if you had the right locking

550
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,648
Dwayne can do it

551
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
She had the August lock

552
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,488
Which means that she actually could

553
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
Now integrated with wink

554
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,560
And have herself

555
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,656
So there you go yay technology will provide

556
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:35,776
Let me ask you because most of my Sonos Integrations only play like a favorite station

557
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
I assume

558
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
You have to set

559
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,616
Does it automatically play

560
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,944
Just whatever the default favorite is or can you set a favor

561
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,272
You can set a favorite for that robot

562
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
Let's move on

563
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,208
Question Public Service answering mood answer

564
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,512
A question from The Internet of Things

565
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
Hotspot

566
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:02,912
The iot podcast listener is brought to you by Schlage maker of electronic lock

567

Schlage smart locks work with most Smart Home & Security system so you can get the most out of your lock

568
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:13,408
Whether you're an Apple homekit user or love Madam a to see what's possible

569
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
Dot-com

570
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
Hi Stacy

571
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Kevin

572
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Angeles

573
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
Love your show

574
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,344
The only podcast I listen

575
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
Religiously

576
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
Here's my question

577
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,184
And please forgive me a

578
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,768
I've got a tiny apartment in LA with

579
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
100 square foot

580
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,376
That's far it's outfitted with Hue lighting

581
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,192
And WeMo smart plugs and switches

582
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,496
Which I control via no less than

583
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,288
Three Google home devices

584
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,824
Occasionally enamel

585
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
Yes there are really

586
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
This mini digital assistant

587
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,456
In my small space

588
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
Everything is integrated and occasionally alternate

589
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,832
To ask for stringify to fill in the gaps

590
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
My question is this

591
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,928
What would the advantage

592
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
Set up a Smart Hub

593
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
Be in my setup

594
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
If any

595
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,816
Is it just a matter of

596
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
Speed

597
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
That is rude

598
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Reducing latency

599
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,168
She or are there other benefits

600
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,704
Smart home hub I should get

601
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,800
At this juncture I don't see the necessity of one

602
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
Hoping you can shut

603
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
For me

604
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
Thanks in advance

605
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
Happiest

606
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Holidays today

607
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,248
Okay Chris that is an excellent

608
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
Question

609
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
It's at

610
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,112
It is so good that I'm going to tell you you don't actually need

611
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
Itsmarta

612
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,160
If you are content

613
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,208
What's your setup do not bring in

614
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,536
More devices more complexity and above all more hubs

615
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:39,680
The only reason I would do it if I were you is if I wanted to do something with sensors because hubs will open the wide world

616
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,752
Have sensors so if you want to automate your lights

617
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,056
And have them turn on would like a closet door

618
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,872
Opens for if you want a temperature

619
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
Change to set something up

620
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Ascent

621
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
You would need a hug

622
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,808
Yeah I just I literally just had this conversation with a neighbor the other day

623
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
And

624
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:00,160
He was wondering why some things he could control through his Echo

625
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,696
Where is other things he couldn't

626
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,536
And I said we got to have a hug for certain things so

627
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:10,912
Going to your point Stacy if you're going to add other things such as sensors or maybe a smart door lock

628
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,984
What you want to simplify and there's nothing wrong with

629
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
Iftin

630
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
Stringify

631
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,824
If you want to just do it in one app

632
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,384
You get an app with your hug when you can

633
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
Create your automations that way

634
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
So

635
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,272
I agree it's probably not necessary unless you're going to add more things

636
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:31,392
Okay now if you want to play and go a little nuts

637
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
Go right ahead

638
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,952
It might be a question is Chris

639
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,000
Why do you have so many smartass

640
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
In your eyes

641
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,912
That's more smart assistance per square foot than I've ever heard I'm impressed

642
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
All right that rounds out the news portion of Today Show

Everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

662
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:46,144
This is your house Stacey Higginbotham and I am here with Janice Psy

663
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
Who is a research scientist

664
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,728
With Mozilla

665
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
Hi Janice how are you doing

666
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
Thanks for having me on

667
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,872
I am super excited so you

668
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,408
Are a human

669
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
Computer

670
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
Interaction

671
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
Research scientist specifically

672
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,040
Specifically

673
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,112
What's called usable privacy and this means

674
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,160
Privacy and how people interact with things

675
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,072
Got it this is going to be a fun conversation because

676
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,912
In general I feel like The Internet of Things is a privacy nightmare

677
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
It's not even waiting

678
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
And it is

679
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
Right now

680
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,800
So in terms of privacy

681
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,080
It's one of these things that she

682
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,408
Really difficult right cuz like when you are trying to go out

683
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
Buy some connected

684
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
Device

685
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,272
It's probably because you have some kind of use case

686
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,808
Like you want to make it

687
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,112
Easier to turn your lights on

688
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
Control your thermostat

689
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,720
From upstairs but having to come back downstairs

690
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,792
So usually there's a reason why

691
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,352
People want to buy a bunch of connected things

692
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
And

693
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
Trying to figure out

694
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,960
The Privacy that goes along with it is pretty much a

695
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
Because right now we have

696
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
What kind of a legal regime

697
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
For privacy in the United States

698
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,384
Space

699
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,432
And so the way this works is

700
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,992
If a company posts a privacy policy

701
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,784
At three matches all they really have

702
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,856
Legal perspective

703
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,672
Government normal person perspective

704
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,464
We know that no one reads privacy

705
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,912
Trying to even decipher or understand anything about leaving

706
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
Did the Bison

707
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728
What is connected to the internet

708
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,520
You know where it's going and who's using it

709
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,568
So the way I view

710
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,616
Privacy is really looking at

711
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,920
How can you explain things

712
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
Normal people

713
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,528
Can understand and then make decisions

714
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,136
Where's relevant in context

715
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:47,744
And actually have some real control over your data and

716
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,888
Space

717
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,448
Okay so let's

718
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,472
Dive Right In

719
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,752
With the big challenge

720
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
Because

721
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,568
I think you did a good job explaining like

722
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,360
Oh my gosh if I'm buying a Kinect

723
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:08,736
The thermostat and I'm going to see that notice and consent thing on the thermostat which is a terrible place to read 40

724
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
Is right

725
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,576
It's also I think

726
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,392
You hit on something a little bit more subtle witches

727
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,696
If you're buying these things in their use case to

728
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Dependent

729
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,792
The Privacy impact of it may depend on

730
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,376
That particular use case like I may not mind

731
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,168
The company that makes

732
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,216
My light switch knowing that I got up and

733
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,008
Turn off the lights at 8 at night

734
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:35,360
But then there's another layer to that which is if I connect that light switch to light

735
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,384
My garage door

736
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,920
Then that company

737
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,224
I might also know when I've actually left

738
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
My house

739
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
There is this concept

740
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:49,184
I guess it's a changing use case as you connect more devices this sort of

741
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
Privacy in the

742
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
Data that's available to pee

743
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
People about you be

744
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
Becomes a lot

745
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,352
I'm curious what you're thinking about

746
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
How to deal with

747
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
Yes

748
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
You're absolutely right

749
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,776
He's just having one single data point like light switch on

750
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:09,408
In the whole ocean of data that's available but that's not

751
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
Usually the goal

752
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:13,504
The goal of most companies as well as

753
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,344
Everything else that you are interacting with in terms of the iot platform

754
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,136
The gold companies

755
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
Typically class

756
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,440
Information

757
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,464
Overtime

758
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,536
Bacon do fancy machine learning things

759
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
Nowadays

760
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
Remove docker from Jessie

761
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Having

762
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,704
Now everything is artificial intelligence

763
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,728
And so

764
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264
But they do that's collected

765
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,568
You may think it's pretty innocuous

766
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:41,920
Or low risk

767
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,480
Combining

768
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
Aldi's differ

769
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
Sources of data

770
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,600
That begins to help other people

771
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
Accompanies developer really

772
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:55,488
Detail picture of the going-ons inside of your house

773
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
Right now consumers are worried about the

774
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,304
Their privacy

775
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,096
Why do companies

776
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
Wanted

777
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
Information

778
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,168
There's a couple goals

779
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
What are the goals obviously

780
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
Is make money

781
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,520
By either selling more products

782
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,056
Or selling services

783
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,360
To go along with your product

784
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,408
For example if you have an S

785
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,224
Ask him if you want to save your videos

786
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,504
And you have to subscribe

787
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
That you have data storage

788
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
Further down like

789
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,880
Bigger picture

790
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
Issue is

791
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:27,744
Making money through being able to profile you and or sell you

792
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,304
And I think it's a lot of data

793
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
Now is

794
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,376
It's kind of based on a

795
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
Hope in a

796
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:39,008
Figure out some cool things to do with it later

797
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,336
And that's kind of like the worst way to have dinner

798
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,384
You don't have a specific goal

799
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,432
Is just by collecting a lot of it and

800
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
Get around

801
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
That's where you open

802
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,784
Companies open themselves up to a lot of risk

803
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,112
Because everyone has data breaches all the time

804
00:31:54,368 --> 00:32:00,512
As a counter argument to that a lot of the current advances in machine learning

805
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Been made

806
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:06,400
One because hey we got more powerful in a parallel processing in gpus but two

807
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,704
Because we have a lot of this data of

808
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
Available

809
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:13,056
And so in some sense and I'm curious what happened

810
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
Pens as we

811
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,384
Double down on AI and machine

812
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,176
As we definitely are

813
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,480
Does that kind of outweigh the need for

814
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,248
Privacy

815
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,160
I feel like there's a lot of things that you can do to be a responsible

816
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Company

817
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
In terms of the day

818
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,768
And then you could have mentioned some of it now

819
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,048
You mentioned the word

820
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
Right now I think it's a matter of

821
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
How did is

822
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,144
Win tickets to words

823
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
And

824
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,704
What is attached along

825
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
Cheetah

826
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:47,872
And a lot of companies are working really hard at figuring out ways the kind of still take advantage of collecting lots of date

827
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
Doing

828
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,968
Either transforming it slightly

829
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
With mathematical methods

830
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
White differential privacy

831
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,648
The kind of guarantee you a little bit more

832
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,184
And also still being used

833
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,512
So if I am a company striving to

834
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,536
Napa evolve

835
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
For example

836
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
How should I

837
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,680
I think you should first of all have a good understanding of

838
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,216
What you want to do with the data

839
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,288
And the ones you collected figure out what needs to be

840
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
Stewart

841
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
In terms of

842
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
From an identifiable person

843
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,176
My Windows machine

844
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,736
Is Sunday at 2

845
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,040
And that is usually attached with

846
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:31,136
Several really unique identifiers like a machine ID your device ID

847
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,440
Along with save my IP address

848
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
And so

849
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,328
When the things that companies can do is decide how much of a story

850
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,400
Jenna specifically

851
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,960
Or just someone in the Pacific Northwest

852
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,496
Is using a computer

853
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,288
And be able to start

854
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,848
Lopping off the data that isn't needed

855
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,408
And you mentioned things like differential privacy

856
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,456
What are ways that companies

857
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,064
Treatdata respectfully and still have it retain it

858
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,368
I think that's one thing that's really important

859
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,672
Is for companies to really kind of

860
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,976
Treat their own responsible did he use

861
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
Policies inside the company

862
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,304
This is kind of separate from

863
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
Differential privacy

864
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
It's being able to have

865
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,192
Methods and systems in place

866
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
Attract

867
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,544
Does it have audit mechanisms

868
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
So bad

869
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,152
People can't access the other not supposed to have access to

870
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,480
Or if they are and it's kind of

871
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
How many companies

872
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,624
Play they're doing it more and more now

873
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
Thank you

874
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,512
From years and years ago there was news about people searching for likes

875
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,560
Celebrity taking Ubers

876
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:48,960
Or someone like Britney Spears going to the hospital and people within the hospital system

877
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
Funny people

878
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:54,336
People who are it system administrators are more of these issues

879
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
And they have

880
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,920
Probably done more in terms of access controls

881
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,296
Here comes a challenge cuz I talk to people about connected devices all the time

882
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
In private

883
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,600
How do you communicate

884
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,392
Good data practices

885
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,672
What matters

886
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
And all of that

887
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,536
To Consumers and maybe we should even start that with like my God which is

888
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
Primary things a consumer should

889
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
Care about with Rick

890
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
Let me think about this

891
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
And I think that we

892
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,496
We need to have a whole bunch of different

893
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,264
Ways to Die

894
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:27,616
If I were to go to Home Depot right now and I want to buy a Kinect

895
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,920
Probably half a dozen

896
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,504
People are companies are manufacturers offering things now

897
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,552
But there's nothing that packages

898
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,088
Unpackaging

899
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,368
For any of these products

900
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
That actually says

901
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,184
Anything about the date

902
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,000
Right and so there needs to be something that's

903
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,048
Imagine all the different points

904
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
Upsell

905
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,400
Physical packaging or

906
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,448
When you go to Amazon

907
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,496
There's some kind of disclosure around

908
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,544
Hey you either need an app

909
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,104
Or we're going to share data with

910
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,152
This many companies are these types of come

911
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,224
Some kind of nutrition label

912
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,528
Provide some

913
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
Let's talk about you

914
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,624
Because you guys did for the holidays

915
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
Of things

916
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,440
Well may or may not

917
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,488
Tweaker date not leak your data cuz it's not

918
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,024
Kits and intend

919
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
Sharing

920
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,632
Intentional and unintentional

921
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
So talk to me about this

922
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,984
Sure so we created this guy again

923
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,824
50

924
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,664
The kind of their permissions

925
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,688
That would be

926
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
Whether they act

927
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,552
Or your microphone or track your GPS location

928
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,088
And it also kind of

929
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,160
Did a little investigating whether you had what kind of

930
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,440
Information about

931
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,000
Whether it requires you to create an account

932
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,304
Or if you have any privacy control

933
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,096
Or she could delete your data later

934
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,144
And when the kind of the funny thing

935
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
Things about

936
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,472
We're not funny but tricky things about connected things

937
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
Is that

938
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,776
Everything isn't just

939
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
The most obvious

940
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,104
When I buy a rubber duck

941
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,152
That is called

942
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,944
What is a connected rubber ducky

943
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
Please music in his LED

944
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,784
It's not just

945
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,600
Cuz you're also usually have to interact with

946
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,416
To get your thing to work

947
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,696
I had to download an app

948
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,232
I kind of said everything

949
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,768
So you have to think about

950
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
Device

951
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,376
Which I hadn't really thought about

952
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,936
And each of these things

953
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,544
Bye-bye Dropcam

954
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,384
The camera on the outside of my house

955
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,712
It's obvious that hey it's probably record video cuz I just bought it

956
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,552
But when you're buying like a

957
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,112
No electric toothbrush and you have to use the app

958
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,160
It might be weird or kind of like

959
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,952
Not really make sense why

960
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,232
Collecting your GPS

961
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,768
Location information

962
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,656
GPS information to use the app

963
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
Pastor askew

964
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,752
And I don't understand why he needs

965
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,592
In some of these cases you can just not

966
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:10,688
Say yo

967
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,296
But in some cases you can't and that actually brings us up to a really good

968
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,832
Kid point which is

969
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,392
A lot of these things you have to purchase it

970
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,928
To find out that it's going to

971
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,464
Have objections all data

972
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,584
And that feels terrible because sometimes

973
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
Can you return it

974
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,888
What is that sort of

975
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,168
Consumer rights issues

976
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
Army figure

977
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,104
You're the only person who's talking about this

978
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
Because

979
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,152
You just don't know

980
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,712
Until you get home and you open it and send oculi

981
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,504
Why is my thermometer

982
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
Reply

983
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,344
Be right back by that time it's too late

984
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:56,256
Unpackaged giving it away is a holiday or birthday present

985
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
5 year old child

986
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,840
I want to take your present away from you

987
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,912
That's hardcore

988
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:08,032
Because in 10 years time he don't want those naked pictures of you in the bathtub going anywhere I promise

989
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,128
I need one good thing though that people do do now

990
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,200
I think a lot of people do they look things up online

991
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,760
Or they look through lots of different reviews like

992
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,808
You know the ratings for everything

993
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,392
Maybe this is a called that two people who really like doing product review

994
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,208
But when you are reviewing something

995
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,048
Somewhere else that you can

996
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
Something about her

997
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,680
I returned this because it was really weird that I was taking my picture all the time

998
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,728
Words of advice for

999
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
For people who are like

1000
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
Man

1001
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,592
I really think a lot of this like I'd love to turn off my lights from

1002
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,872
Using my voice for my cat

1003
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,176
Do you think they should buy into this

1004
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:46,944
Switch they look

1005
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
Or if they

1006
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
When you are making a purchase

1007
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,832
Just spend some time going to

1008
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,624
Through all the settings and controls

1009
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,648
And the permission

1010
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,464
And just turn off the things that you don't think

1011
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,304
For example on the rubber ducky if you don't want to

1012
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,328
Have your location

1013
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,864
Turn off the location permission

1014
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,400
Ender settings

1015
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,472
And sometimes our settings are in the actual

1016
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
Like system settings

1017
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,800
And sometimes those settings are in

1018
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,384
So just check out both areas

1019
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,456
But if we can just do it once

1020
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:23,552
When you're for sitting up your device or a port or what not

1021
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:28,416
There's other simple things that you can do like a lot of people put tape over their webcam

1022
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,440
Laptop

1023
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:34,304
So if there's something physical that you can do to like or unplug your Echo

1024
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,584
If you want to go ahead

1025
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
Try that

1026
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
But check out settings

1027
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,680
And

1028
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,472
I really hope

1029
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,752
And thought that

1030
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,336
The state of privacy would be a little bit better than where it was

1031
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,360
Currently

1032
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
In terms of

1033
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,176
The iot connected things

1034
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,224
Most things did not have any privacy

1035
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Controls

1036
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
Mustangs

1037
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
We're very opaque

1038
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,624
In terms of what data was being sent when

1039
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,904
For what purpose in hell

1040
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,696
And so I think that

1041
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
Still have to be a lot of

1042
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
Work.

1043
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,608
Before things are really

1044
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,680
I think

1045
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,472
There's a lot of really interesting things

1046
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
Special 2018

1047
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
Is the gdpr

1048
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,152
Are these new privacy regulations that come online

1049
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,968
As a result of his privacy regulation

1050
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,552
Regulators are going to start just going after

1051
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,160
In terms of their data collection their transparency

1052
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
Where do you sing it now

1053
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,048
With regulators and the really big tech companies

1054
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,376
And I think that it will just get more and more interesting

1055
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,800
Okay so I'm going to go down a list of popular iot device

1056
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,080
And you can tell me

1057
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,128
Would you put this in your house or no

1058
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
How's that for

1059
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,015
Your own personal like utility like

1060
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,807
Is it going to be valuable to you

1061
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,575
It is there's a

1062
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,391
You just tell me so here we go

1063
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,415
Connected light bulbs

1064
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,535
And I feel perfectly capable of

1065
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,815
Turn on the switch

1066
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,351
Also

1067
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,911
Want to make sure I get light bulbs that last long

1068
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,495
So anything that requires firmware updates

1069
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
I probably try to avoid

1070
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,615
Especially because typically really high in the ceiling

1071
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,407
Okay

1072
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,687
Connect two thermostats

1073
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,039
Programmable

1074
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,879
Pretty happy with just setting the different times on it

1075
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
Daniel Lee

1076
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,231
What to see how cold my house is

1077
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,535
Any particular time when I'm not home

1078
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
Smart door locks

1079
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,119
No

1080
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,911
Smart

1081
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,495
But I would get one of the ones where you can type in a code

1082
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
Okay

1083
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,311
Not have it connected to this

1084
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,615
Okay what about a connected doorbell

1085
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,919
I probably wouldn't get that

1086
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,247
How about outdoor cameras

1087
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,039
Yes I would get outdoor cam

1088
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,319
Indoor cameras

1089
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
No I would not get into

1090
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,671
A smart speaker like an Amazon Echo

1091
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Google home

1092
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
I would but I have no eyes

1093
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:17,631
I unplug it or my husband unplugged it when we're not actively used

1094
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,191
What about Seth

1095
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,727
That he's concerned about it like

1096
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,055
It comes on randomly

1097
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,359
About Alexa

1098
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:31,199
Talking to you

1099
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,735
We don't say her name on

1100
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
On the show

1101
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
For that reason

1102
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,319
Yeah connected toys

1103
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,623
Like your boyfriend Edwin

1104
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,159
I probably wouldn't get

1105
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,975
Connected toy that wasn't

1106
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,255
The purpose

1107
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,791
If you didn't have like a real Beast

1108
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,095
Nintendo switch

1109
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,631
I want that connect

1110
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,679
Into the internet so I can save my progress

1111
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,959
Hi scores

1112
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,543
But for other things like rubber duckies or

1113
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,359
Or other things

1114
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,639
Probably not get the

1115
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,967
Because things get destroyed

1116
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
Fair

1117
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
