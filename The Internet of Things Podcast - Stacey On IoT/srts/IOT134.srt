Security

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,224
We talkin about

00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,816
We've got some data on the Smart Home

17
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,584
A split

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
From Honeywell

19
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:40,192
And I've tested The Madam a voice recognition

20
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,216
Multiple users

21
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,240
I'll tell you what I think

22
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,544
Plus we in partnership with you

23
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
Have

00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,384
Come up with a bunch of

25
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
Yay

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
So stay tuned for that

27

Lower Colorado River Authority

33
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,232
If you guys are going well

34
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,024
He talks about what it's like

35
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,792
To have

36
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,584
800 miles of river

37
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
Covered by flood Center

38
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,936
This is a big deal especially post-hurricane

39
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,216
Steve Harvey so

40
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
We find out

41
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
Were there

42
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
And now

43
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,080

00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,688
Check it out

61
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
Enough

62
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
Let's talk about

63
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
Iraq

64
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,880
The show is on crack

65
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
All right

66
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,816
So the two a vulnerability discovered

67
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,352
Wifi

68
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
Just

69
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
Wi-Fi

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
All of it

71
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
All of life I-80

72
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
Major

73
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,544
Protocol breach

74
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
4

75
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,360
WPA2

76
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,152
Yes which is a security standard

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
802. 11n

78
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
The problem is

79
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
In the

80
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
Handshake so what happens is during

81
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
Handshake

82
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Someone who

83
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Who wants to

84
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
You can basically

85
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Reset

86
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
So they can go

87
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
And there's lots of

88
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
Technical stuff here in a

89
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
If you really want that working

90
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
Link to that mashona

91
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
But the bottom line

92
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,960
Is basically anything that uses

93
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Wi-Fi

94
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,032
And follows the Wi-Fi protocol

95
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
There traffic can now be

96
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:31,712
Bright and granted we're talk about Wi-Fi so this is any potential attacks or X

97
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:36,064
Exploits would have to happen within range of your wireless network so it's not a remote type

98
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
Attack

99
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
Russian

100
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
But

101
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,952
For any of us who remember

102
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
Are the birth of Wi-Fi

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,024
We're driving and driving around

104
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Checking out

105
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,608
So I remember

106
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,424
Having someone I've had someone try to attack my

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Wi-Fi network

108
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
My house

109
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
Registering a Brute Force attack

110
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
After they get the handshake

111
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,104
And they managed to get that data by sitting

112
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,664
Actually on the street behind my house

113
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
And using a

114
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
Antenna

115
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
So

116
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Is this

117
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
A great attack

118
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:13,952
Back from a scalability perspective but if you have a creepy technically Savvy neighbor who wants to get naked

119
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
Get pictures from your webcam

120
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
Might happen

121
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
I can't believe I thought of that

122
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
Okay

123
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,679
So for all of you guys were like Oh Stacy that's awful

124
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
What do we do

125
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
I need it really bad

126
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,871
You actually have to update both your router and the client side of eye

127
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,431
Paises earlier on it look like maybe wouldn't have to

128
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Update

129
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
But Kevin and I

130
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
Octopus

131
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
And we talked to some security

132
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
To err on the side of safety

133
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,583
Yeah yeah I'm always hoping I could just update my router I have a Google Wi-Fi router I'm thinking okay we'll

134
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,375
No Google is one of the many companies

135
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,447
That was notified about this back in August and they're working on a patch

136
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
But that's not going to cut it it

137
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:03,871
It's going to have to be client-side devices to so when Google does its patch the routers

138
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Best Android phones

139
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,015
And that's going to be a tough update to get to every single phone for them because

140
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:16,415
It may depend on if they can push it directly or they have to go through carriers around the world and so on so forth but that's just one particular

141
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Instance

142
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
I'm more concerned about and I think

143
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,535
Our listeners are probably more concerned about

144
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:26,399
All of the other connected devices it typically don't get updated that often

145
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
Wangjing routers typically don't

146
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,007
What about your webcams

147
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,079
What about your locks what about any Wi-Fi

148
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
Iot device you have

149
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175
This is actually a one-time run like

150
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,759
I'm kind of glad not that many of my devices use Wi-Fi but

151
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,063
Darca market so this is a concern

152
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
So I will just say

153
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
Comcast said

154
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
Probably about a year ago that their average

155
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
Number of Wi-Fi devices in the

156
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
Is 11

157
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
On their Network

158
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
Most of those are

159
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,399
Computers Kindles phones

160
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
Printers

161
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
My printer is never sent me a

162
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Right

163
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,687
But you probably have to do that manually by the way printers are known for their automatic updates

164
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
So I just looked

165
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
My Eero wi-fi system

166
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
Which by the way Euro has a fix

167
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
That is coming out soon

168
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
But is not out

169
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
It will update automatically

170
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,791
I got 31 devices that are currently on my network

171
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
And they're about five or six that were

172
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
We recently on my network

173
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
Including

174
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Somebody's MacBook

175
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
That's my job

176
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,079
My daughters

177
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,735
So here's the rundown of popular things because

178
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Cuz we found it

179
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
Lovely List

180
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
That we will also

181
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Link to it

182
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
Update

183
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
So I talked to linksys Linksys

184
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
Is aware of the issue

185
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,255
Tp-link says they don't know what they're affected

186
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Which

187
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Terrafin

188
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
This why I'm actually very

189
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Concerned with t

190
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
Tp-link stuff even though I have their switches

191
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,495
My house I don't like their Casa stuff

192
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,823
Not because it's bad but because I worry about their ability to

193
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Updating

194
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
They have so many things and they're not great

195
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,063
I should note only because I mentioned it earlier the original Google onhub there's tp-link made one of those two versions

196
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,367
So that's concerning to me

197
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
I feel like

198
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
I regret

199
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
Amazon is in the process of reviewing

200
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Nest

201
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,399
Has told me that it is in the process

202
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,751
Of updating its devices and those updates will roll out automatically

203
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
Knickers where the problem

204
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
Raspberry Pi

205
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
Raspberry Pi

206
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Is

207
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
Fixed Jesse and the stretch

208
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
Squeezy and others

209
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
Barbusa system is good.

210
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
Our Voice Mail system

211
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
He will be

212
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,255
Intel has released firmware updates for

213
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,303
For all of its chipset so a lot of the ones in your

214
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
Computers

215
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
That'll be good

216
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
Windows

217
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Good

218
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Linux

219
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,703
Mac OS

220
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
It's the

221
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Mac OS

222
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
1011.

223
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Beta

224
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
They're still working on that that's correct

225
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
Let's see what other ones do we

226
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,295
I can tell you what I care about cuz I'm looking through the list of devices in my Google Wi-Fi app

227
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
My wink hub

228
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,391
And I would think people have Samsung SmartThings hubs

229
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Don't know yet

230
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Samsung is not doing so

231
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
Skin Samsung

232
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
How about my Roku TV

233
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,447
It's actually built into the TV so I need to get a software update

234
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
Roku via

235
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
The app

236
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
On the TV maker

237
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Worried about Ray

238
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
Kevin arjune

239
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,711
I was just going to say the dirtiest thing in my list

240
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
Your Nevins exactly

241
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
My ecobee thermostat

242
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
My Amazon Kindle

243
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:03,999
Everything pretty much pretty much so that's a list of things that I sent out a bunch of emails I'm still sending out

244
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,583
Maybe next week we'll have a wonderful update for you

245
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
With everything that

246
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
We talked about this

247
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Patched

248
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
I'm not holding my breath but

249
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
That's cracked

250
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,639
And to be fair with me we're not getting to the low-level technical details of this because there are so many details to understand

251
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,223
So definitely you click the link that we're going to have in the show notes

252
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,295
I mean I just went to crack a tax.com which is spelled it all out

253
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,111
You better make a couple cups of coffee to read through all this

254
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
It's a lot

255
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
We did read through it

256
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
If you want to know what

257
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,559
I did not know what announces now I know

258
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
Nonces are

259
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,911
So I spent the whole time

260
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,775
Is a number that is not necessarily

261
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,103
What is meant only to be used once and never repeated

262
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
So the key is the flaw in WP

263
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,199
Pa2 allows that knots

264
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
To be repeated

265
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
So then you can

266
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
Use that session key

267
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
Now you know what an answer

268
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,695
I wonder if it stands for number once knots

269
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
Until the caffeine stick it in can I say

270
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,607
You be like heaven you're exactly right

271
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,471
But now it makes sense but no don't go in Jeopardy without

272
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
Not true

273
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
All right

274
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
So

275
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Let's move on from

276
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Cracked beak

277
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,407
I am not disabled

278
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
My Wi-Fi network

279
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
I am not

280
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
Taking devices offline

281
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,783
Mostly because they don't have cameras facing

282
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
Inside if I did

283
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Take those offline

284
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,415
So can we talk about another Downer story

285
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
How I spent my Monday

286
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
I spent mine researching crack Kevin

287
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:46,143
Driving 230 miles round-trip unexpectedly to this is just background for the next news item so

288
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
Spare me

289
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,263
One minute here to tell little personal story on Sunday night when my son returned

290
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
From home to college

291
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
She goes to Bloomsburg University

292
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,407
Which is about 110 miles away from where we live

293
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,759
He got there at 10 at night on Sunday night and I don't have my apartment key

294
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
It was at his girlfriend's near my house

295
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,367
What is good to build a Do

296
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,183
The key and drives it all the way up there on Monday

297
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,975
Drives all the way back home

298
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,047
And I said guess what you're getting an early Christmas gift

299
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,887
My friend you were getting a Bluetooth tracker for your apartment keys

300
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,239
And that leads us to our news item related to this that Samsung

301
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:26,079
Actually just announced and will be showing off this week or deliver next week

302
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
A GPS tracker

303
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,223
That uses nb-iot cat M so basically it's

304
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
On the IRT

305
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,087
And Cat and that is correct I had a slash in the show notes

306
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
My bad I did not say

307
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
You are correct

308
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,719
They're going to showing that off this weekend

309
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Samsung developer

310
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:50,143
Protect actually going on today they say it's small It's relatively small and smaller track

311
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
Widen one point

312
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,703
2 centimeters thick

313
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,543
Is waterproof and dustproof you have to recharge it

314
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
The battery inside last for

315
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
7 Days on a single charge

316
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,943
You can certainly attach it to anything you like just like

317
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
Traditional

318
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
Tracking device

319
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,599
Martha GPS as I said wifi-based positioning and cellular ID so

320
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:15,999
It's got a lot of ways to be found I don't know what it's going to cost or anything like that but I'm kind of interested in this especially because

321
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
It can be use pretty much anywhere there's a

322
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Narrowband Network

323
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,423
And that's in more and more places especially in Europe although the cat enemas going to help

324
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,007
Other than T-Mobile most of the carriers

325
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
More focused

326
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Uncat am

327
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
As opposed to NBA

328
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Although

329
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
I'm going to say I think

330
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Your AT&T to Verizon

331
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,039
AT&T is doing cat am I know that

332
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,391
Okay so let's talk about why you chose

333
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,719
I thank you because

334
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:51,071
I may have missed it in my research but I know that you've looked at these I'm sure some of our listeners have looking

335
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
The tiles the

336
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,935
Trackers there's various ones out there

337
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
I was looking for a very specific function

338
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:03,871
And I only found one device that could do it and that function is a walk away or separation

339
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
An alert and it seems to me again

340
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
My research

341
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
Maybe baby is lacking

342
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
Only the older

343
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
Tracker

344
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Bravo

345
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
Nothing new trackr pixel

346
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,647
Can do separation alerts meaning

347
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,951
If my son has one attached to his keys

348
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,743
Any walks out of Bluetooth range

349
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,607
From those keys when you left them behind 30 feet away or whatever it is is phone will get an alert at 9

350
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,167
I dummy you left your keys in

351
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
So I ended up

352
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,007
He's getting today from Amazon he's getting a tree

353
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Bravo

354
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,359
I couldn't find any other trackers that do that and I don't understand why that is

355
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
And you had some thoughts

356
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
Before the show witch

357
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,967
Are valid thoughts would you want to share them cuz I'm not

358
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,759
Sure so 1 is

359
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
There's also a battery

360
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
They're not always

361
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
2 is

362
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,695
Not everybody wants like

363
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
I walk out of Bluetooth

364
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
Stranger in my house all the time

365
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Nikes for exam

366
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
And I would hate for it to beep every time

367
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
Absolutely not

368
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
Sure and I would have the same problem

369
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
Yeah I would have the same problem in my home if I used

370
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
I totally get that

371
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,151
Okay so what so what

372
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
I countered

373
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:16,319
I see your I don't want this feature within I'll raise you that a that feature should be optional it is

374
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
You have to enable it

375
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
In the tracker app

376
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,183
In this particular instance number one or number two

377
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
Why aren't these things smarter

378
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,023
And I mean that because we already have

379
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,423
Sensors that they can leverage it on her phone they work with a phone with a companion to your phone so why not have a

380
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
GPS geofence

381
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
That says hey

382
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
Disable this feature when I'm at home

383
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
And I've walked away without my

384
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
Mikey's cuz granted if I walk out of the house without me

385
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
My car keys

386
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,199
I kicked my car obviously I know I have left

387
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
My keys at the house

388
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
I don't need to know that when I'm at home

389
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
When I'm out and about the GPS from the

390
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Hey let's start

391
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
Doing separation

392
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
Because now you're out and about

393
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
I just

394
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,303
Why we not leveraging that wire at maker

395
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,095
There's not do not the app makers book

396
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
Device makers with their apps not doing that

397
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,543
Well and that's a good question because we've talked actually you talked about this with your airpods so we'll bring the same cuz this is kind of a

398
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
Bluetooth means

399
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
I don't know what to do

400
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
The Bluetooth aspect that needs

401
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
To be smarter

402
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,783
Or if it's at makers need to adapt their apps to Bluetooth being on

403
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Thinx

404
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,391
And talking to the phone more often and what that will do for

405
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
Core power consumption

406
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,207
Your airpod

407
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
Sample is actually really

408
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
It's the other side of the same

409
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,887
Well I think you're letting to my Apple watch with LTE

410
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,751
Because one of the points that I had made again continuing on the app makers need to

411
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
Add more smart

412
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,591
A nest cam use just your phone at the home away feature

413
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:47,199
Right so you can set it up to not record when you're at home and it uses the GPS new phone to say

414
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,991
Your home check the cameras don't need it

415
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,575
The issue I have with nest and probably with other apps is

416
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
When I leave the phone at home and go for

417
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
Run

418
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,927
I have my Apple watch LTE

419
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:03,327
Add and find my friends my wife can see where I am find my friends are smart enough to know a his phone is at home he's out and about

420
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
With the watch

421
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
He was where he is on the roads right now

422
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
But Nest does not know

423
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
Has any other device that uses my

424
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
IPhone as

425
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
The primary

426
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Point of presence

427
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
So

428
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,127
Third party app makers and device makers are going to have to start thinking as you just said

429
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:22,527
For more Bluetooth devices more devices that let you still be connected away from the phone that's something that I would love to see

430
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
Happen very soon

431
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,111
OC and I was talking about your airpod

432
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,927
Challenges of if you're listening to TV

433
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,487
Your TV on them and then you look off in Iraq

434
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Your phone is

435
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:38,911
And that is a guy that's a little aggressive it automatically switches me to the phone if it sent as a video I might want to listen to

436
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
On the browser on the phone

437
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
Disconnect from the TV

438
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
What I didn't want to be

439
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,615
Heaven is that because we thought

440
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
Mini Bluetooth devices acting is

441
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
But we also have many different

442
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
Computer sources

443
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,599
Soda used to be only our phone right that these devices talk to

444
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,159
But now it could be your watch or

445
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Your

446
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Amazon Echo

447
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,743
Or your television

448
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:08,607
Suddenly both the Computing device in the apps running on them to be smarter about what

449
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
Computer to use

450
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
But also

451
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,007
The Bluetooth devices need to be smarter about when to switch to these diff

452
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
Different devices it's

453
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Kind of a night

454
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,103
I would think it's hard

455
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Contacts

456
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Of

457
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
Device usage is hard

458
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:27,551
When you're switching between multiple connected devices so I'm not trying to rag on these companies

459
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,599
Too much because I get the challenge I do

460
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,951
I hope they recognize the challenge and they start to do something about it is really my point

461
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Yes

462
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
All right

463
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
Let's talk about

464
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
Some devices

465
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
Sonos

466
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
You

467
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
Did a review

468
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,775
I did I did I so I spent a week with the new Sonos one and wrote up a review

469
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:52,383
Over at Stacey on iot. Calm so you can read the whole thing if you'd like but the

470
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
Too long didn't read version is

471
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,711
I haven't never use a sauna

472
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
And having

473
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,831
Purchase for Echo devices and one Google home device

474
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,647
I'm pretty much sold on replacing some Echoes with

475
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,951
Bassano's once I'm going to send the review unit back

476
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
I'm going to buy

477
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,511
Possibly one or two

478
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,583
Sonos one devices to replace them because

479
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,631
The sound quality is outstanding

480
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,935
Edit does work really well as a

481
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,471
Digital assistant

482
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
With a few limitation

483
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
Remember this is not an a

484
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:26,431
Echo device is a Sonos device using Alexa voice Services which is done through this Sonos

485
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,991
Alexa skill and by limitations I mean

486
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,551
You can't use the drop-in feature

487
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,903
For example on a Sonos you can do voice calls on it

488
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
Echo with matter baby

489
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,231
Cannot do it on the Sonos at least not yet

490
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,791
And I questioned you ever will be able to I think Amazon

491
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:46,399
Hold on to those and have some product differentiation as they allow voice services to expand.

492
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Other devices

493
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
I couldn't group Bassano's with

494
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
Echo is for speakers

495
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:54,079
Mix and match groups here she come out and we'll have to go all in if you want

496
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Multi-room audio

497
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,223
So it works really well as a personal digital assistant with a few limitations I should say

498
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,807
And it is 199 and the cool feature that is coming

499
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
Don't know

500
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
You obviously didn't ask

501
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
It's not out there yet

502
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Is

503
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
It will have Google Assistant

504
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Also

505
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
In addition to madam

506
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
628

507
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,071
That's correct and that's a big

508
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:19,935
Piece of my decision making process because Sonos is smartly being

509
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,007
Assistant agnostic are there also adding air place

510
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,055
Support next year as well which

511
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
I presume will allow you to

512
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,383
Voice control Apple music and other things

513
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,663
So that

514
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Choice of assistant

515
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,503
Is really appealing to me personally

516
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
I switch between

517
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:40,671
I don't want to have to be locked in a sense to an assistant ecosystem as it were

518
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
All right

519
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
Now let's see

520
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
Some fun Halloween

521
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
Here we go

522
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:52,191
Smart home devices have reached 15% of households that's up from 10%

523
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Last eight

524
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
Last April being able to

525
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
So this is from the MPD

526
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
So

527
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,103
Yay

528
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
Progress

529
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
Honeywell Honeywell last week

530
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
Best investor that way

531
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,015
Was saying hey get rid of your Aerospace

532
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,063
Division in Honeywell turned around and said no

533
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
Instead we're going to get rid of her

534
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
Car parts

535
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,695
Diagnostics of and our home security business

536
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
Which includes

537
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
The Smart Home

538
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Home stuff

539
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
So this is

540
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:22,143
Dollars worth of Revenue on the home security business that's going to include

541
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
You know the lyrics

542
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:28,543
Home cameras the formal home security Honeywell does have a home security business much like

543
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,079
80 +

544
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
They also

545
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
This week

546
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,991
Actually announced that they are going to go on Indiegogo to sell a all-in-one sink

547
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,319
Security device that has a camera and some sensors kind of like the

548
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Piper are the

549
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
Canary

550
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Dictionary

551
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,903
Which is kind of struggling and

552
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
So

553
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
Before that that should

554
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
To be out in

555
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
On Indiegogo

556
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:54,911
Also wanted to talk about ADT Pulse briefly because a couple weeks ago we did a thing on security and ADT

557
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,799
Hey pulse is still around Stacy we actually have over 2 million installs and in

558
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
April we integrated with

559
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Amazon

560
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
Echo

561
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919
So for all of you who are wondering ATT

562
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
The pulse is the

563
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
ATT home automation

564
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
It still exist

565
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
And now they also have their

566
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
SmartThings

567
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
A meeting with ADT.

568
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
How those two things

569
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
Things are actually

570
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:24,096
So it's not often we talk about Apple and Industrial iot but just today

571
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:28,448
The company announced via press release that they are ruining with General Electric

572
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,008
GE to offer a

573
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Predix

574
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
SDK 4

575
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:37,152
IOS apps that will be downloadable next week

576
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:43,552
Basically it will help developers build apps for iPhones and iPads using predicts data collection analysis and

577
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,600
And I was wondering why they're doing this

578
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
I kind of think

579
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,440
Minato wants to certainly make industrial and

580
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
Enterprise apps

581
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,864
For the mobile devices I get that but I also think that GE decided hey if we standardize on iOS devices

582
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
And Max

583
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:04,032
You know maybe we can get a little bit of a break here so let's do a little deal and as a result GE is going to do just that

584
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,824
Guys on iPhones iPads at Max

585
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
330

586
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,128
Thousand

587
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:14,528
Employees so that's a big device win for Apple overtime and then all those users will get

588
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:19,648
To use apps with geez products on their iOS devices

589
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,024
So that was their first big partnership I believe

590
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
Enterprise

591
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
All right

592
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,912
Also this week we should probably have done this earlier on in the show but that's okay

593
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
Can't we got some fun test

594
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,032
So Amazon Echo added voice recognition

595
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
To its devices

596
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,616
Who You Are

597
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Or

598
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
Dashie

599
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
Where does

600
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,480
Google home

601
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
A while back

602
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,088
Couple months ago they released it so six different users

603
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,392
It would recognize us 264

604
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,464
User voice profiles

605
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
Hey, Mama

606
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
My mom

607
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,328
A my husband when he says, I'm

608
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
It's going to call his mom

609
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,192
So we tested this at my house in

610
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
This is what we

611
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
1

612
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,800
It is not consistent so here we go

613
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,616
Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't

614
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,408
Yay live TV

615
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
Oar radio

616
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
Alexa

617
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Who am I

618
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
I'm not sure who

619
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,416
Not sure who's speaking but your instincts is account I'm actually I tested

620
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,464
And I had the same problem although I was not in Europe

621
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
I was in mine

622
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
Like

623
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,608
There's a lot of Pies going out on this

624
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
What's happening

625
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
We tested this

626
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,800
It's a little iffy and it worked for my husband sometimes

627
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,616
And it didn't work for him when he fakely

628
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
Mages voice deeper

629
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,968
It doesn't work for me it only works for me

630
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
So I'm not sure what's going

631
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,808
What you do is you go into

632
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,088
To your settings

633
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
What's on your bottom

634
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,672
And you go into

635
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Voice

636
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
And you're going to

637
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,488
Basically say

638
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,768
I'm me

639
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
Or maybe you're someone else if you're not you

640
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,608
And you're in someone else's account

641
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
The matinee

642
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,448
And then you just say 10 phrases and

643
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,984
Principally that

644
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,640
The challenge I had was with my daughter who doesn't actually have a handset

645
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,432
That right now because I'm using her phone

646
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,712
For my own

647
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992
While I wait for my pixel

648
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,296
And so to get her

649
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
On the thing

650
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
I would have to

651
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,136
Find a third device in my

652
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,672
A household that she could use

653
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,952
Golang

654
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,512
And she would also need an Amazon Echo

655
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
So and she doesn't have

656
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Because she's 11

657
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
What was a little wacky for

658
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
And I also think

659
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
Kids

660
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
Their voices

661
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Change

662
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,664
So if you're going to use this in a family setting keep that in mind because as the kids get older they may need to retrain the voice right

663
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,688
Definition for their

664
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Profile

665
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
Final

666
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
Super fun you guys

667
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
So if

668
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,928
Was inspired

669
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,208
Possibly buy

670
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
They say it was

671
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
So it was inspired

672
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,072
Buy a video idea

673
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,864
Madame turn on Christmas

674
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
And they

675
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
Have done it

676
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,192
Turn on Halloween

677
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
And so

678
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
We actually abused

679
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
If

680
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
To create Apple

681
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
4

682
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,336
Halloween stuff

683
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,616
And now

684
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,200
If this done this formally so we're going to like to a blog post that has all of the

685
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
But

686
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,504
Some of them include like

687
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,808
Changing your Hue Lights to Orange

688
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
On Halloween

689
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,416
You can do it so it pulses your lights

690
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,512
When your skybell doorbell detects motion so as those trick-or-treaters come up

691
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
Strobe effect

692
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,376
Scare the kids that's good

693
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
Don't

694
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,520
You can also set up a motion

695
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
And

696
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,592
Haven't

697
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
You know that someone's

698
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
I'm coming up to your door

699
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,712
We've been the past actually used it to set up a motion sensor

700
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,736
And then had

701
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Blow dryer

702
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
Plugged in

703
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
On a ghost

704
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,624
We made and so it would turn on the blow dryer in the

705
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,584
I can picture that I can see it in my head

706
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,144
There's a bunch of

707
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
Seas including

708
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:18,496
Automate some scare so if you press a button

709
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
Here.

710
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
Start cleaning

711
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,336
Which I guess if you stuck something

712
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Great

713
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,968
Those are basically kind of

714
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
Some fun

715
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
Set up

716
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,856
It set up a motion sensor and have it trigger your tongue

717
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,208
Lots of fun

718
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,744
And check these recipes out

719
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,304
Adapt them for your products and

720
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,352
Level of scariness you want to

721
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,888
Create and

722
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912
Happy happy

723
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,592
No she's not

724
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
Sorry

725
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
Why should say this was in

726
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
In place of

727
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Vioc hot

728
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,832
Cuz we didn't want to have so many

729
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:11,232
Don't forget feel free to give us a call

730
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Iot hotline

731
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
And that number is

732
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
512

733
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
6 to 3

734
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
7 4

735
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
To 4

736
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
Next week will be back

737
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
Answering your

738
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
So

739
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
I think that instead

740
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,568
News portion of the show Anne

741
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,640
Stay tuned for a message from our sponsor Qualcomm

742
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,664
And

743
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,224
An awesome interview with John Murray

744
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,016
About environmental sensing

745
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,064
And what it takes to actually key

746
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
Flood sensor

747
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,624
And what it actually takes

748
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:43,744
Keep flood sensors online during an actual play it's harder than you think

749
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,584
Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message

750
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,168
From our sponsor this week sponsor is Qualcomm

751
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,960
And I have Anthony Murray

752
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,264
Who is SVP and GM

753
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
A voice in music

754
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
At Qualcomm technology

755
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:04,224
Alright so it seems like there's a lot going on around voice interfaces speakers headphones

756
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,528
What are the big underlying trend

757
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:11,648
Yeah it's amazing, no industry and in all the years of being in the spice

758
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
I haven't seen this many major

759
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
Changes oil

760
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
Come together at one time

761
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
Uses release

762
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
Streaming the Odeon

763
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,864
The contents rather than downloading it as they use

764
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,912
Doing this is really driving the

765
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,680
Requirements

766
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
Very robust

767
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,984
Wireless communication

768
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,824
Then we see some of the handset manufacturers not removing the

769
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,384
Traditional three-and-a-half millimeter audio jack

770
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
And that's really feeling the mark

771
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,480
Looking for wireless speakers and head

772
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,296
And then the number of the Odyssey

773
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320
Assistant devices

774
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
Ominously

775
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
Plexus is damaged

776
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,928
Is an ex-felon Google home in this is really

777
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,000
Educating consumers and the Mons

778
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:52,096
Full voice interaction and voice control of their products within the Hein

779
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,376
We'll see this

780
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
Trend we're really

781
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
People of China

782
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,728
Enterprise a new category which has been

783
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:03,360
Old Spice and this is taking a headset which Disney did it say music

784
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
Voice

785
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
A step further in adding

786
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
Functions

787
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
Hearing assist

788
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
Potential even biometric monitor

789
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Activities except

790
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,856
That is a lot of computing

791
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
Empower patent

792
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,952
This seems like a really hard

793
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,976
Thing to build

794
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,280
How is Qualcomm supporting these

795
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,864
This category represent some big technical challenges

796
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,168
You've got a separate left and right earbuds

797
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,448
What is a lot of interact

798
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,264
Between the two and how do you do that and then

799
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
Pics of RF Mana

800
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
Guilin China

801
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,640
Cancel the ambient noise cancellation in your environment

802
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,200
Wilson need to make sure that there's absolutely

803
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,248
Audio quality

804
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
Holcomb's aptx

805
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
HD Kodak

806
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:50,208
And then the device has to be always listening to use us that you can access your favorite child service

807
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,768
So this functionality has so many Act

808
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,072
Components that need to run all day

809
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,120
And miniature to the point that occur

810
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,704
Powers absolutely of Paramount

811
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,800
Houghton Holcomb does this really brings it all together and

812
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
Xiaomi package

813
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,200
And efficient enough to be able to run all day Alpena

814
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,480
Customers realize the vision

815
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,760
I'll be here about

816
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
Goldie

817
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,160
Awesome so we're can listeners learn more and get started using qualcomm's Technologies for hearable

818
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,976
Let him go to Qualcomm. Calm and search

819
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,256
Search for voice and music

820
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,840
Then I'll find lots of information on our platform offerings

821
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,656
As well as some consumer research that we've done

822
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,240
And as well as various products that leverage our kokum technology

823
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:38,336
That's qualcomm.com and search for voice and music

824
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:51,392
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

825
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,928
And today's guest is

826
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,976
Mary who is the chief

827
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,512
Administrative officer

828
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
Hi John how are you doing today

829
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,424
I'm great Stacy thanks I'm glad to be with you

830
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,240
Man I am super excited because

831
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
You guys

832
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,128
So we should first start off by letting everybody know what the LCRA is

833
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
So I'll let you do.

834
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:17,248
Sure sue the LCRA was started 80 years ago

835
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
By the Texas legislature

836
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,112
And it stands for the lower Colorado River Authority which just

837
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:26,208
These are National and international listeners is based in Austin Texas

838
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,768
So there's actually another Colorado River that's into

839
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,584
Texas was created in 1935 in the middle of the

840
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,912
The Great Depression with a very important public mission

841
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
Provide

842
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,240
Water to Central Texas

843
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,824
Do flood control and tell people from a watershed

844
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
Supplying water safety standpoint but it was done at a time

845
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
When

846
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,944
The state didn't have any money

847
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,784
So the way they created on Sirius has a selfie

848
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,184
Supporting government entity so they gave us the ability to sell this newfangled thing called electricity on which turned out pretty

849
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,024
Also we also are a wholesale electricity provider

850
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,304
And the second largest

851
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,864
Electric transmission provider in the state of Texas

852
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
Awesome so

853
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:11,008
The reason I actually asked you on the show is because I was looking during Hurricane

854
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,800
Because I was checking

855
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Is this River going to Crest

856
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,640
So I thought

857
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,944
Hey let's get John on the show.

858
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
Talk about

859
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,040
Things are happening

860
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
Definitely crazy

861
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
How should we think about

862
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
Offering

863
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,720
Real time

864
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
Citizens

865
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,328
You guys have been doing this for years so let's talk about

866
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
How you guys monitor

867
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
Two Rivers

868
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:43,776
Started his mission like I said from 80 years ago has started with

869
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:48,128
Troll Austin is a beautiful city but it's a great representative City in the sand

870
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,944
In what meteorologists call flash flood alley

871
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,320
Play so there are a lot of rivers that converge into Austin and then the number of cities along

872
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:00,416
The river all the way out to the coast that had before this very persistent problem

873
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,720
Ysleta gun to flood control

874
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,816
Keeping people safe from floods with something that else Siri is always been in the business

875
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,840
The end

876
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,656
Results I think the way we've tried

877
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,728
To live out that mission has changed as technology

878
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:19,104
It literally started with people who live along the river with log books

879
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,920
Who would come in a hurry down to LCRA and

880
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:25,760
Tell us their data and then it turned into people who would call LCRA on

881
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,552
Newfangled Stone Mountain's Intelius

882
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:32,416
What was going on with the river and we've progressed and how we do that overtime to try to keep pace

883
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,976
With you using the technology that's out there

884
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:41,376
Can meet at Mission to understand where the water is now and where we think it's going to be and so LCRA has

885
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,424
Is a system now that's called hydromat

886
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
That was designed

887
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,592
2 years ago and it is a that's the kind of digital version of what we used to do in that very analog

888
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:54,432
Manual way so we have a network is 270

889
00:33:54,688 --> 00:34:00,832
What sensors that are placed in strategic locations along more than eight hundred miles of the river we collect data from

890
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,368
Those that data gets

891
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
Processed

892
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
And

893
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:08,512
Provided back out to the public First Responders and the media

894
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
Via an internet website

895
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,352
Hydromet. Lcra.org

896
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,632
And that provides

897
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,704
What are the county judges in our area called at the great truther

898
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,032
It's being able to provide a common data set

899
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
Reading this

900
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,384
In a real-time digital format that everybody can use across

901
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
Cities counties

902
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,712
National Weather Service

903
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,480
You name it

904
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,552
That's kind of where l-series not right now is to

905
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,344
Maintain and provide that data

906
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,392
Back under this kind of

907
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,464
Platform looks like ourselves will use for flood

908
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,792
Okay so what's the internet Network for

909
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,328
Because

910
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,632
How much do these cost

911
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,448
How real time is the real time

912
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,984
LCRA

913
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Estimate

914
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,800
Step by this point we've spent

915
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,128
Seek on the order of about 20 million dollars building

916
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,688
System so it's been a pretty significant in bus

917
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,760
A lot of the investment is actually in

918
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,528
Maintenance

919
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,808
Sending data collection

920
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
So we built

921
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,136
A 900 megahertz

922
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Radio Network

923
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,464
Work that is designed to get they deduct from Oliver

924
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,256
Including transmission

925
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,048
Electric generation and water

926
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:18,912
But that's one of the hardest points as you need a way to get you know over 800 miles

927
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,240
Class of river you need a way to get the data back from the sensor

928
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:28,896
So that's where a lot of that cost is gone isn't it building radio towers in the infrastructure to connect to the sensors

929
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,712
With l-series Homebase the sensors themselves

930
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,040
Are great their top-of-the-line that's really the

931
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:39,904
Jewel of the Nile is what National Weather Service USGS others use

932
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:45,024
The cheapest and best flood sensors you can use these days cost between 25

933
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,584
50000 CM * $75,000

934
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,888
Santa have a lot of

935
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:53,216
Yeah that's pretty expensive they tend to have a lot of maintenance

936
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,752
So typically a technician

937
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
Lisa glancy the Mary

938
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
12 weeks

939
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:01,408
And when you spread them out over 800 miles that that's a pretty labor-intensive crop

940
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
Possession Sarah

941
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,504
It's a great system but I think it's a system that we're trying to

942
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,368
Find ways to drive that cost down so that we could scale it to provide

943
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
In a better data from a larger

944
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
Region

945
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:15,488
Why didn't you guys choose a cellular network

946
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,536
4

947
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,584
Network or is it because

948
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,632
Spread across power generation

949
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,496
We're doing a good chunk of research now on

950
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:31,616
Cellular as a possible alternatives to at or either as an alternative or to augment

951
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,896
The radio coverage

952
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:39,296
It was timing though so at the time that the system was built to the cellular provider is didn't have enough coverage

953
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:45,696
And they didn't have enough data rates to be able to get this type of information back not that radio is it pretty

954
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,512
Piccadilly high-bandwidth mechanism but we really just

955
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,840
Fundamentally doesn't have the coverage we needed to be able to get

956
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,912
The data any other way now the cellular Networks

957
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:58,496
Are advancing so much and have increased their coverage so much

958
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,848
And with these new standards around what they called LTE - M

959
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:06,432
There's more cellular carriers that are trying to make their Networks

960
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,248
Play well with devices as opposed to West voice

961
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:16,160
My phone so I think it's promising that there is some potential that cellular could end up to be a good now

962
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,488
I work for us but at the time we just really couldn't get the coverage

963
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:25,888
And the bad wreck that we needed we also need for this type of Aspen application do we need Public Safety level reliability soap

964
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,448
If we operate our radios on that same network

965
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,104
A lot of police departments a lot of we have actually 10,000 devices connected to radio not working only 18 of them

966
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
RLC replay song

967
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,712
The rest are either devices sensors or

968
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,760
First Responders in communities

969
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,064
So you need kind of

970
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,624
Lots of coverage good data rates

971
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,976
Very very high Public Safety level reliability

972
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,024
Cellular really wasn't there

973
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
When we built it but I think

974
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
It may be there now

975
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:59,936
So we're really looking pretty intensely to see whether that's something we can transition

976
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,496
Alright so let's go back to the mission

977
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,032
Because I sit there

978
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
Look at this stuff

979
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,408
Is it flooding

980
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
I'm sorry

981
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,224
It's really sad State of Affairs for me

982
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,320
How quickly is this date coming in

983
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:20,672
The website is to talk about what happened

984
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
You're a freak rainstorm

985
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
During a flood

986
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,792
What happens in your operations

987
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,096
The typical refresh rate

988
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,888
For the sensors that we have an hour about

989
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:35,008
Every 15 minutes for a lot of folks I think we would consider that to be fairly close to real time

990
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
That being said

991
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,944
We are doing a pretty extensive research project now to see if we can increase that or have the ability to

992
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,296
First to the sampling rate to be much faster during kind of peak conditions

993
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,880
So you know can we take readings every minute or multiple times a minute

994
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:54,976
But it's still you know that's still see really close to real-time but in its last flood

995
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:55,744
Situation

996
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,048
Specialist First Responders we really want to be able

997
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,840
Multi gather data at a higher

998
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
Playwright

999
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:07,008
The travel time it takes to get the data process from the sensors out onto the website is actually

1000
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,080
Are they close to real time and we like to tell folks that

1001
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:16,480
One of the nice principles about these types of systems is that the peak speed at The Inferno

1002
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
Formation can travel under Network

1003
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,856
Is fairly close to the speed of light which is a lot faster than water moves

1004
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:25,952
So we should be able to get the information before the water gets there

1005
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:32,352
In the real physical world so the processing side of its pretty near-instantaneous the sampling rate about every 15 minutes

1006
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,400
Approved

1007
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,192
Okay and so

1008
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,752
If there's a hurricane or a massive

1009
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:45,152
What do guys like

1010
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,224
Yeah so that's another reason

1011
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
That the radio network comes in

1012
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,296
In a flood event

1013
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:55,904
It typically you'll see a lot more activity around that hydroment

1014
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:01,024
So the first thing we'll do in anticipation of a flooded start a fire Emergency Operations

1015
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,888
We have a river operations center that stopped 24/7 all the time

1016
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:10,240
But in an emergency will kind of kick that up to a higher response level

1017
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,544
So additional groups will come in

1018
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,944
Are Public Safety team which is one of the groups in my organization comes in and coordinates and run the unified incident command

1019
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
Structure

1020
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:23,040
And then that can be stuffed up to 24 hours a day as well

1021
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,600
Also the whole company kind of shift

1022
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,624
So wavy

1023
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
From what it's

1024
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,208
Normally doing and kind of moves them

1025
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:35,072
Just over to this Emergency Operations fitting so what happens in the field then

1026
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,096
Is it becomes

1027
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,912
Absolutely essential to make sure those kids are up at

1028
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:43,264
So will have filled Cruz that'll be dispatched all over if there's any

1029
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,664
Songs with either radio conductivity the gauges themselves and you can't imagine you in a flood that gauges sometimes need

1030
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
Need to be moved

1031
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:56,832
Is it possible for them to be impacted by debris or washed away Telecom Towers can lose power which means

1032
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,856
We have to go get

1033
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,160
Fuel out to them to keep them up and running

1034
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,696
So we'll have us a

1035
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,464
Siri

1036
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,560
High degree of operational focus on maintaining that Network

1037
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,352
Keeping it running during the

1038
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,912
Slides and all of our Emergency Operations

1039
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
Calls

1040
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,728
During a flood start with Hydro

1041
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:20,128
So the first thing we do is look at the weather forecast and Hydromet to see where the water is going and it's really the backbone

1042
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,664
As everything else that happen

1043
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,992
It's beyond that to make decisions about opening and closing dams

1044
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:29,600
Send dispatching First Responders everything is based off of that data that comes

1045
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,648
Turn up system so one of the highest

1046
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,672
Priorities

1047
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:37,280
System running it is not uncommon that we have multiple Crews headed out

1048
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,840
Go either protector gauge or move it or

1049
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,888
In augmented to make sure that that system

1050
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,912
Stays up and running

1051
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
Emergency

1052
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,472
So what you have this day

1053
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
What then

1054
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,824
You have obviously update the website you got the public safety camp

1055
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,592
How does that

1056
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,616
Going to play

1057
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,199
His role is really in a

1058
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,759
As a data provider so generally that's the

1059
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,039
Part of the equation

1060
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:03,647
Network doing ourselves but one of the things were spending a lot of time working on is

1061
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Figuring out

1062
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,207
How local Jurassic

1063
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,999
Cities and counties in

1064
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:13,631
Particular can do more things with the data and so we've got some real active research in a program

1065
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,423
Calling smart alert switches

1066
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,447
How do you take

1067
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,983
Real-time sensor data

1068
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,799
And apply rules and

1069
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
Models to it

1070
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:26,431
So that in a real evacuation a real emergency

1071
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,735
Those First Responders are

1072
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:33,087
Empowered with much more micro targeted capabilities for alerting

1073
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,927
What are the challenges that First Responders have now without that

1074
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,743
Is many times evacuating a city for ants

1075
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:44,607
Is an all-or-nothing proposition I live in the city of Cedar Park if you're there emergency manager there

1076
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:49,215
You either evacuate 70000 people or you don't it's kind of All or Nothing

1077
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:54,847
What would you like to do is be able to use these types of sensors to provide a platform

1078
00:42:55,103 --> 00:43:01,247
That those types of First Responders can use to say you know what what if I could micro-target this information figure out exactly which house

1079
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:07,135
Exactly which neighborhoods are in Tanger and get targeted messages out to them and not alarm the entire rest

1080
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:10,207
Maybe maybe 65

1081
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,767
Housing people in Cedar Park are fine

1082
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:19,167
And it's just 5,000 that need to get an immediate message we want to try to improve the granularity and

1083
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,959
Does quality of those alerts

1084
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,543
So that First Responders who use our data have a better

1085
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,335
Experience and better outcomes

1086
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,895
Meeting people out of the way or out of Harm's Way

1087
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,991
LCRA would never see ourselves as the ones to actually generate the other

1088
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:39,391
Because we're kind of the backend service provider but we're trying to do is to make it easier for those who actually have that Authority on the

1089
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
Underground

1090
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:44,511
To be able to have a signer green control has hounded activation happens

1091
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,327
How their response to a s*** happen

1092
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,471
Okay and actually tied to that would be better information not just from maybe hydromat data

1093
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,055
But also date actual flooding

1094
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,847
And things that I don't even know if we

1095
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,127
Calculator

1096
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,967
A lot of people were told to evacuate

1097
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,015
Probably

1098
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,319
I can't evacuate cuz I don't know where to

1099
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,135
Those city managers

1100
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,927
And First Responders are actually going to need

1101
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,463
Not just your day. But

1102
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
Other data

1103
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:19,583
So that's also right and we would like to try to help them

1104
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,143
Find a way to combine our data

1105
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,935
With other data they have

1106
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:29,311
Or either didn't know they can acquire as a city more effectively and I'll give you a great example that

1107
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,871
One of the great science fiction authors William Gibson

1108
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,967
Said something to the effect of the future is already here it's just not evenly distributed

1109
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,271
So I'm trying to drive to work this morning

1110
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,295
Coming from a wreck

1111
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:45,439
Using Google GPS with amazing data knows to route me around the Austin City Limits music

1112
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,999
I didn't know it started Friday I thought it started

1113
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:54,399
Saturday but I didn't need to worry about it because now that's some revelers and some folks are in the way no worries Google can rob me right around

1114
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,191
We haven't caught up to that

1115
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
Safety

1116
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,519
So there are a lot of dangers

1117
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:03,103
That a city would love to Route their folks around

1118
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:09,503
But the data is not managed and combined with the same ease that Apple and Google can do

1119
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,783
Do with traffic data

1120
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:15,135
That's a huge gap and I think we'd love to try to bring

1121
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
The sophistication that's already there

1122
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,767
In other places with these GPS companies with OnStar

1123
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:25,887
Others and somehow give First Responders a way to combine that with a type of data that got from folks

1124
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,727
To be able to have any more effective

1125
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495
Smarter

1126
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,775
Basement outside

1127
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,103
Evacuation because there's so many of those things like you say that just don't

1128
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,919
Makes sense in one of the challenges that First Responders have

1129
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,711
Cuz we also don't realize quite how difficult

1130
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:46,111
Their job is most of the time they have to develop I mean it's standard best practice if they develop all their evacuation plan

1131
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,671
Years in advance of an actual situation

1132
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:55,071
How do you ever get that right cuz every situation is different in every situation requires these kind of real-time chain

1133
00:45:55,327 --> 00:46:00,703
Angels and many times those things that looks too silly to us in retrospect comes from the fact that they had to build their plans

1134
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,495
So far ahead of the axles

1135
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,799
Situation that they can't really solve

1136
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,335
Problem with great level

1137
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
Awesome

1138
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
And scary

1139
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,967
All right now I'd like in theaters

1140
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,551
So we'll look for an API to get your data in through Google

1141
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,087
Maybe I'll keep talking to Google

1142
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:17,855
During life

1143
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,135
Crises

1144
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,415
So what did I do

1145
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,719
Would you like that you don't have

1146
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,999
I think there's

1147
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,047
Two main things that I

1148
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:26,815
Want

1149
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,583
If we don't have a

1150
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:32,703
I think one is just more of the type of day that we have and the cost

1151
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,983
Actor comes into

1152
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:40,383
Play there right so keyed up budgets are limited Sea-Doo dust you can write and we can put as many gauges out there as we can visit

1153
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
A lot of smaller communities is

1154
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,503
To extend coverage to that the problem is

1155
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,783
The cost is

1156
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,551
Primitive

1157
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:54,207
So you want to put five more gauges in now the capital Investments 250,000 500,000

1158
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:58,559
Dollars you got to train up new workers to go maintain them that gets expensive very fast

1159
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,607
So we're really trying hard to find

1160
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:04,191
Cheaper and better ways to just drive the cost of those

1161
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:10,591
The data collection down it would be great to just have more data points of the same type

1162
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,383
Hypo spino water level water flosser

1163
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,151
Be kind of info

1164
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,711
But I think you know the other part of your question about

1165
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,015
What data do you want but you don't

1166
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:21,087
Is other types of data other categories of

1167
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,207
Water levels and water velocity and then we have weather data

1168
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:32,095
And that's pretty much it weather radar that's that's typically all week have would like to expand to have

1169
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:38,495
Other types of sensors on the network so you know water quality sensors to measuring I mean in this is just kind of blue

1170
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:42,079
This guy type Vision but if we could measure Environmental Quality

1171
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
Of the water

1172
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:43,871
You know are there any

1173
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,895
Clinton said that things

1174
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,711
Like that happen in soil moisture is

1175
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,527
I need a really really useful for flood modeling

1176
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,551
Very difficult

1177
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,319
Information

1178
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,879
Other types of

1179
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:58,463
Ambien information data sets would be really helpful

1180
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,511
The final question

1181
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,279
For you

1182
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:04,863
As we add sensors to everything it feels like we can do

1183
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,143
Much higher resolution

1184
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,679
Pictures of the world around us

1185
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,215
When it comes to

1186
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,007
Environmental monitoring

1187
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,799
Public Safety

1188
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,615
You stink

1189
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:19,967
Guess I guess I feel like we have this idea that we could get perfect information

1190
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:25,087
Know the near future

1191
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,183
How realistic do you think that is

1192
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
On the ground with

1193
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
Information

1194
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
Trying to react

1195
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,815
I think it's at the dream

1196
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,095
And the vision

1197
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:42,495
There I mean especially when you think about it to you in general I think the dream in the vision is right I think that people are

1198
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:46,591
Potentially under estimating the difficulty of getting there

1199
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
And

1200
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:53,247
It is pretty hard work because I think when you think about you know we like to say another teach Community oh great we just

1201
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,783
Weirdest magic wand is this

1202
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,111
Every device that's connected everywhere suddenly smart and connect

1203
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,927
With the internet and the reality is that is easier

1204
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,463
Said than done I mean

1205
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:08,095
The power consumption of adding microprocessors to every device is not insignificant

1206
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,679
Getting the number of devices out there is

1207
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,007
Actor and when you look at the electric consumption

1208
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,567
Adjustive running things you never so used to having

1209
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:23,455
The internet you know how to fingertips and being able to connect with any device and any website you know globally but

1210
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,503
I saw stop the other day that's just

1211
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:30,111
Is the internet itself was a country it would be the fifth largest consumer of

1212
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:36,511
Electricity to the actual tactical difficulty of getting a huge number of sensors and

1213
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,047
Movie theater around 3

1214
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
Weekly and processing it in real

1215
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,679
To get that kind of real high you know how most sort of

1216
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:46,239
Hey I like you know intelligence in the network

1217
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,263
I think is

1218
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,567
The great concept that we should shoot for

1219
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,359
But I think a lot of practitioners are just

1220
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,383
Under estimating

1221
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,943
How much elbow grease and hard work and cost

1222
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,735
Dress together

1223
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:03,391
Definition of iot in general is a little bit more like putting an astronaut on Mars that it is like putting a

1224
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:07,487
We should go there but it's an orders of magnitude harder than

1225
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,727
Alright thank you so much for

1226
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,495
For coming on the show

1227
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:19,775
Really appreciate

1228
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,567
My pleasure glad to be here

1229
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,383
That's all for this week's Internet of Things podcast

1230
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:30,783
Remember if you want more iot news please sign up for my newsletter at Stacey on iot

1231
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,879
Tom thanks for listening and we'll see you next week
