00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,360
Cohoes

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,896
Kevin tofel

7
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,480
I don't actually know why I guess I'm also a co-host if you're my host Kevin

8
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,248
Right

9
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,040
I don't know I don't know

10
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:27,648
It works either way regardless of who's hosting

11
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,672
We're on iTunes.

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,000
You stole my thunder

13
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,280
OK congratulation

14
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,096
Yes we are on iTunes now at the Internet of Things

15
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:36,864
Podcast

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,192
We have a lovely blue logo that you guys are familiar with if you

17
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,984
Grab this podcast on the website

18
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
I'm so

19
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,336
Go put your RSS feeders the right way

20
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,104
Or your

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,176
Your aunt oddcast a pin

22
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,736
On your iOS device or whatever you use

23
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,784
However you get to

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
Now you can get to it on ice

25
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648
All right

26
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,952
So on to the meat of the show

27
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,232
We will not spend the whole

28
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,000
Nothing celebrating

29
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,792
Scuba Stars

30
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,352
We did that before the show for an hour

31
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,960
Also unfortunately

32
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
I probably won't

33
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
All right

34
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,128
Will start the show with

35
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,200
Let's see let's start the show is shopping because

36
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,480
It's so fun

37
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,272
Everybody loves a shot

38
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,576
Send the shopping front

39
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,624
Connected devices is Target

40
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,416
The day after Memorial Day

41
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
May 26th

42
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,000
We shall see in Target stores

43
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,280
A new

44
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,328
Home automation Center

45
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,400
I we know actually that it will host a

46
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:46,752
Piper home all-in-one home security system but we don't know what else is going to be in there

47
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
8 feet of shelf Space 2

48
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
Other home automation products

49
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
That is very good because that is a sign of a further sign I guess I should say of the home automation

50
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,088
Smart home sector going more mainstream

51
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
Do you want to do

52
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,184
Cooler Simon is going mainstream I picked up a market

53
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,464
Stewart Living

54
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
And you know what was in it

55
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
Was like eight devices that will

56
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,888
Save you money and make your home smarter and it was like the August locks

57
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,424
There's a Dropcam

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
There they were

59
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,776
I didn't recognize the thermostat they had chosen

60
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
But

61
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,384
There were several devices that we talked about on the show and I was like

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
Go Martha

63
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:30,016
I'm guessing she didn't have August locks where she was before she came back out of

64
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
Wonder Man

65
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,368
Do not talk to not speak ill of Martha

66
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,720
Don't don't the backtalk don't sass the most but do not

67
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
August lock when she was in prison August was

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
Interjet

69
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
I know I know

70
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
Now has an

71
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
Home automation section

72
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
I will say

73
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:53,568
As someone who visits the home automation section in her local Staples

74
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
And

75
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
Home Depot a lot

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,408
I'm going to hope

77
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
That

78
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
Target keeps there's a little bit better stock

79
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,576
Dehumanization section in my Home Depot is

80
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
Constantly

81
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
Picked over and

82
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:12,512
A lot of the time it's an incap and it mostly has the wink products and then

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,376
The Nest stuff in the rest of stuff is kind of spread throughout the store I find

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,960
And I've been in my Staples and I've looked around and

85
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,008
You know it looks like they have

86
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,056
The right idea with the hole

87
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,360
Cluster of smart home stuff but

88
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
It just

89
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,224
Doesn't it just kind of feel like it's tucked in a corner to me all the time and yes it's a little

90
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,856
In disarray when everytime I go as well so like I don't quite understand that but

91
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,184
I was hoping it was Staples has the stuff

92
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
Actually hooked into like a

93
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
I'm trying to think of the words

94
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,424
There's a demo area kind of like so you can press buttons and make lights go on and what not I was the one wanted that I visit

95
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,544
So that's that's actually nice Home Depot doesn't seem to have a lot of Education

96
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
So

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
And I haven't actually been to Best Buy

98
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
In Forever

99
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
So I have to go check out Best Buy

100
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
This in Target's wants it stopped

101
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
Report back on who has the best

102
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,320
Retail experience for the smartphone

103
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,648
That's a good idea you guys can also tell us

104
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,952
Your thoughts at info

105
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
Iot podcast. Com

106
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
All right moving to our next order of

107
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
News

108
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
Let's talk about

109
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Collector cars Kevin

110
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,239
Oh yeah there's a sexy topic for you because

111
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:32,639
It is interesting most of the of the gross now for the carrier's is not coming from smartphones because hey pretty much everybody

112
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
We have one in the US

113
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
Tablets that are actually the big

114
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,879
Addition I guess when you look at net subscribers and left in the first quarter of the year and we have some data for

115
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,207
Good buddy Chetan Sharma you just had his quarterly

116
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
Us mobile market

117
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Date

118
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
I came out

119
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,327
And some interesting bits that

120
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,351
Came out

121
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,423
To my eyes were that machine-to-machine

122
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
Connections and car connections

123
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,079
Accounted for 39% of the total net additions for all the carriers

124
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,407
And who's the leader here it looks like it's AT&T which

125
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,479
Probably not a surprise if people have read our past coverage

126
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,271
Over the years of

127
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
M2M stuff with

128
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,135
AT&T connected car business will be a billion dollar

129
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,695
Revenue generator this year says chatting

130
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
And

131
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
That's pretty impressive attack

132
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:26,399
Out of the 1.2 million Wireless net additions in the first three months of this year

133
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191
684000

134
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Were cars

135
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,287
Which was 62% of their total net add so

136
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,103
That's a big deal I mean a billion dollar

137
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
Revenue generator right there

138
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,455
Yes and that was a lot of numbers right there

139
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
That's a billion dollars out of

140
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,855
The whole cell phone industry or AT&T is total

141
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
Do you have AT&T is total

142
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
Revenue for the quarter

143
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
Or for the year

144
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,047
I don't have it for the year

145
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,375
I do not have it for the years I don't know what percentage of This Is Us

146
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
I was looking at it more along the lines of

147
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,519
You don't currently it's if the biggest cruise driver and their net additions

148
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
It is certainly big

149
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
I'm not going to say

150
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,639
AT&T has clients like Tesla

151
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
So

152
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
I would buy a Tesla

153
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,015
Although I will say

154
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
Having I am kind of shopping around for a new car

155
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,135
And actually just last week

156
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Boa

157
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,951
Obama administration or rather

158
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
The department of

159
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
Asportation actually

160
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
Fast Track

161
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,583
The vehicle to vehicle

162
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
Wireless communication

163
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Which is

164
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
It's it's in the

165
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
Wi-Fi band

166
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
Turn the upper levels to Wi-Fi Beyond

167
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,591
And it's basically a wireless communication protocol

168
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,383
It's going to let cars

169
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,407
Talk to each other

170
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,735
And basically the idea is they'll be able to say like

171
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
I'm here I'm here

172
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
Don't hit me don't hit me

173
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
And ideas

174
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
They're going to mandate this

175
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,415
Come into vehicles

176
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,975
Starting in 2017

177
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
And then

178
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
Delta start adding it into vehicles

179
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
It's going to be awhile before that is

180
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
Real

181
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,959
So there's car-to-car talking so that's Vita V is what they're calling it

182
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,007
There's vehicle-to-infrastructure

183
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
And that's like

184
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Cars talking

185
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
Signs

186
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Toll booth

187
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Some cells

188
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,967
That'll dovetails with the autonomous cars though that's

189
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
Way down the line

190
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
I think it in terms of mainstream

191
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,647
But in the meantime there's a nice stepping stone to get the car's a little bit smarter so that

192
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,719
When one of them that's three cars ahead of you suddenly breaks

193
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,047
The cars behind it already know even if the driver can't see that

194
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Gdb

195
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
It actually Dia caddies

196
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:39,263
The caddy CTS with a fancy high and Cadillacs will actually have Vita vea

197
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
In those cars

198
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
Start in 2017

199
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
Sober as a

200
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,663
Person who right now in

201
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,759
In 2015 and maybe the 2016 models is looking at cars

202
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
I'm looking at all this technology

203
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:56,671
Even even LTE and trying to look at like what kind of car tag is going to be there

204
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:01,023
I'm like holy cow maybe I should start leasing my vehicle cuz

205
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
My Korean car

206
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:07,423
Which element guys I bought it in 2005 doesn't even have Bluetooth

207
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
And I've had it for 10 years now

208
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
I'm like Oh my goodness

209
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:16,639
If I keep my next car that I buy you know in 2016 for 10 years

210
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
Be like a dinosaur

211
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,759
All the other cars are going to be talking at talking about it behind its back

212
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,343
Bluetooth that's like so 2006 I mean come on

213
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,647
We're talking about car to car WiFi

214
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,487
So just think about that I am curious and I'll let you guys know is

215
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,047
This journey for a new car Progressive

216
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
But the wireless tech

217
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
In the car connectivity

218
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,191
Even even talking to you

219
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,239
Getting getting my wireless access

220
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
It's kind of complicated

221
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
I'm leaving bye

222
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,991
That's a good question. Cuz and it's funny because I release on the 2013 Chevy Volt actually runs out in October

223
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
Uber so we're going to be looking at something

224
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
And chances are really look at

225
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
2016 volt

226
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
With the new

227
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
I can look at a tattoo

228
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
It's new it's new

229
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
Redesigned

230
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,071
Has a fake V seat in the back but that's not going to go there right now, but more importantly

231
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
More battery range and so on and

232
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,447
Eric nicely with our solar panels on the roof I just don't

233
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,495
Know if they have

234
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,055
4G LTE Connections in there I think

235
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,615
General Motors has been pretty hot and heavy on that though

236
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
They have I am

237
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
I'm pretty sure it does

238
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,759
I get it I don't know I don't know if I want another bill

239
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
That that is

240
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
Yeah

241
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,415
All right so we will discuss that I'm sure in the future

242
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
In the meantime

243
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
Let's talk about

244
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,071
This crazy dude this is more businesstech but we're going to talk about how

245
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
It might apply to

246
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Consumer home

247
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Which is

248
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
Honeywell

249
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Command wall

250
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
I think this is

251
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,591
I think this is like really cool but I also think this is overkill

252
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
And so

253
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
What this is

254
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,175
Honeywell on Tuesday

255
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
Announced a

256
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:02,367
Who called they call it this man while I look at is like the touchscreen that's in Minority Report or any other science fiction

257
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,695
The movie where you get the characters and they're facing this giant

258
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
Screen in there just like

259
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,327
Blinking data left and right in the funny video screen and things are popping up

260
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
It's amazing

261
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
That is exactly what the

262
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,215
And the cool thing about it is

263
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,055
It's infinitely customizable and you pull in

264
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,359
Data it's design for commercial buildings

265
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,943
They got it customers right now who are trying it include

266
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,503
Landmark skyscrapers

267
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
Data centers Airport

268
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
Hospitals

269
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
These customers are integrating

270
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Bear

271
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,743
Access control so there sit there security systems

272
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
There

273
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
Video camera feed

274
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
Basic HVAC stuff to

275
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
Yes sensor data HVAC

276
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,727
Employee records in there other like

277
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:55,359
Their own customer files in their also bringing in outside data like Google Maps data or

278
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,431
Files they might get from like law enforcement or

279
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
Publicly available Act

280
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,111
They're pulling it all this data to create basically their own Dash

281
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
And

282
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
Kind of amazing

283
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
To see it now

284
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,327
It it actually isn't surprising that is coming from Honeywell

285
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,423
For one because I wouldn't call them a cutting-edge it type company

286
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
I watch the video maybe we can link to in the show notes

287
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:27,103
It's really neat because all of these different smart devices and door sensors and such

288
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:32,479
You just tap on them like say you tap on an icon of a video camera and boom the feed just pops up right there

289
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:37,087
There's all these little touch points in and information flowing all over the place here in

290
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:42,463
Yo I remember working in it and data centers for almost 15 years before I started writing and

291
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,327
You know I had a dashboard that may help me manage servers and routers and such but this is like

292
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,887
A hundred times beyond that I'm in this is this is just

293
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,191
Out there it looks really nice

294
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,263
And it's worth noting that Honeywell will work

295
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,871
It will work with Honeywell sensors but it'll also work with Honeywell competitors and

296
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
As for

297
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
The date of its pulling in it pulls it in VA

298
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
Barry's apis and it

299
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Attempts to pull it in

300
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Like from other data formats

301
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,183
It's crazy that it's coming from

302
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
Building management kind of

303
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
Bender

304
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,583
I'm as opposed to an IT company but maybe that's because

305
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
These guys don't have skin in the game

306
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,447
But I would love to see something like this

307
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
In my house

308
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,079
Best Buy sells a home hub system called the peak

309
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
And it has it actually

310
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,943
Similar user interface that can show you

311
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
Kind of what's happening in your home and they have a

312
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
Partnership with zube

313
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Which is

314
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
A device you can stick in your

315
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
Cars

316
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Diagnostics port

317
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
And that

318
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:51,327
Will show you where someone's car is in real time so if you have a teenage driver for example

319
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,375
You can see their car

320
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
From the dashboard

321
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
The peak

322
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
Witches

323
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
It's kind of this idea

324
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:04,895
Really cool if you could throw that up on kind of like your TV screen or just like a dedicated screen

325
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
In your house

326
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
Instead of having to go through the peak dashboard

327
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,575
And then maybe you could combine it with your Evernote shopping list or

328
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
You know any other system

329
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,975
Yeah I mean this is this is like a dashboard too. Oh and this is this is impressive

330
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
I've kind of really really excited

331
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
But maybe that's just

332
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,471
Me and my desire My Desire for customizable dashboards I'm surprised I'm really am I'm really surprised that we don't have something

333
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
It's already

334
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
It's kind of sad for

335
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
Well yummy when you see it it's like

336
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,199
It's like common sense I mean through all these things together get them talking to each other

337
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,039
Get the Data Vault easily touchable and viewable and everything else

338
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
Tok why is anybody else doing this

339
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,183
There is an app called numerous it's actually iOS only

340
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
And they

341
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
They pulling any

342
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
Number related data

343
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,839
And they throw it up on a tablet

344
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
Kind of Anna dashboard

345
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
So that's

346
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
Sort of like

347
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,495
That and I think they have some sort of

348
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
Watch integration

349
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
But

350
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Again

351
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Not nearly

352
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
Is open

353
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
Or

354
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
Seemingly is flexible

355
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
I have not played with this

356
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,391
I do not own it landmarks guys can a hospital or an airport

357
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
But

358
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
I would really like to

359
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,047
Will work on that will do a Kickstarter for you

360
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
Stacey would like to own an air

361
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,679
Honeywell Command Center

362
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,239
That's maybe I should just call Honeywell and see if I can get one

363
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,359
Maybe I haven't made it to let you take over somebody else's sky scraper for a day

364
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Salad nicoise

365
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
Rent a building

366
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
There we go

367
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
All right

368
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,319
Are we ready for our Innovative Lee named

369
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Segment

370
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
New segment

371
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
What's it called

372
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
It's the

373
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,719
5-minute review

374
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
Oh I like your

375
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
You do what you do are sounded

376
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,119
All right

377
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,143
Kevin I

378
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
You've got our

379
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Review of the week

380
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,775
I do it's it's actually a

381
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
Website and online database

382
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,359
As it were of

383
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,919
Smart Home Products and super useful

384
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:18,015
If you want to see it you want to go to smart home db.com

385
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
When you go there you'll see this

386
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
Online database of various

387
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
Home Smart Home components

388
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
Hubs

389
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,999
Product reviews

390
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
If there's all kinds of views

391
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
Citizens online database

392
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,911
They slice and dice is information anyway you want it so

393
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,703
Do you want to see what's compatible with

394
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,031
IOS or Android you can just click the compatibilities tab

395
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,615
Start picking up products and we'll tell you what works with your ear

396
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
Smartphone operating system for example

397
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:51,807
I'm thirsty does the same thing with apps with companies and just products in general that are related to Smart Homes

398
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
Also nice is

399
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,927
Product reviews by people who actually have bought these products

400
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:01,791
So we know you can take a look and see the Philips Hue Bridge has 4 and 1/4 Stars

401
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,607
I-25 and 103 people have reviewed it

402
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,191
If you want to see the compatibilities you can just click the little

403
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,471
NYX palette

404
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,287
Compatibilities works with graph

405
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
Clip app for any product which I just did for the Phillips

406
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
Hub

407
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,199
And now I've got this ginormous graph of all these different products that work with it from

408
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:23,551
Quirky and Staples and Phillips will of course cuz Phillips mix The Hub

409
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,855
Nest Lutron Belkin

410
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,183
So you can see before you actually buy Smart Home Products

411
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,231
You can actually kind of plan out

412
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
A little bit better I think

413
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,303
Because everything is right here

414
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,375
Easy what's compatible with what what products work with witch

415
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,935
Which have been highly rated which have been highly rated

416
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,727
There's prices for all of us

417
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
I'm so it said it's a

418
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,895
Really nice simple way of finding more information about your smartphone before you actually

419
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,943
Invest in your smart home is that make sense

420
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
It does

421
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,271
Although I wouldn't say that was a five-minute

422
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,111
I would also I would add that there is a

423
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
There's a section on

424
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,951
Cloud Server versus

425
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,303
Yes and no for those of you guys who hate sending your data to the cloud

426
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,351
This is actually kind of a nice little

427
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,655
Segment cuz I know there's a small

428
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,703
Or maybe it's a growing my majority I don't

429
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
What's a small minority actually

430
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,031
It might be growing

431
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,591
Keep their data on premise

432
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,663
And for those of you this actually gives you

433
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,967
The Limited number of products

434
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
And

435
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,623
Yeah so that way you can see if it's the Standalone product or it's based in

436
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
You know the cloud and you sharing data

437
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
Sew in

438
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:38,047
Kevin found this but I will say that actually this is been shared with me by like

439
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
Two or three people so

440
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,887
Thank you guys for sharing this with us

441
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
And

442
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,983
It is has a instruction set so

443
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
It's

444
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
It's really just a nice

445
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,591
It's a very nice

446
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
Kind of databases

447
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
Product to look at so

448
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,991
Check it out I will include it in the show notes for you

449
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
And

450
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,831
Hopefully you guys can spend hours

451
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
You can get lost in this thing

452
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:08,255
You can and you can spend probably a lot of money after getting lost

453
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
And

454
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Lord help you

455
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,167
So I think that's it for us this week

456
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,495
And stay tuned because we have an awesome guest we have robbed

457
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Coneybeare

458
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:26,175
And he is a partner at Shasta Ventures and we are talking about what devices will become

459
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:32,575
Connected and smart in which will stay decisively analog

460
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:38,975
Hey everybody we are back with the Internet of Things podcast and I have

461
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,303
A wonderful guest for us today it is Rob conybeare

462
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,143
Who is a managing director and co-founder at Shasta Ventures

463
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,471
To be here with you thanks for having me

464
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:54,591
I am so excited so I asked you on the show a couple weeks ago because you wrote

465
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,895
How do you say it's an amazing blog post

466
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
Switch

467
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:04,319
Might sound a little was called what will stay defiantly analog

468
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,367
Login in it you kind of analyzed

469
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,439
Basically what products are going to be connected and how those

470
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Look

471
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,815
And your three categories were do you remember them or do you want me to break it down for

472
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,399
We can go back through them but I'm happy to walkthrough am right now

473
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:22,751
3 word products it'll disappear in the digital age so if you think of newspapers

474
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,031
Stand-alone cameras

475
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:31,199
And at the other end of the spectrum of products that remain defiantly analog and that would be things like writing instruments and

476
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,271
Notebooks and you can see how many people still buy Moleskine

477
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
Notebooks today

478
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
It is between it's hard to say

479
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:42,975
There's a number of product selection literally but he'll become connected and evolved over time into

480
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
New category

481
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,327
To me the most exciting I I took issue with some of your things

482
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,887
You have some thoughts about the kitchen we're going to talk about

483
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,519
I I really wanted to kind of think about the things that become connected in a Volvo

484
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,591
Time which is where I imagine you're probably making a lot of your bets

485
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
What is a venture capitalist

486
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
Is that a fair assumption

487
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
That's absolutely true

488
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,759
So in this category

489
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,319
I think of it as a spectrum there's obviously

490
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,135
Right now I feel like we're adding intelligence

491
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
Products

492
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
That

493
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
Kind of on a one-off basis so

494
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
I'm thinking about things like my nest

495
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,559
Stir like my Philips Hue Lights.

496
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
Act alone

497
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,655
They provide some sort of value or energy

498
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
Payment

499
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,031
And then when I look in the future I start thinking like you mentioned that connected chairs

500
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,079
And I feel like those things

501
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,383
Probably gain more value

502
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,431
When they become part of an ecosystem

503
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,015
And I'm really excited about that but I'd be curious how do you kind of

504
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,039
See that

505
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
Evolution

506
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Products

507
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
I think initially

508
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:50,047
And for the next five maybe even 10 years you'll see silos continue to be the main way in which we see can

509
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
Divisive

510
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,935
I think part of it is because people tend to think

511
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959
That way

512
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
So

513
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:04,639
Right here in Silicon Valley you might get excited about the idea of cuz your thermostat talk to your son assistant talk to your garage

514
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,687
Talk to your coffee maker

515
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
But I think the reality is

516
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
It's the silence

517
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
People really care about it

518
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
I like to have music in my house

519
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,928
What I like to have a thermostat the program

520
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,536
And I think a lot of the other scenarios have drawbacks did

521
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,584
People don't really think through

522
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,888
And the reasons that you haven't seen

523
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:32,288
Companies that have been focused on building these ecosystems that you're referring to

524
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,360
And what are some of these drawbacks

525
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,408
But I can think of is a user

526
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,712
The hours I spend making things

527
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
Connected work together

528
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
There is probably a big drawback

529
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,576
From your perspective what are you thinking

530
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,904
I like to think about you

531
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,696
And I like to think about

532
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,560
How a consumer would really interact with the connected device so

533
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:58,144
One of the examples that funny examples that people like to use

534
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
Talking about the internet

535
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
Coffee maker

536
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,544
And it's ideas at your house can figure out when you wake up

537
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,128
When you're headed downstairs and automatically brew a cup of coffee for you

538
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,712
Turning on a coffee maker and starting it Brewing

539
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
It's only a

540
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
A small part of the problem

541
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
So

542
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,368
When I think about making a cup of coffee

543
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:26,304
I even if I'm using Keurig I still have to load the coffeemaker I have to put the package in there

544
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
Put a clean mug in there

545
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:35,008
If I'm using a coffee maker that grinds beans I have to fill it with game that's put a filter in Africa water in

546
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,896
That's about 95% of the problem the actual turning on the coffee maker is only 5% of the crop

547
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
And

548
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:47,040
I think about everyday 10 or 20 times I use the coffee maker

549
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,368
I'd much rather go down and turn it on

550
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
5 minutes

551
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
Before I actually need it

552
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,232
Then they have a 1 + 10 * 4

553
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,024
Even one in 20 times

554
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,328
Activated the wrong time

555
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,120
When I come down and I have a cold

556
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
Hi coffee

557
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,960
It's actually going to be two or three times

558
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,520
6 long to get the coffee as it would be otherwise

559
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,104
So when I look at something like that I start to thanks

560
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,176
What would be far more interesting is if the coffee maker

561
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,248
Is able to tell when I actually need to order more beans

562
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,784
Do things like that

563
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,576
In my view is really more of us

564
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,368
Sight word activities

565
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,928
Where the coffee maker is getting its materials

566
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
Supposed to react into other things

567
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
Smartphone

568
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,840
Got it okay so are you excited about the Amazon fulfillment

569
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
You take a look at the ideas

570
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Putting a little button on your

571
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,520
Washing machine

572
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,080
That's when the bottle starts to get empty

573
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,408
The bottle mic recorder so you could imagine

574
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
In 10 years

575
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,968
Get bottles

576
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,040
Free Wi-Fi built ending until in Ramsey but

577
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,600
He might not know where there's more bottles around the house

578
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
Replenishment button right there

579
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,744
Play Take a pretty interesting one and I think in a lot of areas

580
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
React

581
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,584
The Internet of Things

582
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,168
Starting to incorporate that into either buttons

583
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,984
Self replenishment services

584
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,776
Very interesting

585
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
Glimpse into the Future

586
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,872
So I like that I like the idea of replacement

587
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
Or kind of

588
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,480
So as opposed to just connecting things around your house

589
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,760
Connected object

590
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,576
To think about it as having kind of a replacement service Milton

591
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,904
I also am really excited about and I'm curious your thoughts on

592
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
Education so

593
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,024
And this is actually one of the reasons why I'm interested in the

594
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,304
Kitchen

595
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,168
In a coffee maker might not be a great example of this unless you ever really high end coffee maker

596
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
But

597
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,472
Devices

598
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
That

599
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,544
That know what they're doing and can

600
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
Can teach you

601
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,128
Or offer recipes or

602
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
Ways to

603
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,480
To improve your coffee so it in the coffee maker thing

604
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,528
Maybe my coffee maker

605
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,368
You don't give me my two shots of espresso and then it'll also

606
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,416
Because I told it I want

607
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,000
A latte it will tell me how much milk I need to put in there

608
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,816
How long I need to steam it and it what temperature

609
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
And all of those things could become

610
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,144
Immensely value

611
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,704
Especially

612
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,056
Midday Pick 10 but it ends up getting baked into an iPad or an iPhone

613
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
Next to that device

614
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,920
So you can opt into that information and you can do it but

615
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,736
To actually control the

616
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,528
Milk that goes in Turkey

617
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:31,136
Call the sugar that goes in independent of your measuring at yourself with a very very

618
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
Simple measuring device

619
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,744
Does devices have mechanical moving parts

620
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,840
Why you say you don't multi thousand-dollar

621
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,864
Espresso machine

622
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,912
Because they have a lot of moving parts inside

623
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,984
And being from Italy a lot of things break all the time

624
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,312
So I think in the connected kitchen

625
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
It's about

626
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,152
What are you trying to do what are you trying to solve

627
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
You still have to wash the pots

628
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,784
And you still have to order the food you still have to measure a lot of the food I think

629
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,112
Are Instagram models that are coming along like

630
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,136
4-H

631
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,672
Other companies

632
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,720
Deliver food in

633
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
And

634
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
Portion size for portion sizes

635
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,560
That makes sense

636
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,608
But at the same time

637
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
I think that

638
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
Studious

639
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,936
Relatively

640
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:20,032
Inexpensive it is an area where the artistry

641
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,080
Anna high social element

642
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,384
Did I think people really enjoying

643
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,688
That's that's why I have some Skeptics

644
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,992
Says I'm about the speed at which you see that

645
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,552
Connect to Kitchen really start to take off

646
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,624
I understand like I agree with

647
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
A lot of fat

648
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
I guess I see things

649
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:42,304
I see because I like to cook so much I see a generation of

650
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,376
Friends of mine for example in people who are even younger

651
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,192
Who don't know how to cook and I see

652
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
Things like

653
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,056
Meld is a good example of to Kickstarter for

654
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,848
It's both a

655
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,152
A knob that you put on your stove

656
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,944
And a temperature

657
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,224
The thermometer that you

658
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,504
Dropping a pot

659
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552
And what it does is it

660
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
In conjunction with your iPad

661
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,648
It tells you basically how hot

662
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
Something is

663
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,720
On your stove and then

664
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,304
You tell it what you're making and it tells you kind of it controls the

665
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
The temperature out

666
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:21,728
I'm trying to think of what that is that

667
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
We all have

668
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
Say hey

669
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,336
Turn the oven to 375 degrees

670
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,664
And we all know that that oven could be anywhere from 300

671
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,224
25 degrees to 425 degrees

672
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,760
Or

673
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,552
The temperature of the burner

674
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,600
1 stove I put it at

675
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
Medium

676
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
I put it at Lowe's

677
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,696
The same amount of heat

678
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,976
Question 2

679
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
I guess that you're trying to cook

680
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,840
That type of problem

681
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:52,448
She better and better tools but they're still similar tools they're their measurement

682
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
Tools

683
00:27:53,984 --> 00:28:00,128
But the idea of automating more the process of cooking as opposed to improving individual

684
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,408
Tools

685
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
Skepticism

686
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
Oh okay

687
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,344
Yeah cuz I could think of I can think of dozens of tools that I would be so excited to have

688
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,392
A little bit more intelligence in

689
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,464
And we're not quite there yet cuz I don't think the

690
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:21,632
The connectivity and the intelligence is it cheap enough yet but you know I would love a spoon that can measure viscosity so when I'm

691
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,680
You know a sausage

692
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,216
To be like okay now we're there

693
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,992
Looking at a stove

694
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
You can see all the variations

695
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,392
The idea of being able to build devices

696
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
Get a very accurate

697
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,208
Reputable

698
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,816
Better knives better spoons better dishes

699
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,096
Call those things

700
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,680
Okay we'll see we we weren't so far off

701
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,568
Same time you're not going to see a cheese grater go away

702
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,872
Which is a decidedly low-tech device

703
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,664
Oh no

704
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:11,040
Preparation preparation

705
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
The moment at which

706
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,368
Cut it or slice it open it up

707
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Is when your

708
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:20,000
Releasing flavors and Aromas and all the things that make cooking so magical

709
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,096
It's true although I would love a little bit more high-tech

710
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
Built into my

711
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
Kitchen

712
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,936
And this is something I

713
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:32,032
I've no idea for get there but I was reading about Ikea actually has

714
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
A

715
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,336
I wouldn't call it an RF

716
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,872
Pee but they have like a vision

717
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
For the connected kitchen

718
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:41,504
And one of the things they're showing off and I'll be very clear for everyone listening

719
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,296
This does not exist today

720
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,088
This is something Ikea's talking about

721
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,368
I'm looking for

722
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,184
One of the things they were showing was something like

723
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
A smarter countertop

724
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,000
So it is

725
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,304
It kinda had a sense of what you were putting on it

726
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,912
Either through a computer and a projector like a camera and a projector kind of set up that said

727
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
This is a fish

728
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,032
And then it would project things onto the fish that said like

729
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,056
Here's how you're going to

730
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
Deponent

731
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,384
It's something like that

732
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,176
That would be hugely value

733
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,992
As

734
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,808
The reality of where those things

735
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
Today would be a lot like

736
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:24,000
Those are probably 40-50 years out the technologies that would be able to track where the fishes and then put the donation

737
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
Information

738
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:28,608
Projected onto the fish is a ways out I think fit

739
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:35,008
Some of the visions that people have for the kitchen right now or a lot like when people are expecting self-driving cars back in the

740
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,592
60's hits till about another 50 years old

741
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
50 whole year

742
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,176
Alright well

743
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,736
That's that's really depressing

744
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,528
Let's talk about things that

745
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,320
You think will disappear

746
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:52,416
There's a couple things that I I would love to get your thoughts on so

747
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Books

748
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,512
Are they are they going to disappear remain defiantly and

749
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,584
That's a very interesting one because

750
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,632
They do have the advantage of

751
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,704
Instant good time but that's going away this

752
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,520
The thing that I like about books in the thing that I do

753
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,312
When I read books has I like

754
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
2

755
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,872
Annotate physically

756
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,992
And it's been very hard for me to get used to the idea of using Amazon to annotate so

757
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,296
When I use a Kindle

758
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,344
I can see who else is

759
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,648
Annotated to give him section I can see

760
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,720
Comments that people might have made there's all sorts of interesting

761
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:31,840
Advantages to the hive mind so to speak when you're working with textbooks and other things

762
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,448
I think both have a much longer tail than what you see with newspapers right now

763
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,496
Because when people

764
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
Look at that object

765
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,872
When I'm in my library at home that's absolutely filled and stuff

766
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:49,760
When I look at that book it brings a memory back in a way that I've never get in a digital domain

767
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:54,880
And it inspires me and helps me think about other things so it's the physical artifact

768
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,928
But I think people find

769
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
Interesting and appealing

770
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,512
At the same time

771
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,096
A lot of that is just how I think about quotes and I interact

772
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
And

773
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,192
What I find with my kids my young kids

774
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,728
They

775
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,544
Between both mode

776
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,896
Stay still enjoy enjoy picking up physical books and reading books

777
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,944
Very very

778
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,992
Seamlessly move over using it

779
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,784
Kindle as well and

780
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
They really don't

781
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
Cure to have a preference

782
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Between one another

783
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,416
And I think it's

784
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,976
The Arc I think it's the tactile

785
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,256
Temptation of a book

786
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,584
That is very different than a newspaper because it has a life

787
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,376
Beyond when you read it

788
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,472
You go back you reference a look at it later having you around has meaning

789
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:45,312
Newspapers and other disposable periodicals

790
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,104
You don't have that same interaction

791
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,152
It's true although

792
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
We had a paper mache project that was

793
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:55,808
Do and suddenly realized that we had absolutely nothing far paper mache project

794
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,624
Oh no I know I'd like

795
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
What will happen to the

796
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
Kids of the future

797
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:08,608
When you think about it books have a lot of things going for him the newspapers don't because even today news Prince comes off and

798
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
Your hands and

799
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:13,472
Target open up when you sit down in an airplane in a tiny seed

800
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
Oh yeah

801
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,848
Issues I think that people have with newspaper

802
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,896
You don't quite have with books

803
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,200
So I think there'll be a lot of physical artifacts

804
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,480
You stay around but it

805
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,296
It'll be a good thing to see NFC and

806
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,392
Maybe not as much mass produced as many Masters

807
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,696
We're going to go down at list

808
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
A quick little list

809
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,512
Okay

810
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,536
I've got some ideas

811
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,328
I'm ready you ready

812
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,608
All right

813
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,888
Jewelry

814
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
It's Kind of a Funny

815
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,240
Yes why I think Julia Pfeiffer

816
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,312
Navigate into two categories and one of them is fine jewelry

817
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,872
And the other is fashion

818
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,968
And when you think about things that are fashionable these things fit

819
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
Typically

820
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,064
People wear for a year or two or three

821
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,624
And I think that's a little more

822
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,416
Tune to

823
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,976
The light cycle of technology in advance

824
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Technology

825
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,816
When I think about fine jewelry and I think about

826
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,632
Things that are artistic

827
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,960
There's an expectation when you buy it or you just it

828
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,776
You'll be using it

829
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
4

830
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Decades

831
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,616
Whether that's true or not

832
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
That's a bit of the expectation

833
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
And

834
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:31,040
Part of the way you talk about the phrase diamonds are forever

835
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,320
And

836
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,344
You look at

837
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,904
The way that people interact with these

838
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,488
Items in the way that they build on top of it

839
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,560
I think this was fine jewelry people don't want

840
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,352
Literal picture

841
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
They want

842
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
The

843
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
Positive

844
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:53,056
Sometimes negative emotions that come along with it it's still in your mind and there is much more of an arc

845
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,592
Please do it so

846
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,640
When I think about jewelry that's how I

847
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,432
I think about that category

848
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,968
Current that makes sense

849
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
What about

850
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,296
This it this encompasses a lot of things

851
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,856
So we can break it down further but building materials

852
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,416
That's a good one

853
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,744
I think you start to see something that happened with technology

854
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
Such as

855
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,536
Chalkboard

856
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:20,960
So you start to see advances in technology we can have paint that looks the same on whiteboard paint that allows you to write on it

857
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,520
I think those are some things that happen with physical characteristic

858
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
On the other hand

859
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,104
You look at the door

860
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:34,016
The door is stayed defiantly analog for a very long time hinges work well the idea of being able to pull out a pen

861
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,552
To be able to remove a door

862
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,624
These are things that work particularly well

863
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:44,768
And I think we'll continue to work well for a very long time I don't think we're going to see the Star Trek sliding doors

864
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,608
Make monkey noises every time they slide open anytime

865
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:52,960
Or Worse the depressing door is out of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

866
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,056
No it's the same time I think you will start to

867
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
See

868
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,616
Companies like August

869
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,896
Lockitron

870
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
And

871
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
Unikey

872
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,760
People that are building internet-connected locks

873
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,088
I think there's a lot of utility to be had there I think he'll start

874
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
See more and more of that

875
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,904
And there are

876
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
So many doors

877
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,000
Somebody access points but that can be an enormous Market

878
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
Like to see the really

879
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,352
Mainstream adoption I think you need to

880
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:25,728
About another 5 to 10 years of reliability built into these devices

881
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,800
Because there's nothing worse than getting

882
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,360
Locked out of your house because the batteries might have died

883
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,200
Like I got locked out of my house all the time

884
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
Keys

885
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,760
Batteries connectivity at all

886
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:38,784
It doesn't matter

887
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,576
So I'm like whatever

888
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,392
What about you what about things like

889
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,208
I feel like windows are kind of an interesting

890
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,768
Interesting thing to think about maybe not

891
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,424
803 years for now but maybe 10 years from now just because in some ways they're kind of like a screen opportunity

892
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,704
I I don't know I

893
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
I have no idea what you're

894
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:03,104
If anything at all

895
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,408
Anytime you start to put something

896
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,712
Physical and then you start to think about

897
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,504
Cost of installation

898
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,320
At least run adventure capitalist point of view

899
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,856
Start to get a little frightening

900
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,440
Because it starts become Capital intensive

901
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
To inform people

902
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,328
And teach people about the benefits that you could have from

903
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,400
New windows are building materials like that

904
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,704
One of the things I've done in my house is

905
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,520
Put on 3M protective coatings

906
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,824
To reduce the UV

907
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:40,224
Protect are also to help with heating and cooling bills

908
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,272
But that's something that you can apply after

909
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,832
Retrofit Easley

910
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:50,208
And I think anything that's in Material Science is better suited to large companies spend

911
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,768
Got it in you and your

912
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,584
Your post you actually talked about furniture so

913
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,424
But let's talk about furniture we also mentioned Ikea and they're sticking

914
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,960
Charging stuff

915
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,776
Charging pads into their furniture and I know I

916
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,568
I got Kickstarter all the time and

917
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,872
I see some really interesting furniture

918
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:13,504
USB cables built in

919
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
The things that are

920
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Suited

921
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,112
To The Internet of Things Memorial stamp first

922
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,160
I wear your solving

923
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,440
Really clear

924
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,000
Problems that people have so I think something like

925
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:28,608
The Nest thermostat and being an early investor they're one of the things that we saw was

926
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,424
You could go into a single point products

927
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
Connected to the internet

928
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,544
And you can pay for itself within a year along with all the other benefits

929
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,336
Will you look at

930
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,616
Something like

931
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,456
Looking at a leather chair right now

932
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,736
It might cost

933
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,552
As much as 500,000 $2,000

934
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:51,136
My expectation is a less that chair for 20 or 30 years

935
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,304
And I think that a lot of these charging devices and things that people think about building into Furniture in about

936
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,144
For five years is going to look like having an 8-track player in your car

937
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,936
Especially Theron Apple charger

938
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,848
And everything that's around you I think it's about

939
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,384
Mapping

940
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:16,224
The life cycle of that product to the life cycle of Technology

941
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,040
So if you have a product that you have next

942
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,112
Station that you use for anywhere from 1 to 3 years

943
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,160
That's where you'll start

944
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,440
She technology

945
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:31,584
If it's something where the advantages are just so overwhelmingly powerful like what you see in a thermostat

946
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,424
Put an item that you expect to have for 2030

947
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,984
Years are longer than 10 years

948
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,520
I don't think it's a

949
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:45,664
Place that you're going to see them be anything other than Analog Devices and backdrops for other products

950
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:49,504
So this will be our final question our final product category

951
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,040
Clothing

952
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,344
Clothing that's a good one

953
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,648
Well ask you how long do you

954
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
Clothes for

955
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,744
Woke up with fashion versus fine clothing

956
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:04,096
It's it's a similar it's a similar divide maybe not as long as a diamond ring but

957
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,144
But I think in general clothing

958
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,192
If you wear a regular later we're up

959
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Clothing

960
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:09,984
Design

961
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,520
Only designed for

962
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,336
30 40 50 Washings before they really start

963
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
Come apart in general

964
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,712
It it's true and indefinitely when you go in

965
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,016
There are things I buy that

966
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:26,112
Like my Summer shirts and shorts those will probably last me

967
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,648
A summer maybe two

968
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:33,280
But like a fine like a suit or something like that or if I'm going to buy something by a designer

969
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,816
I expect that to last me

970
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,840
Probably a decade

971
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,424
Because

972
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
Where

973
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:45,568
You will see technology overtime but the price points have to get down to a point where if you

974
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,408
Incorporated into the clothing itself it has to be

975
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
Vanishingly

976
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,480
Inexpensive cell

977
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,808
I think the only reason that you won't see it on a broad scale

978
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,344
Anytime soon

979
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,904
It's just the cost of the technology and

980
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,208
I need to recharge I think

981
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,608
At the point that you're able to do energy Scavenging and wifi-only cost you a few pennies

982
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,632
2

983
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
Carmen

984
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,216
They might start to see that sort of thing

985
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,544
I've had the experience with a a shirt that

986
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,616
Edward at South by Southwest on your neck of the woods

987
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,152
2 years ago that had a

988
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,712
Graphic equalizer on the front and a batteries

989
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,760
And would actually

990
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
React

991
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,808
The music

992
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:32,672
And whatever venue I went to it South by Southwest and it was a huge hit love wearing it

993
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,488
I think you'll start to see some of these things

994
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,512
I'm into fashion

995
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,816
But it's an area where I think

996
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:42,656
Points make it very difficult unless you have a very unique

997
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:46,496
Reason that you're using it such as Fitness or or some other purpose

998
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,360
Yeah I think Fitness and I think also an interesting use cases things like

999
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
Health Lake

1000
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,479
It'll sunsun tracking UV tracking is a really kind of interesting

1001
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,783
An example especially like kids clothing

1002
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,111
So when you look at something like that then you ask whether it's

1003
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,903
Better for it to be

1004
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,255
A highly effective state-of-the-art sensor that you clip onto the clothing

1005
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,839
Survivor run through the wash if you forget to take it off

1006
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,911
Is opposed to something that you would add to every piece of clothing

1007
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,471
The kids has it might not be as good as sensor

1008
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:23,103
Well it in that is the question but some of those some of those clips are very expensive and I'm thinking of

1009
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:28,991
Like a rash guard that I put on my kid every time they go out to the beach when I'm most concerned about it might be

1010
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,903
Interesting way to go see them building

1011
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,743
Measurements of your form and Effectiveness when you work out

1012
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:44,095
Areas where you have time and you're trying to make the most of your time and

1013
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,983
It's much more measurable it's something that people will pay for and pay more for us in it

1014
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,263
Guess I certainly

1015
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,847
I certainly don't need my everyday clothes telling me I'm slouching on the regular

1016
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127
Yeah

1017
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,199
All these categories is

1018
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,503
Part of the human condition is

1019
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,063
Spitting up in manipulating and working with

1020
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:08,415
And touching and interacting with devices in our everyday lives

1021
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:13,535
And so much of our world I think whether we feel it or not is about creativity it's

1022
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,631
3D sidewalk on this side of the street of that side of the street or

1023
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,983
What do we want to have for breakfast or how do we want to cook it and what do we want to do and I think

1024
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,519
Art's Place

1025
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,823
And creativity plays much bigger

1026
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,615
Part of our daily lives

1027
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,967
I think because of that that's where you'll see the tension between

1028
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,271
Silicon Valley that wants to

1029
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,551
Automate everything

1030
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,111
Connect everything to technology and

1031
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,927
Areas where I think you'll see

1032
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,231
Thanks the analog four

1033
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,767
Decades if not centuries

1034
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
And I think

1035
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:53,471
That's a wonderful topic that we could probably explain a whole nother podcast because I think actually some of the stuff opens up

1036
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:57,311
A lot of opportunities to be creative and completely different ways

1037
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,871
For people who want to explore that like I

1038
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,175
I had a fun time building a

1039
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,991
Pressure sensor into one of my chairs and

1040
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
Tying a tie

1041
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:10,367
Distance you lightbulb so when you sat in that chair and only that chair the light above your head

1042
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,391
Pokemon

1043
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,463
It was silly but it was kind of a fun party trick

1044
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,791
Actually measures how much that person

1045
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,375
No no that would be a terrible chair

1046
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:25,215
No one wants that are displayed above the refrigerator

1047
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,239
Can you imagine

1048
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,519
I can't

1049
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,335
No one would visit me again

1050
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
All right

1051
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,455
Brought thank you so much for coming on the podcast

1052
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,807
I love that post I think it's a must-read for everyone all included in the show notes

1053
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
And

1054
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
Thank you

1055
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:48,767
Call Stacy thanks for having me on the show it's been a great conversation

1056
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:55,167
I will see you next week on the Internet of Things podcast
