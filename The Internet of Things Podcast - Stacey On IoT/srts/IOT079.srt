Amazing news this week

00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,856
All the Google Hardware announcements stuff

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
We have

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,160
Iot botnets

11
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:32,000
We have a new survey from the online trust Alliance it's going to tell you how to

12
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,280
Protect your smart home

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,072
We have a bunch of dues bits

14
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:41,728
And we have a wonderful guest but first we're going to have Hewlett Packard Enterprises tell us a little bit about their analytics at the edge

15
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:46,080
And then we're going to have Danny hertzberg a Miami Beach realtor talk about

16
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,640
How to invest in your smart home

17

So

18
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,456
Before we get started

19
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,504
Let's hear word from our sponsor

20

25
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Dot-com

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,968
Okay and now to the show

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,992
Kevin

28
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,272
Let's start off with

29
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,064
Your disclaimer since we're going to

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,832
Shake It Off with goo

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,744
Oh that's right I do have to say that so I do work for Google I do not work in their smart home area which is obvious

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
Talk about and all opinions are my own not my employers

33
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,912
And I know that they're sending you some dollars under the

34
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
Atlantic Avenue

35
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:50,336
Well they're probably been paying me too because I'm really excited about what we saw it

36
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
So Google

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
Announce the whole slew

38
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,688
New pixel phones

39
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,272
Those look lovely but we're not going to talk much about those cuz we're not a phone show

40
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,112
They also announced a new router called Google Wi-Fi

41
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
And

42
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,768
Google home the much-talked-about competitor to the Amazon Echo so it is a personal assistant

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
And speaker

44
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,448
Yeah the end Google home actually was introduced at Google IO back in May of this year so now that Prada

45
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
What is actually

46
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,544
Available yet they can pre-order I believe

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,944
You can pre-order it it's $129 it comes with these like swappable bases so it's a it's an air freshener

48
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,760
Color coded base for

49
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
The Hive speaker

50
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,856
If the smell of iot in the morning

51
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,744
Mine I ordered it yesterday mine is estimated to arrive

52
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
November 8th

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,704
What do you what do you think of the pricing and the reason I asked is because obviously the Echo goes for $180.

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
This is 130

55
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,544
But of course Amazon recently

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,616
Did the dot 2.0 for $49

57
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,224
So I will have to wait and see how the speaker sounds

58
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,040
But I feel like the echo is now to expand

59
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,624
Just like if you're if you know nothing about the products

60
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
And again I still haven't lived with

61
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
The product I think

62
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,768
Really important to say yes

63
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
The echo

64
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
Could be

65
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Price too high

66
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,632
And but what I imagine is

67
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,168
We're going to see some amazing black

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,728
Videos were Cyber Monday on Amazon

69
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
Tuesday

70
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
Whatever

71
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
Captain's coming into the holiday

72
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:32,736
And folks can always find referral to recertify decos probably for like 1:40 to 1:15 to save a few bucks anyway at any

73
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
Yes

74
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,088
So let's dig into some of the things that I was like

75
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,904
Oh this is cool and then some of the things that I was like

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
This is missing

77
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,816
Talk about the missing because you ordered one of these and I did not

78
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
Yok we should ask why do

79
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
Fort Irwin

80
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
Well the main reason is that

81
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,800
I've been a huge proponent and fan and user of the Google

82
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,872
OK Google services I'm sorry I just turned everybody's feeling on it

83
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
I apologize

84
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:06,016
We should okay before you get into this we need and create a code word like she who shall not be named

85
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
Bi-Rite cuz I'm getting a lot of complaints

86
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
So what should we do this

87
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
The G-Man

88
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
No cuz it's a woman 2

89
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,512
Assistant can we just call it

90
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
We'll just we'll just call you Google Assistant

91
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
China

92
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
Google assistant is really

93
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
You could say the

94
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
The maturity and

95
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,383
Combination of the old Google Now and Google on tap

96
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:38,015
And it's now built into home and you can speak into it just like Alexa and

97
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
I did that too

98
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
And you can speak

99
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,463
And you can speak to it like you can with an Amazon Echo and it will respond

100
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,351
I'm so it has a lot of similar capabilities and ecosystem which for Android folks

101
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,143
That's a good thing I think

102
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:59,775
But what it doesn't have at least at launch is enough partners for me to actually purchase it

103
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,335
And that's because it's limited

104
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,663
Two working with Samsung SmartThings

105
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
If this then that

106
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,271
Nest obviously and Philips Hue

107
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,855
So what's missing for me personally is Winx

108
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
You love your wink

109
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,535
Now I feel and in this is something I haven't had a chance to report out cuz I was on a plane

110
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,607
I feel that in the next couple of weeks

111
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
6

112
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
We're going to see a lot of

113
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
New partners com

114
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,775
That's that is my hunch

115
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,591
Because I know that I talk to people in the smartphone

116
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
Community and they are

117
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,455
Eager to get involved here so I think this might be kind of a

118
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
I don't know if it was a rushed kind of lunch

119
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
But I do think

120
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,415
Keeping things under wrap and also

121
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
Which they did not do

122
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
Clearly this was not ready for a launch in May when it was introduced and that's

123
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,191
Obviously it didn't watch

124
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
It happened now

125
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
You would think that

126
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,127
The product team behind you go home with working to integrate partners and

127
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
Those potential Partners had it

128
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,455
Information to make that happen

129
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,063
Maybe there was some early lunch deals like a would mean you can be our top three

130
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
First Partners in Seoul

131
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
I don't know

132
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
I think you're right I think

133
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,743
Google lies heavily on partnership in an open platform

134
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
It says here you're the product go do with it what you will

135
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,399
So you're right I would think within the next few months we should see

136
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
More announcements from partners

137
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
My Hope

138
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
No

139
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
There was some discussion

140
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,823
About if you worked with Amazon Echo that you

141
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
You wouldn't be worth

142
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
With Google

143
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,687
There were reports of that some exclusivity stuff

144
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:49,087
But I haven't read anything official on that I haven't seen any Partners comment on that

145
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,903
It doesn't make SmartThings works with the echo

146
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,975
Philips Hue works with Echo and homekit

147
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
I'm trying to think

148
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
If this then that works with that buddy

149
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,167
Yeah so that kind of proves the fact that it's probably not exclusivity thing

150
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
So so that's good

151
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
Now

152
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
Now

153
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
So you're not buying

154
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Cuz you want wink support

155
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,871
Yet yet

156
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Sorry

157
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
And I would say so

158
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,711
Wait we mention the partners

159
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,039
I would like to see and I think the smart home Community would like to see

160
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
Wink support

161
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,975
I know that I talk to the CEO of August Jason Johnson and he's looking at supporting this because any voice activation

162
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
That's really key

163
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
For their products

164
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:34,399
And then I'd also like to see the Logitech Harmony home hub because a lot of people seem to have that in like

165
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,215
That is actually really

166
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,775
Good thing to integrate with us because you can be like

167
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,383
Google Assistant turn on my Netflix

168
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
Why not

169
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,831
Although that I was just going to say that actually can be done with the Chromecast

170
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,415
Because Google home does speak to Chromecast if you have one in the house

171
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,743
And Googled it announced a new 4k Chromecast yesterday as well

172
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,791
Apps that you can say

173
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
At least at launch

174
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,655
You can say play this video on Youtube it'll

175
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,471
Put on your TV voice control the TV

176
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,055
Netflix was announced as a early first partner's well it's not

177
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
There yet but they did demonstrate

178
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,175
Hey show me whatever movie on Netflix and Hulu

179
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
Thanks

180
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,759
Stranger things which is very good by the way

181
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:26,111
You do get voice control of a TV and it's one of the things that I've always felt as lacking width

182
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
My echo and Fire TV box

183
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Guess they don't talk to each other

184
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,487
And that that is silly

185
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
I'm not sure Amazon's getting on the

186
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
I'm at right now

187
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
The other thing

188
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,399
Because

189
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Google watch this

190
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
Nuding is

191
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,543
That you can actually Chromecast

192
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
To other speakers

193
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,175
With auxiliary power so if you have a Chromecast audio

194
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,527
And I think those are like $35 for a Chromecast audio

195
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,343
If you plug that into like the back of one of your Sonos

196
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Place or something

197
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
Like that then you can

198
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Can Chromecast

199
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
To that Sonos

200
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
Talking to it via app

201
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
Sorry talking to it via

202
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
Google Assistant

203
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:14,239
Right so that gets really interesting and I should also know that the Google home also comes with support for tuna in pan

204
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
Pandora Spotify

205
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
In a couple other

206
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,687
Services very similar services and it also let you set a default most likely

207
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Rail

208
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,063
For the music folks this could be a really exciting

209
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,391
Dang if you have like a bunch of Sonos is lying around and you don't want to wait

210
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
2017

211
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
With the Echoes go

212
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Look at that support

213
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,023
Yep make sense

214
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
So

215
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
That is all that

216
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
That is all there I bought mine

217
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
Until you guys

218
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
At the second I would wrap that thing

219
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,031
We're getting on the show and recording something

220
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
Maybe we'll do a back and forth in

221
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,895
I will owe the other thing I was going to say is

222
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,175
It sounds like

223
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,479
They have different voices

224
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
Great Lake

225
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
These must have been recorded demos because

226
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
The voice quality did not sound

227
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Great

228
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
The Google Device

229
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,255
And I was a little saddened by that because it sounded kind of like

230
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,583
The Google voice thing was at the bottom of a well

231
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:18,239
Yeah I don't know when they put together the demo videos and and whatnot I do know that

232
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
Sundar pichai a talk about how Google does

233
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:25,663
Natural language processing and Records tons and tons and tons of phrases inside chin

234
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:32,575
I didn't get the demo anything I actually had my hands on a pixel phone and in New York City yesterday but I did not try Google assistant on

235
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
I didn't have a chance to us

236
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
I can't really

237
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,951
Can't say either way I guess we have to wait and see you for the final product

238
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,535
Yeah and I'm outside looking forward to a couple things I'm looking forward

239
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
2

240
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
A better Interactive

241
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
Back and forth

242
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
Things to Google Assistant

243
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
I'm also looking

244
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,775
Poor Dad in the power of Google search on the device as opposed to Bing

245
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
Is there times when I'm like

246
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,895
I just want to say you know she who shall not be named

247
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,455
What's a spice that goes well with asparagus

248
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
And if I ask

249
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
I get an answer

250
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
If I asked

251
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,391
And then that speaks again to

252
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
Sunrise presentation were

253
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
Pretty sure a December he said something like

254
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
Dundee

255
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,095
Machine learning aspect heading out of the knowledge graph now has

256
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
70s

257
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,423
Billion + 70 billion

258
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,007
It knows 70 billion people places things cutting out

259
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:28,127
Especially saying Hey Google we have all the information and we're making it available to you in a

260
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,431
Easy way to access

261
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,735
Ed and you actually mention something

262
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
Else I don't know if we

263
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
Specifically said

264
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
You said you were

265
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,391
Jersey or you were looking forward to interacting with it

266
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
Because it's contextual

267
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,023
You can can carry on a conversation

268
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,607
And you don't need to repeat certain keywords so to speak so

269
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,911
You say who is the

270
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
Who wrote stranger things

271
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,007
And then you later say what is his birthday

272
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,103
You don't have to mention him by name so there's that aspect which I think some of the

273
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,687
AI bits like an Siri and the echo kind of fall short

274
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,063
I knew you were going to know that isn't that crazy

275
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,855
Example

276
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,391
See you just handed me the ball

277
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,231
I know it's not on the show notes folk she recalled that from memory

278
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
From Henry

279
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
Useless things I know

280
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
Oh that useless

281
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Okay so

282
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,399
We should also talk about Google Wi-Fi

283
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,959
Because in addition to home

284
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
And

285
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,055
Some people were hoping that Google home and the wife I would be like

286
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,151
But you know I was when I was one of those people

287
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,991
I hoped that it would be you know kind of a

288
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Voice assistant

289
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
And Mesh networking router thing but it's

290
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Just a mess

291
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
Networking router thing just a mesh Network

292
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,279
Jobs that make you go we would be like

293
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
You know I want one of these

294
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,935
Very badly because I have an onhub and

295
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,311
There are a few areas in my house where my wife is not that great we could really use a mesh Network

296
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,639
But I don't know even though I tested the Euros

297
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
Which were great

298
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,503
I don't know that I want to spend like $5 for a set of euros

299
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Now

300
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
And not all you can spend

301
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:21,791
It's 129 for a single pack of Google Wi-Fi so one edition

302
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
And it's

303
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
299 free

304
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
3 pack

305
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,935
So that's a big price difference

306
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
They will be available for pre-order

307
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
In the US in November

308
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
And they will also be sold at

309
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,871
Amazon Best Buy

310
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
Walmart

311
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,943
That's weird cuz Amazon doesn't sell

312
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
Amazon doesn't sell Chromecast but

313
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
That's different

314
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,623
That's so here's a question for you and see if you know the answer to this one

315
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
Smarty pants

316
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
Why are they selling a

317
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Single pack

318
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
Network extender

319
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
What would it work with

320
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,863
Well it's not just a network extender you can

321
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
Habitat is your router

322
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,215
I believe so

323
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
It can messaging wasn't

324
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,055
Next to your land

325
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,687
I believe it maybe they're selling a single pack if it's not an actual router

326
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
To work with you

327
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,551
Bingo

328
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
It was something I had hoped

329
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
That I would hear about

330
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,951
On stage with the product they didn't mention it however

331
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
Being happy on HUB owner

332
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:29,119
I went and checked the onhub support Pages which were updated to show that

333
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,935
You can add a Google wifi device

334
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
To an onhub

335
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:38,591
Why that wasn't discussed I don't know why cuz it was like they killed the onhub that's I mean I saw

336
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,639
25 comments immediately

337
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Nope

338
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
If this is an in addition to

339
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,759
They also other the on HUB has it

340
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,599
This device for smart home people you're going to like this it has a Bluetooth radio

341
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,999
So you got Wi-Fi + Bluetooth radio which means all of those tiny little doorbell chimes or

342
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
Lock Bridges or anything

343
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
That has a Bluetooth radio in it

344
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,423
Will eventually be able to be supported by the

345
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Google Wi-Fi

346
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,287
So that's exciting for people who don't want

347
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
How to plug in a bunch of

348
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
Yay

349
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,919
And we're going to see that in a lot of routers that's not

350
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,711
Going to be specific to this but like

351
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:20,063
If you're buying a new router anytime in the near future in your vested in the Smart Home

352
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,367
I would look at like securifi

353
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,951
This one I think the Netflix orbi might be Bluetooth ready to

354
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,255
I'm so start looking for

355
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,559
Bluetooth is part of your router

356
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,375
I'm a double check on the orbi because you

357
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
It's always worthwhile to say

358
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
Hello

359
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
I'm not seeing

360
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
Not simply

361
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Dyson

362
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:49,759
Putting Bluetooth in router doesn't make sense in the morning get rid of hubs so to speak and I'm all for it number one and I shall sacrifice

363
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
You are absolutely right this is a router by itself

364
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
It is so cute you were right

365
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
I love it

366
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
This happens so rarely

367
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Okay

368
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
EXO

369
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
That is

370
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
The Riders Inn

371
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,911
Guys I'm going to tell you so I am actually reporting out a story on

372
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
The right router for your smart home

373
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
Which could be like

374
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,311
Holy Grail Quest because

375
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
It may never be complete

376
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
I don't know if that's really

377
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
Who's there

378
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,247
But I'm hearing a lot of mixed reports from

379
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
People about

380
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,879
You know if there's too many devices in a lot of these mesh networks it becomes

381
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
Really congested

382
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:33,279
I know that there are things about like how Apple sends data around a home network that is

383
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
Makes it really hard for

384
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
People with mesh Networks

385
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
An Apple devices

386
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,471
This is not me saying that mesh networks are bad it's just

387
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,263
There seems to be

388
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,079
3 by 4 kitted user experience

389
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,919
And it seems to be related to the number of Gadgets in the types of gadgets you haven't

390
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,247
So in my quest to help our listeners

391
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
I'm looking into all this for

392
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,831
I'll let you know what I find

393
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,647
It does require me to purchase a crazy expensive

394
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
Spectrum analyzer so I'm hoping the

395
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
That I can just get that

396
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
Borrowed for a little while

397
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:10,911
Yes it would be the texas-based to FCC Testing Lab

398
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:17,567
Let's see next story are we done with Google do we feel like we have sufficiently discuss Google

399
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,199
I think we have like I said when I can talk about the phones those were the two those are the two i o t a

400
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,503
Types of things to talk about the end

401
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,111
It's all we can do is talk about them now since we can't actually get the products in hand just yet so I think so

402
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:34,463
There we go anything Google can do to expedite my shipment I am all on it

403
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
Ready to test

404
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
We'll see what happens

405
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,839
Alright so the next big story

406
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
Actually let's do a quick update

407
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Because last week

408
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
Talk about your Apple to Hawaii

409
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:49,823
Watch all the Apple watch 3 that's right I did real quick say I was going to run a half marathon and test the battery life so

410
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,151
I ran an hour 50 and I had Bluetooth

411
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
Free music

412
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,223
Heart rate monitor and GPS

413
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:02,623
Battery went down 43% so with all the radios and sensors on I'm thinking it's at least a four hour

414
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,671
Device for you exercise feedings

415
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
Everybody else

416
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,231
Exercising

417
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Get up and move number one

418
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,631
Your wash it easily last a day mine always last more than a day so

419
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,495
Got it you know a Dancing with the Stars they practice they do for our practices isn't that insane

420
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
Like exercise

421
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,383
Sorry I I learned this fact and I was like

422
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
Holy Jim

423
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,991
Calories being burned

424
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Yeah. One of those people I lose

425
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,063
Okay so

426
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,367
Let's move right along to iot botnet

427
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,023
We can talk about this attack last

428
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,815
But now there's more information

429
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,887
There is and it's worth saying because I didn't

430
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,935
But when we recorded last week.

431
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Yet to do

432
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,031
My interviews that are structured at the

433
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:57,407
I have yet to do the interviews at the structure security conference with a bunch of people about iot and security

434
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,735
So I learned a lot of new things that I thought was worth sharing

435
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
So

436
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
To refresh

437
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,367
Deer are too big

438
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
Botnets

439
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
It were

440
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,951
Unleashed upon the world

441
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,791
That relieves it that got up to about 6 between 600 in

442
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:18,399
Whatever they sent they they measured it like 1.5 terabits per second

443
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
Which is a lot

444
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Atrophic

445
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
So what was happening is

446
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,127
Originally Brian Krebs was forced offline Brian Krebs as a security researcher

447
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,479
Because of this botnet attack that reached between 600 and 700

448
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
Gigabits

449
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Per second

450
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
So

451
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,367
Massive Attack one of the largest we've ever seen

452
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
And

453
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,719
There was another against it is pee called ovh

454
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
And that was

455
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Bigger

456
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
So

457
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,839
These were made of

458
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,423
Iot devices so I was like oh my God this is

459
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
Terrible

460
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,567
And they were actually made of networked DVRs which is not a tradition this isn't like your refrig

461
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,615
Auto Repair happened fridges that are par

462
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Certified Nets

463
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
This is

464
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,967
These closed-circuit video cameras that

465
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,759
Small businesses deploy

466
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:11,391
And then they later connect them to the Internet so they can be like I can watch someone robbed my store

467
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
For the comfort of my own

468
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
Orlo the Fire HD

469
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
In HD

470
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:21,631
So what's happening is people are taking over these devices because people don't update them

471
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,935
They're not really designed to be always connect

472
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
So

473
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,263
People are concerned

474
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:34,175
The flipside to our privacy worries and security where is on the internet of things that we always talk about white people hacking into your baby

475
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
Monitors

476
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
Is

477
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,503
The people are actually

478
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,855
Turning all of these devices into botnets and using your home's bandwidth

479
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
2

480
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:47,743
Watch these crazy massive attacks it because there's so many devices and their into many homes

481
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:53,119
It's less a function of so many it's more a function of their spread out and that they're not updated

482
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
They can be used for

483
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,471
4 years on these crazy attack

484
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
Because nobody's like

485
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,335
I'm like a computer slowing down you don't notice when your DVR is like

486
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
Siphoning off bandwidth

487
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:09,759
Their there they're not devices that you would be paying this kind of attention to and then she said they're very distributed

488
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Now what

489
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,343
Really interesting what I learned at the structure security

490
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
Conference is there's like

491
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,184
Two to three groups that are actually

492
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,024
Organizing and controlling these botnets and what's happening is

493
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
As they fight each other

494
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
They're going out

495
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
And patching

496
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
The devices for

497
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,216
Are people so their enemies can't use it

498
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
I like you

499
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
Thanks but also

500
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
This feels

501
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
This feels scary

502
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
Little out of control

503
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Light outage

504
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
So

505
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,016
And that brings us to our

506
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,296
Next story

507
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,344
Segway

508
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
Be way more effective

509
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,512
The Segway has released this week Shirley Tuesday

510
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
A

511
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
Checklist

512
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,400
On enhancing the security privacy and safety of

513
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,936
Connected devices

514
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,776
This is a great tracklist and this is brought To Us by the same group

515
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,104
That they had last year worked with the

516
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,896
National Association of Realtors

517
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,432
To do a smart home

518
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,480
Like decommissioning checklist that was

519
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
Really helpful

520
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:22,208
New checklist which I will link to in the show note so you all can download it

521
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
A lot of its common sense

522
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,048
It has things like you don't

523
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,632
Know all the devices with your home and workplace that are connected to the internet

524
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,240
I'm just able to unload it on use devices

525
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
I have a pet peeve here though

526
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,824
This is a great thing to do I try to do it

527
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,128
But even things like my Eero

528
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,944
Or even when I had software that measured my devices

529
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,480
Imagine that based on

530
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,576
You're all those aren't always

531
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
Telling you what they are

532
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,416
Yeah that's that's tricky

533
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:56,512
You're not trying to plug the product because if I work for it's just a product that I used

534
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
With the onhub

535
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:03,936
You can actually name devices and you have a better sense of what they are like like to suck hell out of them self identify which

536
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,520
I do see some mac addresses in the list of devices but

537
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,312
They are far and few between

538
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
So

539
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:16,224
So yeah my time I'm looking at my Eros right now to see what I can see on the network

540
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
Take a minute

541
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,296
When I

542
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
Like some of them are great

543
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,136
But then a lot of them are named after like

544
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,416
Bishop's like summer like

545
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,952
Crazy number Nest Labs Inc

546
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,512
Sound like okay I only have one Nest devices

547
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
My house

548
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,352
I have brother Industries

549
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,448
Amazon actually did add their name to sir

550
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
So used to be

551
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
Medeco had just a random

552
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,080
Mac address but now it says Amazon Tech

553
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
Technologies Inc

554
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,968
My Fire TV is all have a specific name and whatnot yeah

555
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
But like

556
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,040
I got it so the ring doorbell is good

557
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,576
My Sonos has are all good

558
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
But I have all these ampact

559
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Technology

560
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,184
I don't know what impact

561
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
Technology Inc

562
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
What

563
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,888
Craig's iPhone is on mine

564
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,728
That's my father-in-law who the heck is Greg

565
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,288
That actually isn't that the other thing here

566
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
A lot of these

567
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,152
You know easily viewable router table so to speak

568
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
Are showing

569
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,224
Previously connected devices

570
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,784
Just wish me no longer be in the house

571
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,344
You know mine's divided up on currently connected

572
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
So I feel better about that but

573
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,232
Yes just for a minute there I was like

574
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
Craigslist

575
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,792
Okay

576
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
We've only got through the first

577
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,888
The next piece of advice

578
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,496
It's to contact your ISP to update routers and modems to the latest security stand

579
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:47,104
Change your router service I didn't know that's what is SSID stand for

580
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,152
Router service set identifier

581
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,712
I mean I know what my SSID is I just did

582
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,808
I said change it to something that does not identify you your family or the device

583
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,856
That makes sense

584
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:02,208
Check out contact information for all of your devices and make sure they're up to date with

585
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
With your current email

586
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
Melidress

587
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,608
Confirm that all of your devices are able set for automatic updating

588
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,936
And make sure you're getting the latest firmware patches

589
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,240
You can do all your passwords

590
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,520
And where possible

591
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,568
Implement multi-factor Authentication

592
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
I

593
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
I'm not going to do that

594
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
That problem

595
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,712
It's a lot of work

596
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
That's tough but a lot of these

597
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
Stats are the thing is

598
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,344
We need to be doing a better job at

599
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:33,184
Yeso in this is a smart one although exhausting in a possible

600
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,744
Review the Privacy policies and practices of your

601
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,352
Your devices because it is your settings can be inadvertently change during update

602
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
Spotify

603
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
Drove me nuts

604
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,216
Reverting everything to publican

605
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,520
Because my daughter listens to all this stuff

606
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,872
I really need everybody to know that I am listening to Katy Perry Non-Stop

607
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
Can we do now

608
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
Yes well it's my daughter

609
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,784
But yes that

610
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
Sure

611
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
And then

612
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,416
Yuan clearing data off if you return it or sell it

613
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,208
That actually got people in trouble with

614
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
Security camera

615
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
The Arlo's actually

616
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,376
Review your location tracking

617
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,144
In the back of your phone

618
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
So these are pretty obvious

619
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
What agency on here

620
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,312
Was change your router passwords

621
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,384
And make sure you got a password on your router

622
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,944
Yeah I mean

623
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,272
We might they may think that's a given but no added a lot of people just

624
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:34,880
Just take the default if you know a my network name is Linksys password

625
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,440
Alright let's go where am I

626
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
And that's not good

627
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
Work that's not going to lie

628
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
No

629
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,120
That's that's kind of not my house that doesn't fly

630
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,448
Presidents

631
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,728
All right

632
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
So let's see

633
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
Kabul news briefs

634
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,640
That's so that's the OT a survey that's how you secure your smart home a little bit

635
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
I mean again

636
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,968
Some of these devices just are not

637
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,760
Really securable in that is sad

638
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
That is sad

639
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:07,904
We're getting there though I do feel that the industry is at least much more aware of this and is like

640
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,720
Oh crikey we really got to support this

641
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
I also would say

642
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,816
You know if you're going to invest in a lot of devices

643
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
I should tell you guys that

644
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,960
I want to do this in a couple weeks when I find the time and my husband lets me shut down our Network

645
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,056
But I'm actually going to go super extreme and create a separate Network

646
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,104
For my iot devices

647
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,176
And I'm going to try to set up a firewall

648
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
Behind them

649
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:35,552
And I got this idea from Andy Ellis who is the CTO of a Takamine

650
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,600
We're talking about security stuff

651
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,904
And so he and I are actually he's like this is why

652
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
What you should do as I like to you

653
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,256
So we're going to figure out we're going to figure it out

654
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,024
Together

655
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,376
So it's possible we won't have a podcast for a couple of weeks cuz I will look

656
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
Totally broken my neck

657
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,192
Ono.

658
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Hopefully that does

659
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,032
I mean I might totally

660
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:03,456
So this is my grand plan when I implement it I plan on writing like a detailed how to pose for anyone who's crazy enough

661
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
What you want to do this

662
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,040
And you know guys feel free to send me stuff

663
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
Set questions at iot

664
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
Podcast.com

665
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
If you have suggestions

666
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
I know it's not a question

667
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
But send it anyway

668
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
All right

669
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,000
News briefs

670
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,072
Some real fast stuff is happening that you might buy to be aware of

671
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,864
Let's start with

672
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,192
I do not okay

673
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
I feel like I've been talking a lot

674
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Let's start with

675
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
Let Echo

676
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Flacco

677
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,688
These guys made actually think the first phone using the Qualcomm 8

678
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
20 chip

679
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,248
Nothing 21 that's in the pixel

680
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,552
But and they also bought Vizio

681
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,880
They are launching an iot division here in the United States

682
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,928
And they hired rachna.

683
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,232
Who used to be at Qualcomm and

684
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,024
Doing all the All Join stuff

685
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,352
And then moved over to a start-up called helium

686
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,472
He's in charge of this so I'm really interested in like another brand

687
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,496
Coming over with some

688
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:04,384
He is an exceptionally smart guy and a good could hire Facebook's I love Rob

689
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
Yes

690
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
Good endorsement

691
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,248
Other news looks like

692
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,016
And those are the

693
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
The only

694
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:17,184
Maker sometimes it feels that way and Intel are doing smart glasses smart

695
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,024
Eyeglasses that you know will check your stats track all kinds of crazy stuff

696
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,328
I feel like step trackers again

697
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
They are there already

698
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,168
They already are

699
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,984
Blink which makes these tiny $100

700
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:34,848
HD Wi-Fi cameras they integrated with the Amazon Echo so now you can tell

701
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,128
She who shall not be named

702
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,968
To arm or disarm your blink security system

703
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
Yeah that's that's very handy

704
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,648
These guys that you can buy like a pack of five of these for like

705
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,440
330 bucks which is

706
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Crazy Cheap

707
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,792
On their battery power just they look like motion sensors basically

708
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
Set them up on a wall

709
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
They're real fun

710
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,192
I know somebody someone emailed me saying they used it as they like

711
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:04,032
Camera in their refrigerator so they could see like when the door opened it

712
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
Detect motion

713
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
Take picture

714
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,616
They can see what's in the fridge

715
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,944
Because it's battery powered you can do that yes

716
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
It's not going to

717
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,248
I don't know if it actually

718
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,040
There's two things there there's

719
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,600
Cold and the Faraday cage

720
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,624
They're happy with it

721
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
It's relative

722
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
That's cool

723
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
All right

724
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
So

725
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,792
That is it for this week show

726
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,072
Jetpack cell phone

727
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,888
And stay tuned for our guest

728
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:34,496
Who is a realtor in Miami Beach who's going to tell us what devices we should stock our smart home with

729
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,288
It's for the best resale value

730
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,064
And now for a word from our sponsor

731
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,368
This week sponsor is hpe

732
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,928
And talk about HPV

733
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,560
Dr. Tom bradach who is VP and general manager for servers in iot system

734
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:03,168
So we're here talking about the ability to deliver hybrid iot

735
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,448
And you mentioned to me that

736
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
With the Internet of Things

737
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,568
There are three physical places that you have to deal with it

738
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,360
Can you elaborate on that for me please

739
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,920
I like to refer to him as a trihybrid

740
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:14,944
Ikea

741
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,992
Because there are three places

742
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,296
The first two rather obvious it's either the

743
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,112
On-prem Data Center

744
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,672
Cloud and then the other off Graham that's emerge

745
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,744
And the edge has many dimension

746
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,072
Like with respect to this all your teeth as they are

747
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,888
As you know what I ain't asking for a

748
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
City tram

749
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,984
A smart building the wind farm in or regular

750
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
Energy grid

751
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,056
Dimension of the edge

752
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,896
That is not the iot is also very important for the other off crown

753
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,224
Domains of Telecom media CDN

754
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,016
Campuses in Branch offices

755
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,320
Are there free places now where I T

756
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,880
Is going to be a dominant technology

757
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,416
Xen support

758
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,256
Improvements as well as scientific discovery

759
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,792
Civil engineering games

760
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,864
Into the things that are out there

761
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,144
NY does

762
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:10,496
The notion of it emerging at the edges extremely important

763
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
Realized because

764
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,896
And in subsequent podcast

765
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,712
What's happening at the edge NYIT is so important there

766
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,248
Another reason

767
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,296
To keep the trihybrid approach

768
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,136
Someone does not want to be confined restricted

769
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,696
Sherlock you know that on Prime data center North

770
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:34,304
Child lock in door being forced to keep things remote when indeed it would be better

771
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
Managing better drops

772
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,144
Local and give you more control

773
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,960
So what is Hewlett-Packard Enterprise

774
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Have to offer

775
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,312
How many people know that hpe excels in

776
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,200
In the production of it equipment in the deployment of IHG

777
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,504
Robust cloud

778
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
As well

779
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,832
And the edge that's emerging the Third

780
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,624
Of the trihybrid

781
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,672
Applications of it

782
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:05,280
I work literally shifting out

783
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
In many areas

784
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,584
Altoona

785
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
So what we offer is

786
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:12,448
Ability for a customer to enjoy familiarity

787
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,728
Compatibility

788
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,288
Nez scalability it all free

789
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,104
The trihydrate locations in this hybrid

00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Pikachu

And today's guest is Danny hertzberg

796
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,400
Who is a realtor with

797
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,216
The chills in Miami Beach Florida

798
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,008
Hi Danny

799
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,312
Doing great thanks around me Stacy

800
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,360
Man I am so excited to have you

801
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,688
Both for selfish reasons and because I think this is going to be a fun show

802
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,016
You are here this week to talk about how to sell the smart

803
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,808
And since I have eight

804
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
Leicester

805
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,392
Devices in my house I have corset like who

806
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,440
What should I put in there was a goodbye

807
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,720
What was it

808
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,280
Let's just get started with a sense of

809
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,816
How do you when your

810
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,120
Putting a house on the market are looking at a listing

811
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,424
How do you define it a smart

812
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
House

813
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
Defining a smart home

814
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,776
It's a new you know a new term

815
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:24,384
And what we want to talk about typically is the connectivity of devices

816
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,664
The ease-of-use

817
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:29,504
A lot of consumers lot of the buyers they respond to brand names

818
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,064
So instead of saying you know we have

819
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624
Smart AC system we might say

820
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,928
Property is controlled by nest

821
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,072
And we instead of talking about smart locks we might say an actual brand name of August locks because

822
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,656
That's something that resonates with buyers and when they're looking at

823
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,240
Hundreds of homes and descriptions on Zillow Trulia realtor.com

824
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,264
Brand names

825
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
Smart technology

826
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,336
She stands out to them because they're looking at

827
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,128
You know the whole experience of the property

828
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,784
And if it's something that's going to benefit them in their daily lives it's going to track them to that property and maybe make that home Stand Out verses

829
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,808
The house down the street

830
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
Got it

831
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,624
So if I'm considering

832
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,440
Selling my house what brands are worth investing

833
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
Sure

834
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,512
So I work with a lot of investor

835
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Developers

836
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,120
And there are looking to maximize every dollar now that they put into the properties

837
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
So what if we tell them is

838
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,240
Yeah they have to be smart technology that

839
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,544
Benefits of experience in the daily lives

840
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,616
So the buyers because when I'm showing it it's one thing describing it

841
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,920
When I walk into a property with the buyers

842
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,968
They have to get excited about something

843
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,248
So one of the

844
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,320
Products that really stands out that tires are used

845
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,344
To sing in

846
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,672
You know high-end Homes apartments they're staying at it at

847
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
In office space

848
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
This is nest

849
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,048
It's known across most of the consumers they respond to it

850
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,840
Very simple to use and has a sexy

851
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
She look

852
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,912
So that's a brand that I think stands out lot of

853
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:55,008
They coming to the property it's very easy to show them to

854
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,824
Explain the benefits of that some of them don't understand

855
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,872
All the Smart Home Technology

856
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:04,736
But they surely can understand that in some homes you have to go up in every room and turn off the lights

857
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,320
And other homes you're going to press one button and all the lights are off when you leave

858
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,344
Not something that we

859
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
Stick out

860
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,904
From home to home and I think

861
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,208
Things like lighting HVAC

862
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Smart Lock

863
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,280
That goes above and beyond the value of the

864
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
The investment

865
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,352
Okay so Nest smart lighting

866
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,680
Yeah like Lutron August locks

867
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,216
I mean those are those are kind of

868
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,496
Big names

869
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,800
In the in a smart space released from

870
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
Higher perspective

871
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,128
Okay do you get a lot of

872
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,200
Questions about how these things will work I'm just thinking

873
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:39,040
Not necessarily in a new house but if I were to sell my house for example

874
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,368
Conveying some of the stuff to the new buyer would be

875
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,440
Kind of complicated I don't know if it's a turnoff or not

876
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
Yeah I think it's

877
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,768
It is complicated but I think it's it's

878
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,792
It's important that

879
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:54,912
Whoever selling the property whether it's the owner themselves or likely real estate agent that agent

880
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,448
Understand Ted Hughes

881
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,008
The system and understands how to explain the benefits of the

882
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,800
So that's a big

883
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,824
Component of it

884
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,848
After walking

885
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,896
Through I mean I've been on showings where

886
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
The other agent

887
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,224
The property has a very complex system

888
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
Where how to use it

889
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,808
And they're not it's not working

890
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,392
And it doesn't you know they can't turn the lights on they can't turn the music on they candy

891
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
He's a Smart Lock

892
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,952
Versus another experience

893
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,000
Or somebody's walking them through showing them how to use

894
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,072
Components why they like it while they have it in their own home

895
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,632
Tell me the story of daily life like once

896
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,656
To be nicer

897
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,496
It's so great that I don't have to carry cheese anymore and they open up a lock

898
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,264
Phone

899
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
That resonates

900
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:37,664
And that really makes a difference in most markets across the country their competitive markets

901
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
And how do you stand out

902
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:44,064
Some homes are in a brand new kitchens and bathrooms but if all the homes are doing bad

903
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
This is the next step

904
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
The only thing that's interesting is

905
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,928
Byers at this point

906
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,488
If a home is brand new or fully renovated

907
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,840
And somebody didn't put in a smart system they look at it as almost as you cut corners

908
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,144
Okay and do you have a sense of

909
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,680
What that can add to the

910
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,728
The price of the house in terms of

911
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,776
Sales price or how quickly it moves

912
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:11,200
It's very hard to tell because you don't know two homes are like right and even if we had two identical properties they would be they were

913
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,224
I want to be on the same parcel

914
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
What's the location to driver

915
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,576
But I do get the sense over all that

916
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,136
Similar price point similar square footage

917
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
It's a standout

918
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:20,928
Feature

919
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:26,304
It's also standout feature if the home had you know a brand new kitchen or standout feature if it had

920
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,096
Brand new pool at those kind of things

921
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,168
It's right off of you it's it's an aspect selling aspect

922
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,728
I think Home2Home I've seen buyers

923
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
Lean towards one proper

924
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,080
There's a perceived value above

925
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,616
With it installed system

926
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,152
Above and beyond the cost

927
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
If you think about it

928
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
If a buyer

929
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,968
What's a home on the market

930
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
Is a million dollars

931
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
They realize

932
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
Pools going to cost

933
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,552
50000

934
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,880
It would probably pay above and beyond the cost of the pool because

935
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,184
Pulling permits if I knew the contract

936
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,768
The same is true with the Smart Home Technology buyers want to come in

937
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,072
And have a turnkey home bring your toothbrush

938
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,096
That really related

939
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,632
Smart Home Technology also

940
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
Got it what happens

941
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:08,032
If I'm listing my house and I've got a crust on or insteon system in there

942
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,568
Are you going to tell me

943
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
Stacy

944
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,384
Back office

945
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,200
Try some of these other things or is that still cool

946
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,832
It's so cool I mean people still appreciate the control for the Crestron

947
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
They like them

948
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,416
I don't know if you'll get the full value

949
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,208
So if you already had it

950
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,488
Greatest benefit

951
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,536
But it's okay if somebody came to me

952
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,096
Unless it's at their very very very high-end

953
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,656
You define with different you know

954
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,680
Components smart

955
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,984
Components of a work with each other and maybe

956
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,592
The home has an Amazon Echo and there you know that's kind of the Hub rather than have York restaurants

957
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
System hop

958
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,408
You cannot take my Amazon Echo Dot

959
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
Does not convey

960
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,480
I have taken that guy with me

961
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
It stays

962
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:55,136
Redcoats

963
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,464
Yeah I think that I think that you'll see

964
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,024
Maybe at a very very high empress

965
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,096
Price point you'll still see some of that the Crestron savant

966
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
Metro Ford

967
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,912
The pretty much across

968
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,960
The Country Inn condos single family

969
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,544
You're going to see how the different components because the price point like

970
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:18,688
I can't justify to a client building a million-dollar to million reason $3000000 spec home

971
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,992
To put in a 30 or $40,000

972
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,528
I can justify putting in

973
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,088
1520 $500

974
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,136
System that pretty much for most

975
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
Consumers

976
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,952
Accomplishes the same thing

977
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
It's true

978
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
I

979
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:35,072
And now I actually ripping and replacing old Smart Home Technology

980
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
New stuff

981
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,632
Which

982
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,168
I feel really hard

983
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,472
But I'm going to get over it

984
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Eventually

985
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
Evolving

986
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:47,104
What price point does this become like a must have

987
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,688
And I know this differs based on different markets but

988
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
Can I get a sensor

989
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,504
What do I need to have this

990
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,576
I think the science is whatever the market is

991
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,112
Wherever the perception

992
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,648
The luxury price

993
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
So in a lot of markets

994
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,976
You know what's a million.

995
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,280
And some and some markets 500000

996
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,304
Luxury price point

997
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,072
Yashow market

998
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,656
Miami Beach might be 2 to 3 million price point

999
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,192
Or LA or New York

1000
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,264
So I think it's out entry-luxury price point

1001
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
But there's a huge benefit

1002
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,336
To even at you know

1003
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
300000

1004
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,152
$200,000

1005
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:25,760
Property mean you're seeing at the home builders that are building tract homes all over the country

1006
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
They're putting in

1007
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,808
Lot of bass

1008
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,344
Smart Home Technology because

1009
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,136
People appreciate it they can

1010
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,160
Buy it

1011
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,184
Probably put in fist

1012
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,232
It's $4,000 a house and

1013
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,024
It sells faster and

1014
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,352
It goes above and beyond the value of the investment that ski

1015
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,656
You don't see that in a lot of other things in a home where

1016
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,984
You know I can say you know it's hard to show

1017
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,008
It's just

1018
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,544
Experience-based evidence

1019
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,384
But I think most builders that do it once they continue to do and that says a lot

1020
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,783
It'll most of my clients are a little bit like hesitant maybe when they're like what's the point of the smart locked I really need smart HVAC

1021
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,343
And I get them to do it one time

1022
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,183
They do it every single their project after that cuz they see how people respond to it

1023
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
Awesome

1024
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,743
Does it has this change your job

1025
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
I think the changes

1026
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,095
Is there's a lot of educating but I've been doing

1027
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143
Educating my sellers wife

1028
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
Important it's

1029
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:19,263
Educating the developers investors why they should do it and a lot of its educating the

1030
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,103
The consumers so the buyers come in and they don't always understand

1031
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
The system what's

1032
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,663
The benefit so I've got to

1033
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,247
Explain it to them in a way that impacts that

1034
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,295
Somebody might not care about the fact that

1035
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,855
You know you have a smart HVAC it means nothing to them

1036
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,159
Am I really respond to this morning

1037
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
Entertainment System

1038
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:41,535
That's Chase my job a lot I mean we're always educating about the marking about the home but

1039
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,863
The technology education and you know

1040
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,423
34 in my industry and relatively Young

1041
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
So I'm

1042
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,263
And educating a lot of agents that work with that are in the 50s

1043
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,311
67 days and it's not always engaged

1044
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,359
Are some very tech-savvy agents

1045
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,919
On the older the higher end of the A train

1046
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,967
But once they try it

1047
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,271
And they they feel in the touching the user

1048
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,831
Yeah that they're hooked on and they loved it as well

1049
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
I'm very curious about

1050
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,927
The issue of longevity

1051
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,767
And driving standards because some of the stuff it feels like

1052
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,583
Like actually a good examples homekit

1053
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:20,191
Kind of has been hovering at the edges and now seems to be really entering the market

1054
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,215
Bright

1055
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,007
Or the drama over at nest

1056
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:29,663
What are you tell clients when they're like weight does this work with that do I want to invest in this forces

1057
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:36,063
The other yeah it's hard I mean I can only share like my own personal experience with people what I would have used it

1058
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,111
Different clients homes everyday

1059
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:41,439
In the system's I'm using their what I've use personally

1060
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
You know

1061
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511
There's different tribes with different things

1062
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
It's very hard

1063
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,375
It's hard to tell people what's good and also their price point also their budget

1064
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,703
So you know I'm not in the business of selling

1065
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,751
Smart home technology or the products

1066
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,567
But I am in the business of selling homes

1067
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,359
And I think that just like

1068
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:04,479
You a lot of real estate agents understand different types of wood flooring and they know about

1069
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,807
Different types of fixtures and they understand

1070
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,647
No types of construction this is one of those components that

1071
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,511
I think it's here to stay I don't I don't think it's a trend I think it's going to continue to grow

1072
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,535
All right

1073
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,839
And then what would you say to the industry

1074
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:24,191
Like you're trying to sell and talk to people who may not know about this stuff

1075
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
Everyday

1076
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
Whitewright what can you tell them

1077
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,055
The ease-of-use is critical

1078
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,359
One thing that frustrates me about

1079
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,663
Even some of the Smart Home Products I love

1080
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
That

1081
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,223
Although everybody

1082
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,807
You know they're smart company so they want everything to be kind of

1083
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,599
Digital app

1084
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,623
Yo

1085
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,927
Q&A but they still need to have

1086
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,231
Some of the old school personal touches Witcher

1087
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,023
If somebody has a major problem

1088
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,303
Tele telephone number

1089
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
And try to find

1090
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,631
Contact number on the most

1091
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
The smart products

1092
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,215
They Don't Really typically want to speak with

1093
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,263
You said that's something I could tell the industry that

1094
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:03,615
You know it's somebody's frustrated trying to get into their home cuz they're locked.

1095
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,431
They're not using their Smart Lock correctly

1096
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,967
Are you having trouble with

1097
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,015
You know they're nasty whatever product it is that

1098
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,807
Luckily they don't come up often

1099
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,367
Is there one way products but when they do I think that

1100
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
Personal component

1101
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,975
Even though they're not direct sales direct-to-consumer

1102
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:25,375
You have to have that aspect for a lot of people because it goes a long way and end and I I do commend in the street though because

1103
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,143
Does it seem

1104
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:29,215
With a lot of products I think I just saw with Nest that

1105
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,775
They have like if you don't feel like you can

1106
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Put in the product

1107
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,591
Yourself here's a designated Personnel coming

1108
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
Installed for you

1109
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,687
I think that's a really nice easy way to transition to

1110
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,479
Yourself

1111
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,295
Some people don't have the time or they don't have that

1112
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,063
You know

1113
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,415
Way that they're able to do that even if it's simple screwing in changing wires

1114
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:52,511
It's nice to make it easy and approachable for everybody so it's

1115
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:56,607
Keeping the email to human touch with helping people get onto the smart products

1116
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:00,447
Yeah well the stakes can be incredibly High when you're installing a new thermostat

1117
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,823
Absolutely I only take the hottest or coldest days of the year

1118
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,639
Just because I like the extra

1119
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,687
Okay and you

1120
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,735
Live in a somewhat smart

1121
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,527
What are the gadgets that you

1122
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:20,671
So am I home I guess I'll go from the entrance I have I just moved it to home

1123
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,999
So this is little by little but so far I'm using a

1124
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,535
I use August locks

1125
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,095
Smart locks that do not carry Keys anymore

1126
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,399
Has been phenomenal been able to let in

1127
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:35,263
Real friends when I need to if I don't get locked out or not to carry Keys anymore

1128
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,079
So the August locks are you have nests

1129
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,871
For all my thermostat

1130
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,711
Smoke alarms I use Mass I'd love the look like

1131
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,735
The glowing light

1132
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,271
A little ring at night

1133
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,807
77 NightLight if you walked

1134
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
The bathroom

1135
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,903
What else we have Amazon Echo

1136
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,671
Which is great

1137
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:59,327
Getting used to speaking to it a recognizing me but I think they're like Central Hub voice activation

1138
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,631
It's like the future of smart home technology

1139
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,703
And just not having to

1140
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,287
Reach for your phone and open the app just to be able to speak commands

1141
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,079
They're really nice aspect and

1142
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,871
And that's where we are so far

1143
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,663
I had a I was in an apartment

1144
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,431
Before that

1145
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,503
I fixed off and putting a lot of smart home

1146
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,527
Products and

1147
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,063
End up selling it in

1148
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,879
Recently got married and moved to a house so we're doing

1149
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:25,695
You know step by step as we go but so far in

1150
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,975
Naproxen and Grading

1151
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,535
And we're still waiting for dining room table and sum

1152
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,071
Other smart products that will see

1153
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,375
Dining room table going to be smart

1154
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:42,591
I don't think so not yet but I see some cool smart tables with the embedded you no touch screens and all things like that and

1155
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:46,687
We don't have a smart refrigerator yet cuz their refrigerator they was here

1156
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,967
Sky like a classic

1157
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:54,623
Old Sub-Zero now probably run forever but when I does Burnout I'm definitely getting one of the smart refrigerators where I can check my phone

1158
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
Inside of it

1159
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,999
And open up with you lifting up your foot and in all those great aspects

1160
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,535
Wow alright

1161
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,351
