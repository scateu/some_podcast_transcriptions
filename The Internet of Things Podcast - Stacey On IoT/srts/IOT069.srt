00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,080
Higginbotham and this is your co-host

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360

First Step we're going to have

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,504
Conversations about

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
Light bulb

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,064
The thread group

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
Comcast

10
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,928
Conversations about what happens when your devices don't work

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,280
And our guest this week

12
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,816
Is Charlie Kindle

13
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,376
Who is the head of Amazon's Echo

14
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,680
So the first thing I have to

15
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,472
How to tell you is for the beach

16
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,312
You're going to want to run over to your echo in Muse that microphone

17
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,616
Because we can keep to the Alexa rule

18
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:53,248
I just said it couldn't talk about it

19
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784
But first

20
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,112
Let's do a quick word from our sponsor Lively

21
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,672
Working on a better connected product

22
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
Don't do it yourself

23
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
Its complex

24
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,768
Could be years before you're up and running

25
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,536
Yours Uke

26
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,816

Dot-com

34
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Okay

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
So

36
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,576
Thanks idly

37
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
Let's get started with

38
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
One more reminder turn off your Echo Bike

39
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
Let's talk about

40
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
Big news of the week

41
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
Which is

42
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,864
I don't know there's not a lot of big news for this week but we'll talk about the thread

43
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
Because

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
Keeping up with the osc

45
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,312
And basically this is like standards alphabet standards

46
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,712
Red is the protocol it's a wireless protocol that kind of competes with Bluetooth or Wi-Fi that was

47
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
Secreted by nest

48
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,016
Silicon labs

49
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
Freescale

50
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
Big

51
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
Crossword

52
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
Fans

53
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
Couple other company

54
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,208
What it's done is it

55
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Low power

56
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,024
Mesh networking standard

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,144
It is also IPv6 compatible which means your sensors can talk directly to the public internet

58
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,960
Is it 8:00 or 2:15

59
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,568
Yeah

60
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
That's the same

61
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
Radio

62
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
Zigbee

63
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
Protocol uses

64
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
Sew-ins

65
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
Together on backwards

66
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
That's

67
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
There

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
Indeed

69
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
Ocf

70
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
Brushes

71
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,720
Formerly the open connectivity Foundation

72
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,000
Which is formerly

73
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,048
Known as IO tivity

74
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,864
This was a standard group that Intel kind of pulled together

75
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,960
To act as a communication to Discovery platform so

76
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,520
But if something's in your house and talking to another thing

77
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
If you like high

78
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,872
This is what can talk to me and how it talks

79
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
And what it can do

80
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,712
I'm in somebody else would be like I refrigerator

81
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
I can accept the following commands to do the following things

82
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
And it's this was a really

83
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,368
Cool idea focused on kind of interoperability

84
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
And it

85
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
Peter with all join

86
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
Which was the Qualcomm standard

87
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
Same thing

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
Qualcomm people ended up going over to

89
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Intel

90
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
And

91
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
Then

92
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
Eocf

93
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
Was created

94
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Kind of

95
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,776
Pull all that in together

96
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
So

97
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,616
Qualcomm now back thread

98
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
If I'm not mistaken

99
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Alcatraz facts

100
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,016
Grouping

101
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
A large hamper company

102
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,208
Is Communications protocols or like

103
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
This is the radio

104
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
Blair

105
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Ocf

106
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
UC application

107
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
Is that make sense

108
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,936
So just like you said the application Level with

109
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:57,568
These are the things I can do my device will tell or expose what it can do what commands what functions

110
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,640
And the radio level is where all the communication habits that make sense

111
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,480
Now there is no timing on their service

112
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Medication and

113
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
That's kind of

114
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
Frustrating

115
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,184
That if you have a device that will be thread certified at some point in the

116
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Unknown feature

117
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
CF

118
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
Certified

119
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
Those two things

120
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
In the summertime

121
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
So that's the idea

122
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
That's the fun

123
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
That's the new

124
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151
I don't know what else to

125
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,943
To say because right now until we actually see

126
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
This could be something

127
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
Yes

128
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,551
It's good for the

129
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,951
Industry as a whole because it does mean that all that standard soup we were talking about you know two years ago

130
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
Even last year even last week

131
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
Sorted out

132
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
That's the Hope every see these kinds of announcements all the time we seen them for years with wireless charging standard and then you saw consolidate

133
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
Weixin overtime between different

134
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,079
Groups different companies different Technologies and approaches

135
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
You're starting to see some

136
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:08,991
Of that in IRT and it's super important because you need interoperability otherwise you've got this

137
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,575
Fragmented mess of products and standards and radios and

138
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Cubs that just

139
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
Add devices

140
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,719
Promise the world but they're little silos and we don't want that

141
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,167
For people who cuz I asked them about what happens with a joint

142
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,727
Because a lot of people actually implemented

143
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
I was told

144
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,591
Microsoft is going to be

145
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,407
Ensuring interoperability between

146
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,431
The ocf

147
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
In all joints

148
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,015
So they're in the process of doing that

149
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,831
For Windows and some other members are trying to

150
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
To do the same thing

151
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
For other platform

152
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
There's no timing on that

153
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
But

154
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,767
That's really good news

155
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
If you were like an alternate doctor

156
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
Because I'll join with super easy just

157
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
Could share what it did

158
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Still emerging

159
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
And

160
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Don't lose hope

161
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,223
Bet on that

162
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
But

163
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
Honey

164
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Baby

165
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Lose a little hope

166
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
Smart bulb vulnerability

167
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:24,767
We should we should have a night this caught my eye because I have three osram bulbs in my house

168
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,327
Houston with my wing coven

169
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
They work really well

170
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,399
However

171
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,703
It wasn't me make sure I get this right

172
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
Rapid7

173
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,335
Came out with a vulnerability report and found

174
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
9 different

175
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,455
Vulnerabilities with the osram Sylvania

176
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
Lightify bulbs now

177
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Some of them

178
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,623
Four of them have to deal with the home platform which is what I use and five of them

179
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,975
Deal with the pro platform which actually did not know there was a profile for nothing

180
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
I'm going to use it

181
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
I just thought that was kind of interesting

182
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Some of these

183
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Items have been fixed

184
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:05,727
It's already some of them have not and there's no indication of if or when they will be

185
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
But one of the ones going to keep once that was fixed

186
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
Is that the

187
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,151
The osram python restoring your

188
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
Home network

189
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
SSID or network name as well as your

190
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,319
Passcode to get into the network

191
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,415
In plain clear text and that's yeah

192
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,183
Security 101

193
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,279
I know it's just it's just I'll say inexcusable

194
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
This point really is

195
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
Yasso

196
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,911
There's some other other issues

197
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,007
Persistent xss in the web Management console

198
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,615
Of the pro side and that's why I didn't see this myself cuz I don't login to control

199
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:48,479
My osram bulbs on a website but apparently with the pro platform you either can or you to

200
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,015
So there was some cross

201
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,039
Scripting

202
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,087
Issues there that could inject

203
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,135
Malicious JavaScript in

204
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,695
Best way take control of things through the browser

205
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,999
Since again I use an app

206
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,095
Don't have that concern but still it's that the problem that one was fixed as well so

207
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:10,751
We should put a link in the show notes of the vulnerability so if you can keep track of them cuz I know that there's not just home users of osram

208
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,335
Wake me up probably some Pro users as well so

209
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
I shall make it happen

210
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:24,575
All right. Speaking of security vulnerabilities there is a lovely story on motherboard by Bruce

211
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
Shania

212
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,975
Spire

213
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
There's no d

214
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Gyros

215
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
Who wrote David and Goliath

216
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
Excellent book if you haven't read it

217
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Aurigny

218
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
Care about security

219
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,919
His story he talked about basically the vulnerabilities that the internet of things is going to

220
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
Kind of Usher end

221
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,527
And it's not like we don't know a lot of this stuff

222
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,855
But he makes a huge prediction in the story which is the next

223
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
President

224
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,487
Will probably be forced to deal with a large-scale internet

225
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
And I was like

226
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
That's a pretty big prediction.

227
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
Some of the things that he's saying that are actually worth

228
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Worthwhile

229
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,007
Are that the government needs to play a larger role in iot

230
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
She want some

231
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Standards

232
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
This is kind of working on this

233
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
For other aspects

234
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:24,735
The internet so it doesn't it it makes sense that this would do this for the Internet of Things

235
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Policing

236
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
Compliance switch

237
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
Could be

238
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,207
I don't know what other agency might get involved there I mean if it's

239
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,559
If it's infrastructure you can even see like the. Or any of the agencies

240
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
Responsible

241
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:45,727
I don't want to agree with him but I sort of 2in that his his prediction of Doom and Gloom

242
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
Is a likely scenario

243
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,615
I mean it's one thing when we are getting hacked for digital

244
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
Information photos

245
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
It's a totally different

246
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
Situation when

247
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
Physical thing

248
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
Better controls

249
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Via

250
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
What you say

251
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
Iot or the internet

252
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
It could be

253
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,279
Taking over or causes death destruction and such a man

254
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:14,655
It's concerning and I think he I think he's right again I don't want to agree with him but I do

255
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
I don't want to see this app

256
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
It's true in a lot of

257
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:22,847
Companies are really like a lot of the big name companies are very focused on his but when we say things like

258
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,663
The awesome stuff you're like really guys

259
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
That's not acceptable so

260
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,039
Let's just light bulbs in a lightbulb

261
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
Probably isn't going to

262
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
I mean I guess you could

263
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,951
Make it go out possibly make something explode I don't really know

264
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
Yeah I mean

265
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Chances are

266
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,351
The light bulb itself isn't going to hurt anything but as we seen through the

267
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,655
Security vulnerabilities we just talked about

268
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,983
Somebody could've been getting network access and then have access to

269
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,055
Other things that could cause destruction in your networks so

270
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,383
It's really to me that's just like I ate a front door

271
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
Into a bigger problem

272
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Yes

273
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,039
And he does some lovely math here if 100 systems are all interact

274
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
Each other that's about 5000 interactions

275
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
5000

276
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Potential vulnerabilities

277
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Resulting for

278
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
Interactions

279
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
300 or interact

280
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
That's forty five

281
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,631
I mean it was exponentially because of all the connectivity

282
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:22,495
So he talks about interconnection being a big issue software-controlled being a big issue the software

283
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,311
Challenges something we talked about on the show before because

284
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
They're basically saying

285
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,943
Today we rely on patching

286
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,551
And kind of continuous support of our OS has to patch our smartphones

287
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
Computers

288
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
But with

289
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:44,255
Devices in the home that are going to be there for 15 or 10 years and have a business model that may not support patching

290
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,655
So it's funny that you mention it because as I was reading through hearing and I noticed that

291
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:56,287
I'd like to know what we've already set a very very bad president when it comes to security patches

292
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
With

293
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
What are the most successful devices

294
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
Ever on the planet

295
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
Smartphone

296
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,711
There are billions of them out there and yet

297
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
Security always seems to be

298
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,623
Talk about but more of an afterthought when it comes to a permutation and especially so

299
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,671
After the sale of the device

300
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,975
And that's because the device makers

301
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Don't

302
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
You know that better

303
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,583
Expend resources to pass these things

304
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
But they're not getting any information revenue from that

305
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:26,239
So it worries me that we've got we've set up a very dangerous trend

306
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
With security patches on mobile devices

307
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
And it's even

308
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,383
It's magnified when it comes out of Qi devices I think

309
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
It is and

310
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
That's one of the reasons why I

311
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
I'm very interested in

312
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
NC nudist

313
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
Says bottles even though I hate the idea

314
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Description

315
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
It may have to be the way to go

316
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Go to support

317
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:49,279
Because it's the device makers are going to provide to do so

318
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,071
Then your I agree maybe there are

319
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,631
Opportunities for companies to do this and

320
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,447
Give people peace of mind you're willing to be a subscriber

321
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Yes

322
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
This is why

323
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,799
Companies like Comcast see an opportune

324
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
Trinity and that was my

325
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,431
In the IRT is because they're going to be the ones

326
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
Patching and focusing on

327
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
Delivering devices in doing so as a service

328
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
No matter what we think of Comcast

329
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,159
Their Xfinity home business actually

330
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,255
They reported earnings this week and as part of that

331
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,607
Their revenue in the other category which includes Xfinity home

332
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
Increased

333
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,703
13.7% year-over-year

334
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,519
So just 644 million for the quarter

335
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,871
Year-to-date so far that's one point

336
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
3 billion

337
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
So

338
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,479
That's not insignificant now

339
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,063
The other Revenue also includes advertising

340
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
And

341
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Is it regular

342
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,951
It's hard to say that how much of it

343
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,255
Applies to their Xfinity home

344
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Bit but

345
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
But I imagine it

346
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
What you doing

347
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Okay

348
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
We'll keep an eye on that

349
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
That's on that side

350
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,799
So maybe a Services model that has a big player checking security

351
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
Comcast get security right maybe that's good

352
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
For the industry overall

353
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
I don't know

354
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
I know people are not probably excited about give

355
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,367
No but you know going back to what we were talking about

356
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:23,743
Potential business opportunity for companies to build Security Solutions or patch solutions for IRT

357
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
I would hope that

358
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,839
My $30 a month for Xfinity home

359
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,167
I think it's their base price animal can't right now

360
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
That they will

361
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,311
Take on that role of patching and keeping things secure I'd love to see them actually

362
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
Run Security reports are scans on your

363
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
You're stopping to say hey we got to the secured

364
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
And I do that every 6 months

365
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
People at peace of mind and you're already paying it

366
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
A subscription so

367
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,343
Implicit to me and I don't know

368
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
Scriber other service

369
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
Is that these devices are secured and patched

370
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
Celeste

371
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
Artwork

372
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
Because

373
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
This was a

374
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
Lovely wait for devices that aren't work

375
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
This ties back

376
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Pandora

377
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
Model 2

378
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:12,127
For a little bit for some customers remote access to the nest actually went out this week

379
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
I don't know what to say here

380
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,759
That's what happened

381
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
They went out

382
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Usher

383
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,047
Possibly not fed during our outage

384
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
Lawson schedule

385
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
So

386
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
We always talk about having

387
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,263
Control a basic functionality on the device

388
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,799
Yes

389
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,383
If your nest thermostat in that case it was just remote access

390
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,431
Which man if you are away from home and wanted to change

391
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
So sorry for you

392
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
So

393
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
That's a little more worries

394
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,183
What if you're on vacation

395
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,279
What's my option for feeding my cat

396
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,095
Right right do you happen to know if

397
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
How long between the outage

398
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,751
We're winning out of started how long it took them to contact customers because

399
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
Do we have cats

400
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
I'm home all the time

401
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,615
H I know they can go if

402
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Worst case

403
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,919
A day without food

404
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
Yeah I'm hoping that

405
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,503
This was a timely response

406
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,087
I'm looking to see if there was a time

407
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
Timely response

408
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,415
Just hoping it wasn't an after-the-fact thing or

409
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,207
4 days later by the way

410
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,791
By the way your cat may not have been fed this week at all

411
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Hopefully you don't

412
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
I don't know what happened in Scituate

413
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
But

414
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,191
What's another word of caution for companies want to be in these spaces

415
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
They need to make sure they're communicating

416
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,543
Quickly with customers when they have issues

417
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,639
I'm not seeing any timing on there now

418
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
So

419
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
What a bummer

420
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,503
But this is like $150

421
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
Peter Katz

422
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
And I'm looking on their their Twitter account

423
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:05,279
RPI baby they sent out emails to people

424
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Email

425
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
No idea

426
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
But

427
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
So the point here is

428
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,471
When do things go out

429
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
This kind of ties back

430
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
Continue talking about the f

431
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
TC

432
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:22,943
And there are questions that we talked about last week which was are you selling device are you selling a service

433
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,991
I think

434
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,807
Pastor that is when something goes out

435
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,111
How much functionality do you have left

436
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
Right so

437
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
And then

438
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,743
If you are selling a service

439
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
What kind of like

440
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
Refund should you be getting

441
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,631
Consumers like when your cable company

442
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
Has an outage

443
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
You can actually fight and ask them

444
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,983
For a refund

445
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:50,079
So if you got an old adage you better get a credit on your bill

446
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
Some people are that way sub

447
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:58,783
So I was thinking about this both because of this but also because last week I told you about the August door

448
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
Tell that I have

449
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
As frustrated because

450
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
I don't have

451
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
Access yet to

452
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,231
They are they haven't turned on the

453
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
Motion control

454
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,303
Or is he

455
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,655
And they said they would have it by the end of June

456
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,495
So I called them and they're said okay now it's going to be the end of

457
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
Sometime in

458
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
So

459
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Sometime in

460
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,663
6 months without

461
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:30,527
What I consider basic functionality in a video doorbell

462
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Two of these acts

463
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,159
For 6 months it hasn't even worked like it's supposed

464
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
When I feel

465
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
I feel like if I were

466
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,327
Any other customer I would be

467
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,607
Asking for a refund

468
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Because

469
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
It's except so many frogs come out better and in the functionality is so you know 50 to 80% of the way there and

470
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,895
Features XYZ are coming soon stay tuned

471
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
And you still invest in it

472
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
Because you assume you're going to get

473
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
The product

474
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
Centos features

475
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,831
Hey what if they never show up

476
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,391
That's a possibility

477
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,975
Abby Weatherford away which is exactly what the case here and

478
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,767
Yeah it sucks

479
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Agreed agreed

480
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,191
Are there any add-on costs that will come with a new features like for the cloud stuff for now

481
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,727
And there may be a

482
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,751
Subscription service

483
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,031
Some of the cloud will be

484
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,847
Okay one

485
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
Wait a minute

486
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
Well

487
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,271
You know say the first three months will be free because you were late you know

488
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,807
Going to waive the fee

489
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
Amazon support

490
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
The other thing is they didn't

491
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,903
Tell me I had to ask

492
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
They did not send me an e

493
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Email

494
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Saying

495
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,815
Hey I know in our press release launching

496
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,375
Medicine everybody reported that this was going to be out by the end of

497
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
But

498
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,751
I guess it comes down to it that people buy the product

499
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,335
Specifically for these functions that are coming cigarette some people may not care

500
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,943
Let me not and and that worries me even more because what if

501
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
A majority of the customers

502
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Don't care

503
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:12,159
And the company has been in generic terms but obviously I'm applying it to August here what if they decide to know it

504
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
Are you the bases and clamoring for this

505
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
America was never great

506
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,119
I don't want to think about that

507
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
Cuz I really want

508
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
The cloud storage

509
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
Lesso

510
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
Although I like it having

511
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,823
Doorbell YouTube

512
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,639
Although it does take a picture of the last time

513
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
So I can see who was

514
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
Even without it

515
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
But

516
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
The motion detection is like

517
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
That's like a

518
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
Basic theme

519
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:45,183
Video doorbell if you're using it for security that is that is

520
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,975
It's important

521
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
So those are thoughts here

522
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
I'd like business models need to adjust

523
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
People need to understand if they're selling

524
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
Service

525
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,959
Probably should communicate better with customers when

526
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,239
Blade

527
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:04,639
And should we think about prorating the cost of devices based on their functionality or should

528
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
What do you expect

529
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,271
And you know that is true

530
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
But

531
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,087
I think if you

532
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,159
We're never going to get anywhere as an industry if everyone just shrugs

533
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
DES office early adopters

534
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
China products

535
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
Feel like really doctor Prada

536
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,048
Okay

537
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,840
News for us is

538
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,888
Racker

539
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,704
How to get to news one you want to talk about tracker

540
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,104
Yeah real quick real quick so I bought V trackers a few weeks ago maybe two months ago love them just found out yet

541
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
Yesterday

542
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,920
The tracker and Elsa's family

543
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
Sharon

544
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
People who

545
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,016
I want to know about trackers

546
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:46,112
These little Bluetooth things that you attach two items keys for Depo wallets

547
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:51,744
You can track them you can make them beep and someone sits at way to help you find lost things

548
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,024
If you don't want to lose

549
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
Tracker already had

550
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
Crowdsource

551
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,912
I'll call it GPS or tracking up devices so that way you could

552
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,472
Have the tire tracker audience

553
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,008
Help you find a lost item

554
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
Data tracker installed on it

555
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:11,200
Now that included family sharing so that way you can create a little private group of families friends neighbors roommate Etc

556
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,272
And we're together to find a lost item

557
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576
If you have it tracker attached to it so

558
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
I can like that

559
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
Yeah that's

560
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,904
Very nice cuz

561
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,232
We had we had stuck a tracker on the dog for a little bit

562
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:28,608
And nobody else can find the dog Striker it doesn't really help get you much so this way

563
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
You can have

564
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,656
Ditto Olive

565
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
The Austin area looking for you

566
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
Yes

567
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
All right and then

568
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,592
This is more industrial news but it's worth it she is having there

569
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,384
Conference this week GE announced

570
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
Predict

571
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Kit

572
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,992
So predicts is there iot

573
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,064
The cloud where you get developers can sign up for

574
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,624
Their own predicts accounts in track

575
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,440
Whatever industrial internet stuff at build

576
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
Applications InTouch for it

577
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,072
What day is now done is created a prediction

578
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
Kit

579
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,888
That's a hardware and software bundle

580
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,424
Connect

581
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
Manufacturing

582
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
So

583
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,776
You can use these kids

584
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,104
They're configured with the Raspberry Pi and Intel Edison and

585
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
GE sold hardened

586
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,432
Platform health field agent

587
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,784
And you can use this to like basically attach this to some device that you want to measure

588
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,160
And it will send that data so we see these things with

589
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,952
You know IBM has deals with

590
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
Barry silicon providers

591
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
2

592
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
Thai

593
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:38,240
Dev kits basically to their Cloud so it's just one less thing that you have to do in braids it a little closer

594
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,080
Two kind of web familiar developers to work with like

595
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Harper data

596
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
If that makes sense

597
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
And yeah that's

598
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,224
That's it but it's it's worth knowing because

599
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,576
Biology is produced platform is probably the top

600
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,112
1 in the space

601
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
And

602
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,928
This was kind of a hole for the

603
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
All right

604
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512

Charlie

635
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
Hi Stacy

636
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,256
Thank you so much for coming on the show today

637
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:43,168
I'm really glad to be here I mentioned earlier when we were talking that I've listened to a couple of your podcast another really podcast listener and I really enjoyed

638
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:46,496
Learned I learned a bunch of space for a long time

639
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
It's fun to see

640
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,312
Other still tons to learn

641
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,384
Everybody we warned you it's getting in the show but

642
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,224
Please if you haven't muted your Echo

643
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,016
So it's not listening

644
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,552
Uso now

645
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Because

646
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
Holy cow

647
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,136
We're going to say the name Alexa

648
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
A lot

649
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
All right

650
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,048
First off I have to start with the question

651
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
Everyone's going to ask

652
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,120
Pretty sure you're not going to answer it

653
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,144
But

654
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
How many

655
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
Echoes have been

656
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,240
We hear between 3 and 4 million

657
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
A lot

658
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
So we can make

659
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,336
Got it

660
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:27,456
Okay Siri is kind of a difficult

661
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
Keep in the market

662
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:34,624
Hungry I think it's a good problem to have I mean we we feel super blast it or in the situation

663
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,184
It may be that I'm a smart home nerd in

664
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,744
II III

665
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Decemberists

666
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
20

667
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
Was it 2015 or 2014

668
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,120
Time flies

669
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,752
Yeah that was November 2014

670
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,544
So when I

671
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Received it

672
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,616
I had all my colleagues were telling me

673
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,176
Stacy why don't you to spend $100

674
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,968
It seems kind of silly I like

675
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
No no there's all the smart home stuff

676
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,320
And that was actually

677
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,624
I'm curious

678
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,208
Is that the killer use case for a lot of people or

679
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
It is

680
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:15,072
You know it is I mean the product gets used across a lot of dimensions

681
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
Sendai

682
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,912
Are we have tons of Reese's Run music and

683
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
Free teen and

684
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728
All the other two buildings

685
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,776
But when we first launched

686
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
The sperm capabilities

687
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
Summer year ago now

688
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,616
We were

689
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,664
We are really delighted with how

690
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,712
Cuz there's a single love it and it was

691
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:37,344
It was interesting cuz he had been working on smart home for a long time my career is but kind of got it revolved around it

692
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,880
Going way back

693
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:39,904
And

694
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,208
Pill

695
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,768
You know this vision of wanting to turn evil

696
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:50,400
People to interact in their homes in the natural way with all these devices and all the cool things you can do

697
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,960
And we discovered with voice

698
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:59,104
Alexa is that the really simple scenarios that are I use the term directed device control where you

699
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,408
You have a device in mind and you say

700
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,992
Sitting on my couch in the living room reading

701
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,064
And the sun goes down it gets a little dark

702
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
I'd like to have some light on

703
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,160
I could get up and walk across the room flips light switch

704
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,952
I'm going to get my smartphone out

705
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:19,328
Start with a rapid is I used to control my smart home you first find it after unlocking my phone

706
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,632
Navigate into that particular light

707
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,448
You press the button in light comes on or I can say

708
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
Alexa turn on the reading light

709
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,008
And

710
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,080
You don't get down. Sing it all the scenarios

711
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,944
We envisioned around smart home going back to 1974 when X10 was invented

712
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,504
That's a really simple scenario

713
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
It's like the most basic

714
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,088
And it turns out he's also the most

715
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
And customers just

716
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,672
Are demanding more and more and more

717
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:47,232
And so it was worth all that you know when we were

718
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,792
The first one more like yeah we're onto something here

719
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
My understanding is that was

720
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,168
The smart home control is actually a relatively late

721
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
The product

722
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:02,592
Well endowed achievement play after it launched after Alexa has been in beta for a while it was

723
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,152
Marches for April last year

724
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,456
When we when we first enable

725
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,480
Nicole lights

726
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:14,880
So Alexis always improving you know we we launched new capabilities every week across-the-board we have

727
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,208
Since the beginning or continuing to double down on that aspect of it

728
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,024
So it's kind of hard to say that was a really nice developer or not

729
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,912
This is a device that is totally like

730
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,936
You could pry it from

731
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
My cold dead

732
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,240
I can't imagine my house

733
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
Stop it now

734
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,056
What speakers

735
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,336
I will say that

736
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,128
I have a hard time now

737
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,944
Navigating some of the things I can do with

738
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:45,344
That's just simply a limitation of understanding the right commands to say

739
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:52,256
Bruce Lee understanding the right commands to say so if I'm trying to do a conversion I feel like I have to remember special syntax if I'm trying to

740
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,304
Syntax

741
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,120
What voice does well and what

742
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
Doesn't it do

743
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:05,056
Well it is always getting better and that's the beauty of beauty machine learning and in these deep learning techniques that we

744
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,896
That we really rallied around and done a bunch of invention on

745
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,176
And

746
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,456
Football today there's

747
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,528
There's no complicated things that she doesn't get right

748
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,576
And it does get right

749
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:20,160
It's just it's just a matter of time really in in the morgue

750
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,464
It's a shame more people use it the better it gets

751
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,048
There are some parts that are awkward to use a term called multi-turn

752
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
4

753
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:31,168
Whereyoueat talk to Lex and she talks back to ask you a clarifying question or whatever

754
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:34,496
And all the time those are those aren't really human like

755
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,824
And it's our goal to continue to invest in

756
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,128
Making it even more more natural

757
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,456
You guys had a remote shipping with the original beta

758
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,528
And then it kind of dropped off the product and now it's a separate

759
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Was that

760
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,368
The result of anything you saw in

761
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,952
I'm kind of debating users like I didn't use my remote very much at all until I

762
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,768
Remembered I could bring it upstairs and then basically have two echos

763
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:03,936
Optional thing for customers and

764
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,008
We just as much cost as possible

765
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,848
Let's talk about the smart home API

766
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:14,688
Because right now you directly into a couple products

767
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,736
Like lights thermostat

768
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,576
They just they just work I don't have to have a skill for it it's just there

769
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,416
What is your vision for kind of expanding the smart home API

770
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,184
Program

771
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:32,096
Yeah it starts with imagining all of the types of devices that customers going to have in the physical world around

772
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,656
That they want to use an intelligent

773
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,192
Voice agent to interact with

774
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
And

775
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,544
Wait look out in the future of the things I've done in the past

776
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,128
And anything you can imagine we want to enable in a

777
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,920
Safeway

778
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:52,320
Very deep integration around and it really ends up being about The Primitives of those devices and so if you look at the lighting API

779
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,392
Smart Hub supports today at that lowest level

780
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,184
It really boils down to

781
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,232
On off brightness

782
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,072
The thermostat API it's really about temperature

783
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,400
And you leave a brightness and temperature there there a gradient right

784
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,472
And so as we build out the API we have to think about those with the

785
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,496
Primitives are

786
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,032
And then with the business logic

787
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,848
I'm required within the API test

788
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Port mapping

789
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:21,504
And did the goal is to go after all the device types are out there and as we do that we develop more more

790
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
Primitives

791
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
They're useful for other types of devices

792
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,368
Example of customers today

793
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,648
Use the fact that

794
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,672
You can turn

795
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,208
Lights on and off

796
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,232
With a non-directive

797
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,304
And that same thing applies to anything that can be turned on and off

798
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
So in my house

799
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,912
A little embarrassed to say this but I have about 200 devices

800
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
It Alexa

801
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
Uncontrollable bile

802
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,032
The majority of the Ozarks

803
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,360
Majority those are lighting loads I have a house that has a

804
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:52,224
A Lutron lighting system in it and I built a custom skill adapter for that

805
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,064
That allows me to interact with this some kind of Legacy 2001

806
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,624
Generation Lutron lights lighting system

807
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,464
Something like a hundred and twenty of those loads are

808
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,744
Are lighting loads

809
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,096
The other ones are things like my television to my fireplace so I can say Alexa turn on the kitchen TV

810
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,888
And I can say

811
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,704
Alexa turn on the living room fireplace

812
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
Turn off living room

813
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:20,128
And so that's going back to town original question which is even how we View

814
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:26,016
A supporting multiple device types of her time is pretty much anything out there in the way we do that is by

815
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:30,368
By focusing on that have a deep vertical scenario like lighting or thermostat

816
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:34,976
Imma get that right and he's got the right Primitives and then enable is permitted to be used

817
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,024
For other devices well

818
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,656
Affordable Smart Home

819
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:48,800
You had people wanted to do things like door locks

820
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
Send

821
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,896
You guys now have a skill for the August door lock

822
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,432
But that is not yet

823
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:59,808
Smart Home

824
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,624
Verbally being able to control the security of someone's home

825
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:09,280
I think that what we want to do is enable customers have a control and do the scenarios they want to enable and we have to be

826
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
Someone

827
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,352
Patient and cautious about that

828
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,888
The August door lock

829
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,168
Skill for Alexa

830
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
Is really cool

831
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:21,056
It enables you to to know the stadium of whether or not doors locked or not so you can ask Alexa

832
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,360
Alexa ask August if the door is locked

833
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,408
And it's not locking

834
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
Aldo support unlock

835
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:32,064
And as we talked to all the locks Riders out there their they're also very reticent

836
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,112
Send text to support unlocked at all

837
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:37,952
I'm even within the mobile app for the reason cuz you really don't want people to be able to

838
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
Unlock your door

839
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,024
Without really having great

840
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
About that

841
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:46,144
And so it's our business we build this out to invest heavily in the

842
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,960
In the scenario is it and make sure that that those things are

843
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,264
A safe and secure for customers

844
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,568
Okay so like voice biometrics

845
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,640
There's all sorts of

846
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:01,248
Types of authentication mechanisms and so forth that were investing in overtime

847
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
So what are the things that people

848
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,832
Email me a lot about they ask

849
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,624
Should I buy the echo Dot

850
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Because

851
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,184
It feels like

852
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,720
It's been out for a while

853
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,024
Amazon could release a new version of this

854
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,120
Dispersions powerful enough and all the improvements

855
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
Turn the clouds but

856
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,424
What would you tell those

857
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
People are like

858
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:28,128
I don't think they should be I think the devices that that we built today are

859
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,664
Super high-quality

860
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,456
They've been engineered

861
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:37,856
With long life cycle in mind and most of the intelligence of Alexa and most of the power is actually in the clouds

862
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,928
Device has very little and then I was a very intentional design

863
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,208
To make sure that

864
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,096
Customers investment in the hardware would last over a long. Of time and the product and always get get better

865
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:54,496
Coyote and not really sure what I have T names for what are the things that I do like about some of the definitions is

866
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
The idea that it

867
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,824
Music devices you buy

868
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,872
Are always getting better and they're not

869
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,664
I want it done type of thing

870
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,224
What is Amazon's Vision around

871
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,552
I still like smart home was a killer app for it

872
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,088
Now that you guys now that I can

873
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,624
Buy things on Prime

874
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,416
Super easily without having ordered it be

875
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Before

876
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,744
It feels like shopping could be

877
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,280
Really interesting

878
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,096
It doesn't feel I guess to me it doesn't feel as exciting is

879
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,376
The smart home stuff but

880
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
Be curious like

881
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,424
Where you guys been

882
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,264
Tell Jeff Bezos said it multiple times

883
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
Reviews

884
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
The vision is near crate what

885
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,616
Reviews on Star Trek

886
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,432
Star Trek computer but for the home

887
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,968
The course of human history

888
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,272
Tens of thousands of years ago when

889
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,064
Human communication started

890
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
Eunos predominately

891
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
Voice

892
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
Sound

893
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,744
It seems he's all sorts of other cues that use the sense of sight

894
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,280
Caring

895
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,328
And smell to communicate

896
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,376
But speech and sound is

897
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
Is Central to human communication

898
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
And

899
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,472
Up until recently

900
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,776
Computers

901
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,800
Interactive computers

902
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:06,432
I think our vision is a voice has become the technology on voice invention that we've done around far field

903
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:11,296
Voice recognition speech recognition we do in the cloud always getting smarter

904
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,344
We're at the point where

905
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,880
You actually can interact

906
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,440
Computers using natural voice and it's

907
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
Shockingly good

908
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,816
Changes the Paradigm in so we think we're at a point where this

909
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,608
It's kind of similar step-function to

910
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,192
You know what you saw when we moved from character base

911
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,496
Basin racks on computers to GUI

912
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,776
Back in the 80s

913
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,080
And now we're at the end of Tipping Point

914
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:34,848
4

915
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:38,176
Natural user experiences centered around voice

916
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
It doesn't mean that

917
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,992
Voices the only way

918
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,296
Certainly just as humans

919
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,088
Like I said earlier use all sorts of

920
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,112
Other

921
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
Census

922
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,416
Inarticulate

923
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,720
Vocal cords is afford to communicate

924
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
Computer as well as well

925
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,560
And we've sent the vision of Alexa is

926
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,584
Tune able

927
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
Shuman Center Act

928
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,168
With their environment in the most natural way

929
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
What can't voice

930
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
We talked about

931
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
Unlocking your doors today

932
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
But I don't want to

933
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,640
Epicurious

934
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,224
What those scenarios are that you guys are like you know what that's just not good

935
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,832
I think we're going to we're going to let customers dictate that for the most part

936
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,160
Ice the same as

937
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,696
If you and I were in a room together

938
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
There's times when

939
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,536
Saucony appropriate for me to speak out loud

940
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,584
I'm going to kick you under the table

941
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:34,240
Or I'mma send you a message in the same room because it wouldn't be appropriate cuz we're in a library

942
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,032
So I think that there's

943
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:40,384
There's also social norms and environmental issues that will dictate that

944
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,688
Dim the day it's going to be up to customers

945
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,784
When they want to do it in the inside corner of adjectives

946
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,344
To build a system in anyway such as flexible enough

947
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,928
So that all those modes of communication interaction can be used

948
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:59,584
I actually talked to accompany the other day who is Brie whose customers were bringing the echo.

949
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
To business meeting

950
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,912
To answer questions about sales forecast

951
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,496
And I really thought this was interesting when you started talking about

952
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,520
Cultural norms

953
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
I tried it

954
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,872
Picture like the echo with an actual seat at the table

955
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,712
This could really create new cultural.

956
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,808
Set up curious if you guys are seeing those develop maybe you and your license

957
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:24,928
At such an extensive collection or maybe at Amazon

958
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,768
You probably see it in your own household I certainly see it in mine with

959
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:34,656
The social environment you have people over the house and they discover that there's nothing in the room that can talk to

960
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,960
And suddenly becomes the center of the party

961
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,264
Unless that's another example of that

962
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,616
But also I'm one of those

963
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,408
Your crazy smile is easiest

964
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:51,552
She mostly is but but she for a long time is called our house this

965
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,856
Oh my God would love her

966
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,160
And it's and it's really because

967
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,232
First of Technology tradition has been fairly fragile

968
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,024
Particular when it's homegrown

969
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,864
But really I didn't give her a lot of value for the things she wanted to do

970
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,168
She didn't understand the value of

971
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,472
The automatic routines and

972
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:14,336
And the fact you could double tap on this button and it would do something different in Boca scene

973
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,408
These things just didn't Delight her cuz

974
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:21,504
There's two kinds of products in the world is products are vitamins and its products are painkillers

975
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:25,088
And ideally you want to be building something that's a pain killer because

976
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,136
Yeah they're going to beat all demands for that

977
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,672
Because I have to push vitamins on

978
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:32,768
People really frankly the lot of this connected Home Smart home automation stuff for the last

979
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,048
Two or three decades

980
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,328
Has been

981
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,608
In that mode

982
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,424
But we found his voice and in my house it's

983
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
Absolutely the case

984
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
Juvenile

985
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,056
Interacts with the house using voice all the time

986
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:50,432
Never she recommends it to other people had a friend come out to me the other day I'm talking about his wife and he likes

987
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,992
Oh my gosh she's encouraging me to buy smart blinds

988
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,272
Give me a high five

989
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,576
Oh so this way you guys could be a gateway drug

990
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,696
The Nerds are that were Amazon

991
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,792
To the Smart Home

992
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,168
What we should do something about music

993
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,008
I had multiple conversations with people who have high-end

994
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
You know a whole home audio

995
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
Systems with

996
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,872
And then I'll just use the

997
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,664
Echoes giving up on the

998
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,480
The Puritan high-fidelity

999
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,016
The audio file

1000
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
Respective

1001
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,136
So because the convenience of interacting with voice to select the music you want to play

1002
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,672
Is so much better

1003
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,280
And I would also say this touches on something

1004
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,328
The beauty is important which is

1005
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,608
Right now

1006
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Smart home controls

1007
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
Play through

1008
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
Your

1009
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,496
Which I have a 9 year old daughter

1010
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,312
Set so she loves the echo because

1011
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,872
It basically gives our access to a lot of the things in

1012
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,640
In the home

1013
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,175
So I look at this and I think

1014
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,479
This is one of the first high-quality thing

1015
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,759
Devices to

1016
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,295
Work in a shared environment

1017
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,855
I don't know if you guys really thought about that but

1018
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,391
It feels like something else

1019
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:11,071
And we use the term communal internally that resume product is a combination of a very personal

1020
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:17,471
Experience with also something that works very well in those shared communal environment since and it said that the power in the magic

1021
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,263
Far-field voice technology

1022
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:23,615
Let's quickly go into the future skills before I get you for your favorite

1023
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
Amazon Echo

1024
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
Track Santa

1025
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
You guys are making

1026
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,039
Huge strides there so many skills now not even a guess how many there are at the time

1027
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,343
I'm sure it's like baby off

1028
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,415
But there's over 1500

1029
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:42,303
Used to be a mess to find them you guys are now at allowing people enable it by voice which thank you

1030
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:46,143
But how do you say skills playing in two kind of Amazon's

1031
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,983
World is just like a new app store like people like to think of it

1032
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,799
This is one of things where I think we're at day one we're just

1033
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,103
Scratching the surface of what's possible

1034
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,687
We are very explicitly enabling Alexa to be something that

1035
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:04,575
That isn't entire ecosystem that all companies where the hardware company software company service companies

1036
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,599
Can

1037
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,135
Participate in

1038
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:10,207
And get whatever value it is that they want on a vehicle

1039
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,743
Their customers

1040
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,767
And

1041
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:17,631
Are the 1500 or so the skills that are currently enabled that includes the smart home skills

1042
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,959
Or just us to the sampling it was possible

1043
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,727
The

1044
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,263
App stores in the world

1045
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,335
She go back to 2007 when the iPhone first came out

1046
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,895
And enabled the App Store 2008

1047
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,943
The period after that was a

1048
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,527
Yeah I just a fascinating gross. For the industry

1049
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,087
And we kind of feel like there's an opportunity to

1050
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,879
To drive that kind of value

1051
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:42,719
For customers and flexibility and benefits by enabling

1052
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
Anyone

1053
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,767
2

1054
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
Take advantage of this

1055
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,631
Voice experience

1056
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
How long until I

1057
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
Do a custom name

1058
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,239
For my echo

1059
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,847
It was a custom wake word

1060
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,871
Accustomed

1061
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:07,039
Yeah you know we support Alexa Echo and Amazon today and we got lots of lots of

1062
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,087
SUNY able

1063
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:13,951
A Mother's Day out of his specific ones they want and indefinitely customers ask about having

1064
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:20,351
It's a very very hard problem requires a lot of invention each time you do if you have to get it right you have to

1065
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,631
You have to make sure you don't

1066
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,679
Have what we call too many false

1067
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
Except

1068
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,751
Which is when the system

1069
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:31,871
Here's something else I hear something and thinks it's the Wake words you can't have false rejects which is where

1070
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,711
You say the Wake word in the system doesn't hear at end

1071
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:42,111
So we're continuing avastin that we've we've been going to talk for shipt it was just Amazon

1072
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,415
Amazon Alexa and we added a collator

1073
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,463
And something there always work

1074
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,743
Okay

1075
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,047
Now for everybody's favorite part

1076
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,071
Tell us

1077
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,351
Your favorite

1078
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,375
Tips tricks

1079
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
Skills

1080
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
Nutella

1081
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,703
What do you like to do with your neck

1082
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,495
Or what would you tell other people

1083
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:05,663
I've done is using Echo dot which has I'm audio out so you can connect to other speaker systems

1084
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,967
I have several Echo dots around my house

1085
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,807
Connected to my my multi-zone audio system in my house and so

1086
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:16,159
I can say I can stand in the kitchen which is next to the dining room and I can say

1087
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,719
Alexa turn on the

1088
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
Living room speaker

1089
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,071
And out of the dining room speakers I was there her say okay

1090
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,887
And then I can say Alexa play

1091
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,703
Dark Side of the Moon on Spotify

1092
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
And

1093
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,519
All that music will fill

1094
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,311
Both dining room and living room

1095
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:37,663
And it's really easy to set this up if you have a whole home audio

1096
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,735
Just like this you can either use the analog audio out to that

1097
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,575
Or you can use a Bluetooth audio receiver

1098
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:49,439
I actually do that in my master bedroom and this morning I love Flash

1099
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,791
Yeah I guess in the morning and I'm in the bathroom when I say

1100
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,327
Alexa what's up

1101
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,167
And she starts playing my flash briefing with tries customized for me

1102
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,239
Play the new sources I care the most about

1103
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,311
And that comes out of the speakers in the ceiling

1104
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,895
Stop my master bedroom because when we built the house way back when

1105
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:14,271
And the way that I wire that up is not a little Bluetooth audio receiver

1106
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:19,647
Connected to the power amplifier for that in the Echo dot connect to that Bluetooth audio receiver

1107
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,463
That's kind of a fun thing you can do

1108
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,047
Obviously I use the smart home stuff a lot

1109
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,583
For me it's just so nice to be

1110
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,143
Going to bed and be able to say Alexa turn off

1111
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
Kitchen TV

1112
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,567
That's a really really mundane things

1113
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:40,127
But it's to me and my family

1114
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,687
Unbelievably delightful

1115
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,223
It is fantastic

1116
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
As I

1117
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:49,087
Turn off the fish tank light

1118
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,647
I got a WeMo plugged in there so I'm just like

1119
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,927
Turn off fish tank

1120
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,023
Fist bump right

1121
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,303
I actually still do

1122
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
Privacy

1123
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,727
