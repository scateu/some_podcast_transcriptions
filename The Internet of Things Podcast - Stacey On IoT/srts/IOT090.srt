00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
Coyote

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,888
Listen to what they think about living

23
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
Always changing

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,520
You know what's a mood booster for Cranky Pants people

25
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,056
Alcohol

26
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,360
Okay well that's a given yes

27
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,152
Super Mario run

You can't be unhappy playing that game on

29
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
Okay

30
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,272
What will keep that in mind

31
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,160
Look at Kevin's review on the latest

32
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
But first

33
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,768
Let's have a word

34
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,072
From our sponsor

35
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,888
This way sponsor is level education

36
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:48,288
Level education is going to help you guys prepare for the future with iot training they teamed up

37
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
Set up with Cisco for an iot core program this is a 15-week program it's a blended

38
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:01,088
Learning experience for iot foundational knowledge there's a lot of Hands-On learning opportunities

39
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,184
World examples hackathons and project-based learning

40
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,464
You'll emerge for the

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
Experience has quote

42
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
Iot ready

43
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,328
The course starts February 13th

44
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,216
And to find out more go to level edu.com iot

45
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,056
Best level edu.com

46
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,944
Okay that actually sounds pretty cool I know that some people have been asking me about kind of some course worked

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
Prepare for the iot future

48
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
This

49
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
Level education + Cisco my

50
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,832
For you

51
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Sounds good

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
Talk about

53
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,816
Yeah I was kind of hoping Zuckerberg would have built like the actual Iron Man suit with Jarvis but no no no you just built

54
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
Jarvis

55
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,424
But I have to confess I've never seen Iron Man

56
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,472
In my brain

57
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
This is like his digital butlers

58
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
We're not friends anymore

59
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,456
Woodspring Kevin

60
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,992
Okay

61
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
Jarvis it yes

62
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,296
Jarvis is the

63
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,088
Artificial intelligence that

64
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
Tony Stark

65
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
Built

66
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,744
Not just for the suit but for his lab and everything else that he interacts with like

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
Jarvis is

68
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,584
Pervasive in everything that Tony has

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,656
However yet most people do equated with the Iron Man suit

70
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
Okay so it's like a less murderous house

71
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:25,824
Yes that would be well I mean it is certainly has attacking her people but they say they were

72
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
Zuckerberg built his

73
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
Jarvis /

74
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
How less murderous hell

75
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
And

76
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Did it work

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,464
It does work if it's limited but it works and and this is what does October gets spent as he said his

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
Personal challenge

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,584
For the year 2016 it was to build a simple AI to run his home

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
Just like Jarvis in Iron Man

81
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
And

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,240
He only spent a hundred hours I taste pretty darn talented because

83
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,800
He actually does have a fairly

84
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
Complete system

85
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,128
He's got a server piece to it

86
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,992
It interfaces with various home systems such as Crestron system

87
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,856
Thermostat d'orsogna Spotify etcetera even a toaster which is kind of neat

88
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,928
He has user interfaces that he built

89
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,744
I want is a Facebook Messenger bot

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,559
Sorta makes sense considering he's the CEO of Facebook

91
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,911
He has an iOS voice app and he's got an Android version

92
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
Planned so I don't

93
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,031
Nobody's going to do with these different versions baby switches phone that's cool

94
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,639
I am outside the door camera as an interface which will talk about a few minutes how that works

95
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:38,015
And then he's got some a I built into it with language processing speech recognition facial recognition so

96
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
But long story

97
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
Short here is

98
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,439
That he's kind of replicated what you can mostly get

99
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,487
From an off-the-shelf systems

100
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,303
Through an echo or Google Assistant Siri

101
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
And various third-party products

102
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,399
But it's really interesting he

103
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,191
Tackle this as a learning project

104
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,311
Obviously learned a lot route up a really long post on this which I highly recommend the read

105
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,151
But also in doing this he figures AI

106
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,527
Natural language processing is a good 5-10 years out from what he really wanted to be

107
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
And

108
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,135
I think it's important because here somebody who's in the nuts and bolts of things

109
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
And that's

110
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,023
Kind of a different message in some people taking away from media stories and product reviews inside

111
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Actually

112
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,167
This is this is kind of fun he talked about on a psychological level

113
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
Once you can talk to it

114
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,519
System so he was talking about using both text

115
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
Invoice

116
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
To communicate with

117
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
What does Jarvis and he actually

118
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
Thanks

119
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:42,527
Text is actually a really good user interface and he focused on that because he doesn't think that's going away anytime soon

120
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
But

121
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,111
He mentions that when you can speak to a system

122
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,927
You attribute a lot more emotional depth to the

123
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
Then you might otherwise

124
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
And actually

125
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,607
He says that once he built voice into Jarvis you also wanted to build more

126
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
Humor

127
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,727
Later on in the show my daughter actually talks about this how she what she likes about

128
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,287
The echo is that has metaphor

129
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Personality

130
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,127
I would actually agree to

131
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,455
After using various a smart assistant systems

132
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,855
I mean when I talk to my echo and she does only for me I almost always say thank you after work knowing full well

133
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,183
Knowing full well she doesn't care not listening whatever

134
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
She's not really there

135
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,559
But yes there is definitely a more of an emotional

136
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
Connection

137
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
2

138
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
The interface adapter

139
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,239
Guess which is why you should always treat your children to be polite to

140
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:42,687
Yeah but I also thought was really cool about this is he talks about the role of

141
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Image record

142
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
Technician in computer vision

143
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
In his system

144
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
And I stink

145
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,879
You know we do have things we can talk to him

146
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
Stuff happens what we don't have

147
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Yet

148
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,791
Is really high quality computer vision that can tie into

149
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,119
Like the people who live in our house so I seen it

150
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
But in this case

151
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
He built

152
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,751
With the camera out his door he he tied that like

153
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
The computer

154
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,103
Recognizes the person and then the person is also on his calendar

155
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
To unlock the door for the

156
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
That was a tough use case

157
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,319
Yeah and that's that's not something that you can buy off the shelf these days that I that I know of

158
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
Instead it's all

159
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,207
There's somebody at the door let me show you who it is and then you as a individual have to

160
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
Unlock the door say

161
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,095
Echo please unlock the door etcetera so he's taking it a step further there

162
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
I'd like to see more of that

163
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:38,239
Couldn't sleep because again that brings we start telling systems together I took before

164
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,799
That's when you truly bring the smarts into the Smart Hub

165
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,359
So I could see something like the August

166
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Door lock

167
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
Could do that

168
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
You don't recognize your face when the doorbell

169
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,015
And then unlocks the door ahead of time

170
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
For you based on that

171
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,135
But I think that's actually something even if the Technologies there

172
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,439
I don't know if the average consumer is

173
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,279
And there's also the issue of things like

174
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,607
Can you forge Forge way through for just popping up

175
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
Words but some of these

176
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
Smooth your face yet

177
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
True and and granted if

178
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,591
Like if somebody was

179
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:19,199
I don't know it's a bad person took me to my front door and I didn't want not want them in my house

180
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,295
But they use my face to get in at that point you don't because the computer still comes on

181
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,903
That's obviously not good it's a extreme case

182
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
Restaurant

183
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
I don't have to sexual though

184
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
Cookies from a sari

185
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
So maybe don't want to

186
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,983
I just think we need the intelligence to make it work

187
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
The way you want it to work

188
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Okay

189
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Is that only one

190
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Talk about

191
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
Yeah now let me recap the Iron Man

192
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,711
Movies free no no

193
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
I'll watch them eventually

194
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
All right

195
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,623
Also so we're talking about spoofing things

196
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Hand

197
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Security again

198
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,511
News of the World of routers there is a new

199
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
Attack

200
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
Vulnerable home

201
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Working routers

202
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
And this one

203
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,191
It changes your DNS settings

204
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983
And redirect your traffic

205
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,543
Too fragile it domains that can

206
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
Further cause harm to your

207
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,711
Yeah and secure networks as well there's all kinds of funny business going out oven

208
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,759
Once you lose control of your router that's

209
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,343
It's like losing the key to your front door to go back to the last story in

210
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
You let people in that point to do whatever

211
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,951
And this is called so

212
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,999
This place called DNS changer

213
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
So

214
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,911
Looks to see what your IP address is and if it's interested in having a

215
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,727
Get your IP address it's like I'm taking over

216
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
What can alter your firmware

217
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
Yes I did instead was just bad all around

218
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
How can you

219
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
Stop

220
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:58,015
That's a good question don't buy one of the router Center

221
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,319
I'm not sure I just

222
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,391
It's proofpoint that sounded a reported this issue

223
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,487
And that they say it's impossible to list all of the vulnerable routers but

224
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,607
They did mention three in particular for what it's worth the D-Link dsl-2750b are

225
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:19,007
Netgear wndr3400 V3 and related models and the Netgear r6200

226
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Hundred

227
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
Doesn't mention

228
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
6200

229
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Previous

230
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:29,503
If there was another Netgear vulnerability disclosed I think that was one of the Molnar

231
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Routers

232
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:37,183
So is it right this makes me wonder at you know like I have an onhub and I

233
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,255
Last week makes me wonder if

234
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,351
It's at least on the surface I think it's good to have a router that has

235
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,703
Auto firmware updates coming from the cloud like Google will automatically push updates

236
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
If they're monitoring for these kinds of things that are just mean Google I mean

237
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
Does other companies do this as well but

238
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,127
Air monitoring for these things maybe that is a good

239
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
Way to

240
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
Quickly address them

241
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,735
That's true of all of your router suddenly start

242
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
Like if a whole swath

243
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
Have your gear as a router

244
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,159
Suddenly connect to a different place

245
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:13,023
In that place has the same place like to grab it smaller

246
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,607
That's actually something that any connected

247
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
Company so any iot

248
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
I think that's actually a

249
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
Big security thing that you should be

250
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,311
If you don't have an ionic or some sort of

251
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,151
Heuristics like a statistics sampling on your devices to

252
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
Notify you when these things happen

253
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
That's probably a prop

254
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:38,111
And most people would not have something that that would notify them so you know maybe again the cloud-based

255
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
Monitors

256
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,951
On routers may be helpful I know obviously that the onhub

257
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
Mywifi Google Wifi do this

258
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Euro is

259
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
Connected

260
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
Right

261
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,911
I'm trying to think if Luma and some of the other newer type

262
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,239
Mesh networking ones are cuz a lot of mass for your

263
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,799
Email address and I keep track of things

264
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
Some people don't want to do that but

265
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,127
There may be a benefit to doing this

266
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
I know that we're all okay

267
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
What are pros and cons to this

268
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,295
Being able to keep an eye on your stuff

269
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
And where it goes

270
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,879
Is probably a really important

271
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Element of security

272
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
Right

273
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
I would agree

274
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,815
I am not that I condone people wear support

275
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
The idea of using your

276
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,911
Modem from an ISP or as a router

277
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
But then again there

278
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Well

279
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,031
Equipped to Monitor and handle things to

280
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
Okay

281
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Let's see

282
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,919
We've also got

283
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,991
Yeah we had GPS

284
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
Serve in the military here in the US and

285
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
I'm just going to become a

286
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,367
Location standard beehive glonass

287
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
For ages as well

288
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,207
Now there's a new GPS

289
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
Galileo

290
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,303
And this is Europe's GPS system that's

291
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,375
Been in the works for a long time but they now have finally

292
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:59,263
Enough satellites in orbit 18 right now with 30 projected by 2020

293
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:04,383
And Galileo what is it bring the table is different location

294
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,735
This would you location to within a meter for everybody and if you pay

295
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
At a premium

296
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,855
You can have the location down to a few centimeters and I was thinking who you know

297
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,439
4 cars the difference between a centimeter and a meter is

298
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,767
Pretty drastic and pretty useful socar smart cities

299
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,631
Obviously not useful and phones and actually will be available in phones that meet

300
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:30,239
Galileo's approval and turns out that a bunch that are already on the market

301
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:35,615
Bunch of chips the Snapdragon 650 617 625 and 820

302
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,919
Actually 10 use

303
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
Galileo's

304
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
Location services

305
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,551
It's just I thought it was interesting cuz I haven't seen a lot of change

306
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
GPS

307
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
In the past 10-15 years

308
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
Yay

309
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,767
Let's see what else

310
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
Do we have we have

311
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,631
We have this $200 Smartwatch for $199 smart

312
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Watch

313
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,031
I kind of miss the sun Kickstarter nothing I follow a lot of Kickstarter projects but it's actually out of Kickstarter available

314
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,591
Directions to company for $199

315
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,639
It's called the ticwatch 2

316
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
And

317
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,735
Normally when I see a hundred $99 Smartwatch in like

318
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
How much can it really do in

319
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,415
But this is surprisingly getting good reviews it's built on Android 5.1

320
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:27,071
Not Android Wear which is kind of interesting it's not the standard Smart Watch flavor of Android and Scott

321
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,399
Nice skin on it of Android and

322
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:35,007
It does the basic subunits it's great for health tracking exercise

323
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,591
Smartwatch notifications obviously the time you can change the

324
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,663
The watch face can be customized and

325
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
What's an Android and iOS so

326
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,551
Kind of surprised about the positive reviews I thought I mentioned it since so many

327
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,879
Apple watch iPad 599 from Apple watch for 199

328
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,927
Maybe I'll get on the App Store

329
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,743
Could use on Apple watch but Franklin not use a nap so

330
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,047
You just want the basics might be worth looking at

331
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Also say

332
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Seen it

333
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,775
What do we call seeing at it's a tech publication and they have great smart home coverage I love rye crisps

334
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
Light bulb reviews

335
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
So very thorough

336
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
They are launching a

337
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,575
Matrix

338
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
Are you on if this then that or you

339
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
You working from home kit

340
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,207
Devices that work with them

341
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,559
So this thing for consumers who are like

342
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
It'll probably like hills have

343
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
My job which is

344
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
Does usually cause cancer

345
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
Will it work with MyQ

346
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
Should I buy the Hue or

347
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,847
Peter that the wink system and I'll be like oh here will tell

348
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,431
It's interesting cuz we've had pointed out a

349
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,991
An online site that says what works with what

350
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
I figured with an actual name of it is

351
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,415
And it's been a great resource for me but I don't think he gets a lot of attention from a lot of things going to be easy to find where is

352
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
This sounds very similar

353
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:03,071
But would be much more accessible to more people I think it's pretty wise I've seen that to put this together

354
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
Smart Home Depot

355
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
That's the one

356
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,495
It's so easy to remember

357
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,055
I just ask Jarvis.

358
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Okay

359
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
No

360
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
To you

361
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
Which is we thought it

362
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
You guys made Jessica

363
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,087
That's fine replaces idea

364
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,439
I thought I'd share some of the things

365
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,255
We've done it we've connected in our house

366
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Houses

367
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,863
To help you guys like think about

368
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Some of this stuff

369
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
Because honestly some of the stuff

370
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,239
All use cases are pretty highly individual

371
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
And it can be kind of

372
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,591
Overwhelming to be like wow I can

373
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
Turn my lights off for my phone

374
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
That's not exciting

375
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,503
If you can turn your lights on voice command then it is

376
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
We decided

377
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,135
Talk about some of our iot use cases over time

378
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
What we've done with stuff that we

379
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
I'm going to tell you about

380
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
Tracking my daughter

381
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
Bathtub

382
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Time

383
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
And rather whether or not she was flashing

384
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Too much in the bath

385
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Back when she

386
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,055
So this is no longer

387
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
In my house

388
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
What I had I had a SmartThings system

389
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,967
And I took a SmartThings water sensor and I put it next to her

390
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Bathtub

391
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,063
I could either have it notify me

392
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,623
Or I could have it turn my light on or off

393
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
To let me know if

394
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
The water sensor

395
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
Was what

396
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,023
And this isn't me leaving

397
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
1 year old

398
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
6 year old in the bath while I'm here

399
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Just down the hall

400
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
And

401
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,239
Little kids that get excited they splash

402
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
A little splashings okay a lot of splashing

403
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
Hey

404
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
Nice

405
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:00,063
I'm going to cheat a little bit and recycle one of my older ideas just because

406
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
It is

407
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,647
Giving me so much peace of mind and I think it's useful

408
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,487
What we think about scheduling things in a smart home

409
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
We tend to

410
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,607
Think of the basic senior like turn the lights on at sundown

411
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,911
Continuing the various rooms and turn them off

412
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,215
You know when the Sun rises and so on and so forth

413
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:22,847
Deborah time-based but sometimes you want some my schedule and you don't know the time and I know that sounds weird

414
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,687
But I know a few shows ago I mentioned that my son who works

415
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
Really odd shifts

416
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,575
At the convenience store to work cycle come in at midnight or 2 in the morning for tomorrow I never know

417
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,647
He was leaving the stupid front door open all the time

418
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,207
And so I would never know when that was going to happen

419
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
So what I did wasn't like there's gotta be a way to do this

420
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,863
Anyway to have the door locked behind him regardless of the time

421
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
So

422
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
I actually did setup using my wink

423
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,775
App on my wink Hub and the Z-Wave lock set

424
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
On the front door

425
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
Saying you know what

426
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,151
If it anytime doesn't matter when

427
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,455
The front door's unlocked for more than 5 minutes

428
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Just lock it

429
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,319
And since then I've never had more than 5 minutes with

430
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
The house

431
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
Unsecured

432
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,415
It's just something I thought of

433
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
Until I

434
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,231
Ashley Rendon the situation so

435
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,535
When you're thinking about scheduling things

436
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,375
Think of things that may not be around a certain time.

437
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,471
I like it I still like can't offer you guys the right way to

438
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,335
Tell your house go to sleep without telling it to go to sleep or telling the echo to make it go to sleep

439
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
I worked on that

440
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:35,295
If it was a way like three of this than that to use your if your mother in your sleep with a device if it's easier

441
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,831
Resting heart rate go below a certain

442
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Mount

443
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
You could assume you're sleeping and then

444
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Shut everything down

445
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
Mechanical

446
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
I did use

447
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Jaw bone

448
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
When I tried to

449
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
Connect my Jawbone

450
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,239
How is my jaw bone is connected to my nest

451
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:00,895
That caused some drama so that was a member that I remember that guy I think in Syria could be done

452
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
Here's why

453
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
Because I don't

454
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,111
Because even though my heart rate is

455
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,159
You know my husband might be up

456
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
And he gets real cranky

457
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,279
When you know he's downstairs reading a book and all the lights go out

458
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,375
Yeah I can say that and then you won't be sleeping cuz he'll be yelling

459
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
Exactly

460
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
Here's a fun in

461
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
Somewhat

462
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Silly

463
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,615
Okay this one's actually also the door locking Arena but

464
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
Evidently practice

465
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,735
So what I did was I actually

466
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
Gave my husband

467
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,319
This is a game using SmartThings

468
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,623
Say I chose mostly SmartThings stuff to do

469
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
I figured that would give

470
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
You guys some

471
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303
When my husband

472
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,095
Was coming home from work

473
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,655
I gave him a SmartThings presence

474
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,775
And then when his car got into range and we left in his car cuz he didn't want the

475
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,615
It actually unlock the garage door

476
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
So

477
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,735
I got these Z-Wave locks on my garage door so basically

478
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,015
Husband pulls up

479
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,416
He automatically opens the garage door with his car and then the garage door like the door

480
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
The car in the garage that automatically

481
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
Fox

482
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,048
It was it was super nice and then

483
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
I also have

484
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
This is through the

485
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,936
If the garage door goes up

486
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
After

487
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
Darkbasic

488
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
The porch lights

489
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
If you drove

490
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Which

491
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,576
Good morning at these things to work together intelligently the better iPhone

492
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:49,184
I have another one and it's actually perfect for this time of year because I used it

493
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
5 years ago

494
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
I like to still use it

495
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,048
We had

496
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
A problem with her

497
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
Christmas tree 5 years ago

498
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,704
And if anybody has pets in the house they might have run into this

499
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
Situation where

500
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
Press

501
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
Whatever

502
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,824
Pets was urinating on the tree

503
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,664
Edit freak me out and I want to know which one it was and all that so

504
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,944
No no you buy

505
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,552
Cameras for security reasons are to monitor things outside the house and so on and so forth

506
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,136
But there's sometimes a good reason to pull one of those from its

507
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,672
No no place

508
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,208
Put it in a place like this I put it

509
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
Right next to my tree

510
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,328
And had a record and it would notify me when there was activity

511
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:32,960
I should turn it on before bed and then woke up in the morning and turned it off so I can get notified all day as people walk around

512
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:37,056
And protect the cats privacy I told him in advance I was going to watch them

513
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
Tell nobody nobody

514
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,664
Yep they and nobody disputes anything or have any

515
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,456
Problems least nominally heard

516
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,760
Aside from the fact that I found out which

517
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,064
Cat in my case was the culprit

518
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
It actually generated a hysterical

519
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
Dirty

520
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,488
Fast video like a diaper video of the entire night

521
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:00,864
And I see my cats are running around and staring the tree and hitting each other and all that so that was worth it right there

522
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
Dfir

523
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:05,216
Video I think I shared it on Facebook five years back and still out there so

524
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,032
But it can be handed it to pull those security cameras in

525
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,872
Monitor for something inside the house when you really need to know what's going on I think

526
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Yes

527
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,688
And I actually use mine

528
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
I use my security camera

529
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
Facing towards my backyard

530
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
And I have a

531
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,112
Motion sensor

532
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,672
You can use a motion sensor vibration sensor

533
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
Or

534
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,048
Bye-bye dog door so whenever my dog would leave

535
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
If it would start

536
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
Recording what was happening

537
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
Backyard

538
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
My dog has a dog door

539
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,728
Recording starts and I did that because my dog is an escape

540
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,752
Artist

541
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,312
I always have to be aware that she might get out and

542
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
If she does get out

543
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,640
I can either get a notification or

544
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,456
I can see how she's getting out so I can Shore up that section of it

545
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Pets

546
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
Make sense

547
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,040
You can also do this with children

548
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
If there

549
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Doing something

550
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,584
An open close sensor plus a notification is a great way

551
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
2

552
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Maybe.

553
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:10,240
Lock certain areas you don't want your kids to be but maybe you want to track who's

554
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,032
Who's doing what are. Who

555
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
When Something's Happened

556
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,384
Thanks so like we had one in our liquor cabin

557
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Then every time

558
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Yep

559
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
Diving

560
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,624
No it didn't make sense though

561
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,208
Okay then that's a perfect use of an open close sensor that

562
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:34,816
People may not think of this thing open close all I wanted my door is one of my windows a security security

563
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,352
It's not just about security

564
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,936
Yes you could even guard your cookie jar Dunt Dunt

565
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
All right

566
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,032
So sorry

567
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
For you

568
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
This is

569
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,896
Hopefully something fun that you can do

570
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,968
And of course you can always connect your holiday lighting

571
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
2

572
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,552
MINI Connected plugs both indoor and out

573
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:00,672
Griffin together and suddenly you can say something like Echo turn on Christmas or

574
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
Turn on Christmas

575
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
And Wallah

576
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
It's like magic

577
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
Yep

578
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,864
It works really well when you're

579
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
You're bleary-eyed

580
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,168
On Christmas morning actually

581
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,472
Coming down the stairs feel like

582
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,544
Mass

583
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,640
I'm sorry

584
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
I don't know

585
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
How to help you with that

586
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:29,088
That's it for this week show I hope you guys have a happy holidays if you celebrate them

587
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,648
And if not I hope you have a wonderful weekend

588
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,952
And we have a gas right

589
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,536
We do have a guest Kevin you're so useful

590
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
We have

591
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,584
To call me Jarvis

592
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,424
Are two deaths this week are my husband Andrew

593
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
And my daughter Anna

594
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,056
Stay tuned for a real-life perspective

595
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,360
Not people like Kevin and I

596
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,640
On what it's like to live

597
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
With the internet

598
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,688
All things

599
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
And Kevin

600
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,552
I'll see you next week sounds good happy holidays everyone

601
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:05,952
Hey everyone this is Stacy and we're interrupting this week podcast with a message from our sponsor sponsor

602
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
Is Samsung art

603
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:12,864
And I have a beer in the director of product marketing

604
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Arctic

605
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Cloud

606
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,472
Before we get started remind the audience once again

607
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
What is art

608
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
Cloud

609
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:26,176
King comforters iot technology to easily and quickly Fed rate between many-sided devices and Cloud

610
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
It's a Federation of clouds

611
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,064
It's a mechanism to facilitate open data exchange between

612
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,880
Traditionally siloed iot devices and Cloud

613
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,952
We provide companies a super-fast way

614
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,000
To connect many solar devices

615
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,816
And applications and deliver new service

616
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,632
All right well I just signed up for this so

617
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
How easy is it going to be

618
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
It's that easy

619
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,568
Let's take an example of a healthcare provider let's say you are

620
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:57,408
Hospital in Yuan to create a patient monitoring solution

621
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,200
You want to use data from

622
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:05,600
Personal health iot devices like a pulse oximeter blood pressure monitor maybe even a sickness tracker

623
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:09,696
These devices were never designed to work together so bathing a solution

624
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,744
Like this is actually pretty hard

625
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,304
However without a cloud we've made it really easy

626
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,192
We've got connectors 2/30 + popular devices diesel connectors we've tested and verified

627
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,728
Chase your device

628
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,264
Is within that mix

629
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
You can

630
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,568
Quickly create devices in

631
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,872
Start getting data from those devices

632
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,712
It's like we've got devices created in as little as four minutes

633
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:35,552
You can also connect surgical devices and we support http

634
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,880
Websockets into DD collapse you have a lot of options

635
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:45,024
In connecting devices and collecting data from them once you have data in artik Cloud

636
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,376
You can now start to use our powerful tools like orchestration engine

637
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,936
Where you can act on many events

638
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,496
How many devices and send many actions

639
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,312
So in the healthcare example again you could

640
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:03,712
Look at you know Wendy oximeter reading exceeds a threshold and let's a blood pressure monitor

641
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Seesaw

642
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,552
Special Andy occupancy sensor in your home

643
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,368
Indicates that maybe you haven't gotten out of bed

644
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
Well that might be caused

645
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:16,256
To send alert to a physician and maybe also to a loved one

646
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,048
So that would be very easy for

647
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,352
It developer to do with artik cloud

648
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:25,216
And finally all the platform entities in Arctic Cloud expose API

649
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:29,824
So somebody better percent point they can start doing more with the data very quickly

650
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,872
Building a mobile app

651
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:37,248
All their building of visualization tool or they're feeding that data into a

652
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
Analytics

653
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,856
So it's very straightforward very easy for the developer to use

654
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,160
And provides a lot of value to come to

655
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,488
I can't wait to get started so where can I find out

656
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,024
You can get started

657
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,632
Today without 3-tier at arctix. Cloud that's a

658
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,424
RTI

659
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,704
K. Cloud

660
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:03,616
Start with a free tier you get access to all the capabilities we provide and you can start building your applications today

661
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:10,016
Hey everyone welcome back to the intern

662
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:15,648
Ran out of things podcast this is Stacey Higginbotham and as a special treat Our Guest this week is

663
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,208
My family

664
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,536
So I have Andrew here who is my husband

665
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
Say hello Andrew

666
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
Hello

667
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,632
And I have my daughter Anna

668
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,656
Who is 10

669
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,704
And has her own perspective

670
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,240
Say hello Anna

671
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,288
Hello alright

672
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,336
This is an exciting event

673
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
Podcast history

674
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,200
Basically what we're doing is trying to help

675
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,504
You understand how the internet of things can affect

676
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Your family

677
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,112
Because they have opinions and sometimes

678
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,648
They're not opinions you want to hear

679
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,464
So let's kick it off with you

680
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:56,864
In the last year we've added a couple more things to our house can you tell me kind of your thoughts about this year and are smart

681
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,448
I think the coolest Gadget will call the gadget we

682
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,496
We tried this year was the June oven

683
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,288
It was also the most expensive

684
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,128
And I think that if we only had one oven

685
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,200
We definitely own a June oven hours are second oven

686
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,272
And I'm contemplating maybe buying it anyway

687
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,344
To add to our collection and replace our toaster oven

688
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,392
Wait before you go on

689
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,184
What made the June oven so can pay

690
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,464
To you and everybody

691
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,256
Andrew is an iot skepta

692
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,048
He is your every man

693
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
Who is like

694
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:31,168
I don't I don't want to leave my light switches on to make things work

695
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:35,264
What I love about the June is its practical right so

696
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,080
For those that didn't listen to your review about that Union

697
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,384
Basically you can put food in it

698
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
And it says

699
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:46,016
This is what I think the food is and if it is then it just Cooks It

700
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:46,784
Cooks it perfect

701
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
Quickly so for example we put

702
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,624
A 5lb chicken in there

703
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
And it said

704
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
Is this a chicken

705
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,488
Yes and then it said how would you like it cooked

706
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
Juicy extra juicy or well-done

707
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
And we said

708
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:07,008
Cooked perfectly and it said how it's done so it's kind of foolproof cooking the other time the other good use case for

709
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,824
What was we were baking cookies and we had guests over

710
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,872
And we went out onto the deck

711
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
So we weren't there

712
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
In the kitchen

713
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,224
But it

714
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,760
Through the iPhone

715
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,832
When the food was done and we were actually able to watch it

716
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:25,952
In case we were skeptical that it was going to actually tell us when it was done because there's a camera on the inside

717
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,256
So it showed exactly

718
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,304
We could actually watch the cookies

719
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
Baked

720
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,864
Which is pretty cool as well so

721
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,400
I think the hands off

722
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,192
Approach the fact that it's

723
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,728
It's kind of idiot proof

724
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,384
I think those are two things about the June I like now it does come with a $1,500 price tag which is about the cost

725
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,200
About how much I think he's were are Ovens cost

726
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,784
Abbott also plays directly into a regular outlet

727
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Which

728
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:56,928
Or if you hadn't up and you have to add a special circuit which I think was a few hundred dollars as well

729
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,952
Okay

730
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,488
So outside of this

731
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
Particular device

732
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,328
What other changes have happened in our house this year

733
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
Oh hey

734
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,168
That was worthwhile or

735
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,192
That was not

736
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
I

737
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:14,848
Hue motion sensors and so we tried this

738
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,664
Where the stack lights this year is that when I tried to wear this year

739
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
It all runs together

740
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,528
The stack lights were also.

741
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,600
Malaysian sew to put this in perspective their couple

742
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,696
Rooms at our house we're having a motion sensor for the light

743
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
Archie

744
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:34,304
In one case there was when we designed our house we

745
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,656
Did not put an electrical outlet in the little toilet room in the master bath

746
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,704
So there's no way to put a nightlight there

747
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,008
And so the stack light was

748
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,848
Was a great solution there because you walked in and had a motion sensor and weak

749
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:50,688
We're able to set it so that overnight it would be a dim light

750
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,736
You know what maybe twenty 30%

751
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:56,320
So that was good solution there but you know the stock had another

752
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:02,720
Hub that we had to add to our Network in so the Hue motion sensor does the same thing for us

753
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
With our existing Hue hub

754
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
So

755
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,864
In motion sensor in that toilet room as well as now in the laundry room

756
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,424
Which was another Little Flower

757
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,824
Heavenly designer house where we put the switch in the laundry room was not a great location plus when you go into the laundry your hands

758
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
Anyways so

759
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,408
I think what else

760
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
Doorbells I know you test

761
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,504
The doorbell is this year and in my mind

762
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,088
The doorbells are the smartest security device

763
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
That we can add

764
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,160
To a house and so

765
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:36,768
Here we kind of went a little form over function I think it first would you agree

766
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
I would

767
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
And we did that because

768
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,328
As you value

769
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,912
I do got this modern house

770
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,960
With all these right angles

771
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,288
And so be August lock I think

772
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,592
Looked the best it's a square

773
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,640
And then the

774
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
Thank you the August 12th

775
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
But the skybell I think

776
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,552
We found work better but it's round

777
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,880
So it still looks nice but both of them I think

778
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928
Better than the ring

779
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,232
But at the end of the day

780
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,512
Your doorbell doesn't

781
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
Connect right away work like

782
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,352
It's supposed to then what's the point

783
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,888
It seems like the August

784
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,472
Doorbell is working better now but for a long time there

785
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,288
I know someone will come to the door and I get

786
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:25,152
Little China my iPhone saying hey someone's at the door so I click connect

787
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,200
And by the time I connected they were gone

788
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:32,576
Because it would take 20 or 30 seconds that was kind of an issue but it seems like it's a lot better now

789
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,648
I should mention this guy Bill is a sponsor of the show

790
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
I also note that you

791
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:41,536
You guys and I'm also curious because I'm times I think some of our issues with our doorbell was

792
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
WhatsApp Wi-Fi

793
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
And this year we changed our WiFi network

794
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
So

795
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,448
Do you feel that our Wi-Fi coverage is better now that we switch to the

796
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,032
I would say did I notice better connect

797
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,080
Tivity around the house probably not

798
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:57,152
But maybe that just means for the most part it was was working

799
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,712
Okay you didn't not notice connected

800
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:05,344
Let's move to Anna because you know you're kind of is grumpy practical person of texo

801
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,184
At a you forbade me to put any connected things in your room

802
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,744
Can you talk to me about

803
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,024
Why you taking that

804
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,120
Because I feel personally

805
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
That

806
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,680
Things that

807
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,960
Teacher's response

808
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,240
Disability and

809
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,264
How

810
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,544
Function works

811
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
In our lives

812
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,384
And I feel like especially when you're

813
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,408
Gallagher

814
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,944
That you need to

815
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,272
Where are these responsibilities and how the world works

816
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,600
Sometimes connected devices

817
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,880
What do those things

818
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
Taurus

819
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
And

820
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,464
We bought learn like

821
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
Like habitat

822
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,304
And where we live

823
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,608
How to operate it

824
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,680
And sad will go depending on

825
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,776
A smart device or a computer

826
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,312
Or technology

827
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
To do it for us

828
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,152
And I just personally feel

829
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
That

830
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:06,016
I want to do some of these things for myself and

831
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
Get the feel of

832
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
Gellan gum

833
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
My way

834
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:16,768
That's not to say you don't use this stuff in our home so what of all the things

835
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,792
What are your favorite

836
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,120
I really like Alexa

837
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,424
Because

838
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,728
She does have apps

839
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
Silly

840
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
Some personality

841
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
Which

842
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,128
I really value because

843
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,688
She's just kind of Les

844
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,968
Robotic

845
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,504
And more

846
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
Like

847
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,808
Interactive

848
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,160
She also would you do things

849
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,440
That we already have two

850
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
To do if Catholic

851
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744
You can't Milly

852
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
Get

853
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,816
A song to play

854
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,120
And I don't know one of your

855
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
I'm speakers

856
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
Youjizz

857
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
Can't do that

858
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,008
Yourself without technology

859
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
So

860
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,824
That's more or less

861
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,640
Something that she can help on

862
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
What about the light bulbs

863
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:12,064
We've got some colored light bulbs downstairs I've offered you colored light bulbs in your room but you said no.

864
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,136
But how do you feel about 10 of our lighting situation

865
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,952
That's just plain fun

866
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,000
Can I get a connected light bulb in your room or no

867
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
No because I feel like

868
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,144
This time it's more about my room

869
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:31,008
Not really like the tech in my room it's just that my rooms already

870
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
Really

871
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,568
Colorful Island

872
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,360
Standout ish

873
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,944
We've also played with some connected toys

874
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,040
Do you have any things that moms brought home to play with with you that you really enjoyed

875
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,880
I really enjoyed little bit

876
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Because this

877
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,928
Time.

878
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,024
Was more about function and it was an activity that we could do together

879
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Awesome

880
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,328
Any other toys

881
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,376
I also really like

882
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,168
The drop kitchen

883
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,448
Because

884
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,496
Was just

885
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,288
Me and

886
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
You

887
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,592
Daughter and mom

888
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,616
Playing

889
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,152
Having fun

890
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:09,920
We

891
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
We're just really

892
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:17,344
Just interacting we are baking together we are both doing one of our favorite hobbies

893
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
It just

894
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
Really

895
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,464
Instead of us interacting with the device

896
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
It was

897
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,536
Accenture acting with each other

898
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,072
Wow that's awesome

899
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,120
How did you feel about the cosmo

900
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,216
Also really nice because

901
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,264
You got to be the influence

902
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,080
There instead of it being your influence

903
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:42,688
It has a personality and you can build up on that personality

904
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,528
I find it really funny because

905
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,576
You can play with it and

906
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,112
You can watch

907
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,904
Emotions

908
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
And

909
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
How it reacts

910
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,976
To certain things

911
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:59,072
And you can teach it new items and help

912
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,912
Get in touch with both the cat world and the real world

913
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
Okay

914
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,472
That's awesome thanks

915
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,568
We brought into our house Google home

916
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,128
And I've noticed Anna that you have a challenge

917
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,664
Where sometimes you

918
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,456
Want to talk to the echo

919
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:20,576
But you're in front of the Google home and so you're like hey and it doesn't respond cuz you're not

920
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,112
Calling it by its name so

921
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,928
I was just curious is it hard to remember who you're talkin

922
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,328
Yeah more or less because the name is kind of stick with me since they're my everyday life

923
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,888
And so when another smart device

924
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,656
Tom's

925
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,728
It'll just kind of confused me and I'm like

926
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,264
Because really

927
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,336
Like Google home and Echo

928
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,896
Both serve kind of the same purpose

929
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,968
So it's based on design that yacht

930
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,992
Two different style

931
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,552
Invoice and other features

932
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,088
But it's really

933
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
Hard

934
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:58,720
Find me because I just interact with one most of the time

935
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
And then

936
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,304
Like a station now they're closer to me

937
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,120
It's just sometimes confuses me

938
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,912
Guys what don't you like

939
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
About her house

940
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
And all of the gadgetry

941
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,568
I personally don't really like

942
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,104
The way that

943
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,664
Everywhere in our house

944
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,760
Is kind of crowded with smart devices because

945
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:26,112
In general I personally just feel like

946
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,392
It's kind of

947
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,696
Helps us operate Our Lives

948
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:30,976
But

949
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:36,352
Sometimes it can get annoying and it just feels really crowded when we have like

950
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,912
Lights flashing and all these like

951
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,496
Smart devices cameras many motion sensors like

952
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,800
To Oliver House

953
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,848
I like everything's connected

954
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,408
And Technology advances on us

955
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
It just

956
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,712
Makes me feel

957
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,272
Really crowded and

958
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Yeah

959
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,648
So I would say so personally I love cameras outside the house

960
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:05,024
For security which is why I like the doorbell's I know there was an incident around our neighborhood recently

961
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,840
Where someone came to to rob a house

962
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
You know having a

963
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,424
You know that doorbell that captures the image

964
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
And such as good

965
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,008
I don't like the idea of cameras on the inside

966
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,080
Just from a security standpoint of them being hacked

967
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:24,224
I don't like the idea of that in our personal lives inside the home being recorded you know that's face it granted

968
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,504
In your case a lot of the

969
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,088
Gadgets you get our beta at best maybe Alpha

970
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,112
So

971
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,392
Which hint

972
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:38,048
Running into lots of issues are the other thing is we bought this Nifty thing to make garlic

973
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,096
Tronix Shades go up and down

974
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,912
Based on time of day

975
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
Well it's been like

976
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,752
Year-and-a-half Fifty Shades of Grey

977
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,800
Just because it hasn't been hooked in

978
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:51,616
Correctly what whatever what hub

979
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,663
It will work on any hub

980
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,967
Merry Christmas to you

981
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,783
For Christmas I will connect the shades

982
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,551
Okay

983
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,111
Cuz I have to admit it is pretty cool that

984
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
You know we've got these big

985
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,463
Windows floor to ceiling Windows facing west

986
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,791
It doesn't matter much in the winter but in the summer it gets warm and so

987
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:14,143
However you had those set up so they went down automatically in the afternoon

988
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
To keep the Sun from

989
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,751
But again was pretty nice when it was actually set up

990
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
Okay

991
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:26,175
So anything that you guys want to see or you you feel like connectivity might be better for

992
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
Like in the coming year so

993
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,527
What isn't connected that you're like if it did this

994
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,855
There's a tough question what isn't connected in her house

995
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
So many

996
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
Yeah that's

997
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
Quite

998
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,767
Hard I guess

999
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,303
You could have connected garage

1000
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
Store

1001
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:43,839
We have Kinect

1002
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,119
Doorbells

1003
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
Flights

1004
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:52,031
Well you know so I will say that from we have tried some things from an Alexa

1005
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,335
TriCity usage what's the

1006
00:42:55,615 --> 00:43:01,503
Yeah I think it's still pretty hard to get good granular idea of how much energy or using so there's no

1007
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,063
Real-time troubleshooting around it

1008
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,879
That is simple to use so that might be interested

1009
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,159
I think

1010
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
That it's less

1011
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,719
New

1012
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,023
Items in our house and more

1013
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:18,399
Like personality so I think that over the next few years

1014
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,423
We

1015
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,959
Could get some of our

1016
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,983
Already connect

1017
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
The devices

1018
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,311
Give them a little more personality

1019
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,335
Because

1020
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,359
It's just

1021
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:31,967
You feel kind of it sometimes feels unsettling to be talkin

1022
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,759
To robot and giving

1023
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,319
Monster robot but if you

1024
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,087
Kind of

1025
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,135
Get to know that robot and

1026
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,927
Not personality like a

1027
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
Human butt

1028
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,743
Because that would be kind of

1029
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,023
Scary but

1030
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,447
Just if it had some personality of its own to add it in a bit of flavor it would be nice

1031
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,751
Guys

1032
00:43:55,007 --> 00:44:00,383
I hold on hold on what are you planning on connecting in our house

1033
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,943
Odexed year

1034
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,991
You know I really want to try out

1035
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,575
Cleverpet connected dog toy I will tell you that

1036
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:14,207
All I know is that going to walk now it's not yours I'm waiting for the Drone that does that

1037
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:21,887
Actually later this week so it's a shame that we didn't get a chance to play with it beforehand but I am going to connect homekit in a

1038
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,727
Which will see if you guys like that or not and

1039
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,263
It's going to break things isn't it

1040
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,079
Things are going to be broken

1041
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,407
And we didn't actually talk about that so you guys are really

1042
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,479
Patient because I know sometimes I come in and you're like Stacy

1043
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,039
I can no longer turn off our lights with our Echo

1044
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,343
That's a momentary issue

1045
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
Just hold on there

1046
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:47,487
Well but I forgot where the light switches now you know I haven't had to use it in gear

1047
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,279
Light switches are big bonus

1048
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,095
Contention I'd like to actually replace more of our light switches

1049
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,399
With Lutron or

1050
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,703
No there's some new gear

1051
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,007
What the Lutron works just fine

1052
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,127
I will say the other day when

1053
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,407
I had to print something

1054
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,455
And the printer wasn't working

1055
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:11,807
I was just standard Wi-Fi networking stuff right then

1056
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:18,463
Yeah I troubleshooted it for 20 minutes and I came down honey do you know why the printer isn't working or you trying out a new

1057
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,023
WiFi Eero

1058
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,303
The plume WiFi pod that I do

1059
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,583
Didn't bother to connect

1060
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,607
The printer to it

1061
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,423
Maybe I need an iot connected testing and

1062
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
Project

1063
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
Flight status

1064
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,263
The Whiteboard

1065
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,847
If you don't need it to be technology-based

1066
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,127
Okay

1067
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,735
Alright well thank you so much you guys for participating

1068
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,295

But not the June oven

1071
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:52,255
Not work on that one alright that's it for this week shows thank you so much for listening
