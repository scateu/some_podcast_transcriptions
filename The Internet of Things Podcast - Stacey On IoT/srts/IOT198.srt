Find out my Kenmore and D-Link makes a pharaoh

30

Apparel customers

31
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,936
Have experienced as much as an 80%

32
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,472
Reduction in time to Market

33
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
99

34
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,568
Support calls in a 10 expire activation rate

35
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,408
Plus they can reuse 90% of their work from one project

36
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
The next

37
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,224
To learn more does it a pharaoh

38
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
Dot IO

39
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,296
That's a f e r o

40
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
Dot IO

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,880
So let's get started with

42
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,208
I don't know the biggest news we probably saw was

43
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
I'm going to go with

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
Google home

45
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,632
Yes a Google had a press only event

46
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,704
Before CS even open on day one

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,032
Discussions about what they were going to do because they have this

48
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
What looks like a ride

49
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
Set up in the parking lot

50
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
And there was a ride

51
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
I went on it

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,456
But the big news was

53
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,760
Really they're trying to expand

54
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:01,600
Make it easier for Hardware makers to implement

55
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Google Assistant

56
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
Devices

57
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,512
Amazon has done with the Echo and the details are scarce it

58
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,536
Coming soon

59
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
For heartburn

60
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,352
Makers and you're talking about assistant

61
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
Kitchenettes correct

62
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
In that

63
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
Almost

64
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
Compares to

65
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
BMO

66
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
Amazon

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
Connect kit

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
But that is a hardware base

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
System that lets you build

70
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,688
Basically slot this thing into your device

71
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
You have all the

72
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
Functionality

73
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Connect to

74
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,344
Google when is in a hardware device

75
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,416
Yet it may one day also have a hardware component

76
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
It's not

77
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
What else should we know about it

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
Right so developers and Hardware makers will find out in the coming weeks how they can

79
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
Unemployment Pat

80
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
There are some new devices

81
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:51,264
I guess you could call them new form factors is a small little 4 inch touch screen

82
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,080
Lenovo device that is

83
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
Looks like a little mini

84
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,408
Google home hub

85
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
Really called the

86
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
Google Smart Lock

87
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
So

88
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,064
The speaker has a microphone backtracking to watch

89
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
Videos on it

90
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,160
At least not yet you're not going to see Google photos on it

91
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
At least not yet

92
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
It's really meant for

93
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
Setting Smart Alarm which it will

94
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,840
Set based on your morning and evening routines

95
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,656
It's only $79

96
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
Set those routines

97
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,520
Well it's probably going to suggest some

98
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
But you could have a ride or you

99
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
You can set your own

100
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
When you think about an hour

101
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,432
Use Google Assistant it knows where do you work when you work

102
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
You're commuting all that

103
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
So based on

104
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
Traffic

105
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,296
I say hey will you get up earlier today

106
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
Etc

107
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
It should take care of that for you they said it will suggest

108
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
Based on your roots

109
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,744
That's pretty cool it will not show you photos

110
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
That's okay

111
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
And now that we're talking

112
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:52,448
He better than like I was Google's news the biggest news I don't know the bigger news might be the Samsung ecosystem

113
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
I'm kind of effort news

114
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,520
What do you think the TV news with

115
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
Remote control with

116
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
Of course your buddy Bixby and

117
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
Matinee and hey Google

118
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
And I

119
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,296
Stepanek coming out of nowhere for Samsung to partner up

120
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
Smart TVs with Apple

121
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
But yeah so

122
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,928
A lot of the Samsung president was

123
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,488
Arie hasit the last ice age two years to be honest

124
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,839
They were very few alipay product announcements and more of the vision

125
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
And that vision is still Bixby

126
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,703
But I think I said last week in a post that

127
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
If they do

128
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,287
Partner up with somebody else

129
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
That maybe that's the white flag

130
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Bixby

131
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
And that's what they've done they are

132
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
Partnering with Google

133
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,967
You'll have Google assistant on all Samsung

134
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
Smart TVs

135
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
This year

136
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,135
The family Hub is getting upgraded the family Hub 2.0 and that's for the fridges

137
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
Things I've integrated screens I mean they showed up

138
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
Photo frame

139
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
Picture of that again but I

140
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,327
You don't want to spend $1,000 on a fridge for a photo frame

141
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
However

142
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
It did have recipe suggest

143
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
Chin through Bixby

144
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,263
Nano however is here I'm not going to spend

145
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
$8,000 on a fridge with a giant

146
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
Ice cream that has

147
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
Limited value

148
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
Another drink and you might

149
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
Yeah I agree

150
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,223
That's the trying to do too much I think

151
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
The fridge

152
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
They had in a washing machines that would

153
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,623
Give me notifications when the washing machine is done your laundry is ready to be

154
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
Put in the dryer were folded in

155
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,719
How do I set notifications

156
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
We kind of joke

157
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,327
Inside will buy a new washer and dryer but really that's

158
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
What's happening

159
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
So yes

160
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Defiance

161
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
Space

162
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
I'm just going to say are you guys ready

163
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
Need to have a range hood

164
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
It has a

165
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,567
Screen init or some sort of crazy a i in it

166
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
Mge

167
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
Appliances

168
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
Which is now actually owned by higher

169
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
The Chinese company

170
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
They were showing off and I see

171
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
4-H

172
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
7 inch

173
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
Touchscreen beautiful things

174
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
Is part of your downdraft

175
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
We are still

176
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,767
And I mean it's like the Hub of your kitchen it shows recipes

177
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
It doesn't lie

178
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
But I don't

179
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
Feel like I do this

180
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
It's crazy expensive

181
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
Bosch also

182
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,519
Nothing much smaller than that but also did have

183
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
Screen functionality

184
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,847
Holiday in intelligence associated with

185
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
What are those things called

186
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
When I don't know

187
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,783
No no it's the thing that comes over this

188
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
Stove in like sucks all the bad Arrow

189
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
Fan

190
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
Yeah okay

191
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
Anyway

192
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
So I was running around

193
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
Like looking at some of the smarter kitchen

194
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
Haier washer

195
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
Against

196
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
Same thing what is

197
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,911
Become very clear though is you will not be able to buy a device

198
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
Connected to the internet

199
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
The fridge

200
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
Probably even a dishwasher

201
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,103
Definitely an oven or stove and probably a wash

202
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
So your major appliances

203
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,991
Does are going to be connected and when I didn't hear anyone talk about what I asked about

204
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
Was like how the heck they plan

205
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,087
Sporty's and how long they plan to support these

206
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
Because it's

207
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
Cyber security risk

208
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
And please

209
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
Some of these are built on like

210
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,559
They're not built on Android things anymore they used to be built under like Android tablet

211
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
It was like scary as all hell

212
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
I don't know what feels risky

213
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
Elsa

214
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,959
Maybe not as

215
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
How much value

216
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Send a lot of money on

217
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
I would say

218
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
Honestly

219
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
Team here has been disappointment

220
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
I've been looking

221
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,783
For like really cool things in Granite were only a day in

222
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
Days Inn

223
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
I'm not seeing anything this like

224
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
Future technology

225
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,815
I would agree and we said last year how you saw Madame a

226
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,863
Google home everywhere

227
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
But this year it's actually

228
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
There are more

229
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,263
Mentions are products with those Integrations than

230
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
There are we

231
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Without those ID

232
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,567
Integrations

233
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
So it's even more than last year

234
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
In a lot of wacky stuff

235
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
I don't know technology companies trying to like

236
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,551
Add smart or something to

237
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
Sleep

238
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
And

239
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
We must address

240
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,463
Which is the color

241
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,535
Smart toilet that has mattamy built

242
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
Intuit

243
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
And I like Poler stuff

244
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
They have a powered faucet they have

245
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,239
You that are going to let you know have lighting

246
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
Recipes for your bath

247
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
Routine

248
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,127
But I don't know. I don't think I need toilet what about you

249
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
I certainly do not

250
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
And

251
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
What you could do and I saw this at the color connect

252
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
Today

253
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
They do have

254
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
A voice integration

255
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
In their mirrors now

256
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
So That's Amore

257
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
Replace I think for it

258
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,791
I don't need you know my personal information about my toilet going

259
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
You don't want Amazon I don't particularly care

260
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
My privacy

261
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,239
But most people

262
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,055
Probably don't want to hey he just did a number two

263
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,615
I think you need a little more toilet paper

264
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Yeah

265
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,175
So I like what colors doing

266
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
On the Kinect stuff

267
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
With the

268
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
Faucets

269
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,831
Shower seems we're going to customize shower routines

270
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,391
Thanks for individuals you know they menstruate

271
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,439
But I don't think it needs to be in a toilet I like

272
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,463
The mirror

273
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
I'm looking at that

274
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
That's not my intent

275
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,375
Actually smart mirrors here mostly from smaller companies and then things like color

276
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,935
So what are you looking for in a smart mirror

277
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
I'm just curious because

278
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,519
I feel so obvious but then I'm like

279
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
Wait a second do I really need that

280
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:22,431
I have a Google home in the bathroom I talk to it all the time and it gives me a lot of information I would

281
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
In the mirror

282
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
I think that would be redundant then

283
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
I think most

284
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
People do not have

285
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
Like a home hub in the bathroom

286
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
No screens

287
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
In the bathroom

288
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,927
Sorry it's not a home hub it's a mini

289
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,255
It's a Google mini so there's no screens but I mean I asked

290
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
My calendar I asked you

291
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
The news

292
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
I guess I can play the

293
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
Play videos

294
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
In the news right now

295
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,007
Smart mirror in my bathroom but

296
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,823
Yeah there's something about having the visuals

297
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,383
When you ask for information like what's the weather today

298
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
You don't just get

299
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,943
Hear what today is happening

300
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
A visual hour-by-hour perhaps

301
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
Cloud with

302
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Little raindrop

303
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
Important to

304
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,927
Or vector with his little eyes crying

305
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
Cuz it's raining

306
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,023
Oh and let's bring this up because Kevin

307
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,583
Haven't managed to find the only

308
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
Possibly madhumeh powered robot in the whole place

309
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
And he is very excited and happy

310
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
And I am

311
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Not

312
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
Super excited

313
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
What is this product and why are you excited about it

314
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
Alright the robot's name is Timmy

315
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,663
If the company is rowboats Hemi

316
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:31,807
It's a $1,500 robot companion robot only obviously more expensive

317
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
Repeat all

318
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
Shut up

319
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
Really nice high resolution

320
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Display

321
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
Hilton Fallsview

322
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Camera

323
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,071
Since you can use it for video conferencing you can use it for getting information

324
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
But they have announced that they are

325
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Landing

326
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
I didn't do it yet they're planning

327
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
The coming month

328
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
Amazon announced

329
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
So I think that's going to happen

330
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
What is 15

331
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
$100 so I don't know

332
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,687
Icing on the cake

333
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
Behind Chinese

334
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
Robotic had there's a place

335
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
Temperature Conan Wireless

336
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,087
Does your phone battery last for 8 hours

337
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Did you know that

338
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
My house

339
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,999
I'm sure it will be a very fulfilled and happy robot Kevin

340
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
Happy divorce

341
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
Fraternity

342
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
Kevin

343
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
What is $1,500 robot

344
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
It's not even

345
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
In other anime

346
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
We had

347
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
A bunch of products

348
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Just come out

349
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
They can be controlled by Maddow

350
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,663
Leviton Boeing

351
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
Blah blah blah

352
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,247
More interesting Lee was I

353
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,831
Yeah launch their new smart roller blinds

354
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
Control through matinee

355
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
I saw these acts

356
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
Ashley backlash

357
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
Spring I think when I was in

358
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
Whenever I visited Ikea I got to

359
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,583
And they're pretty cool

360
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
Enterprise points

361
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887
Pretty

362
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
Cheap I don't know do you

363
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,703
Did Ikea

364
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
I didn't see

365
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
Pricing but I

366
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
No

367
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
They they are fairly the pricing they gave me

368
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
It was pretty cheap

369
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
So let's see

370
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,015
Other than that

371
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
You know there's a lot of

372
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
One-off little device

373
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,879
Isis there was a lot of stuff with the Amazon

374
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
An automotive

375
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
So ties in with

376
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
Pioneer

377
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
Electra bed

378
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,047
Some other companies I'm still waiting for Miami

379
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Nissan auto device

380
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
Actually

381
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,655
Really and it's interesting because today

382
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,447
Google also announced to

383
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,775
New our Hardware Partners JBLM

384
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Anker

385
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
So basically you plug this into your

386
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
Cigarette lighter

387
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895
And then it was

388
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Actually let's

389
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
SU

390
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
Connect your phone to your car and it

391
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Has its own

392
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Canceling

393
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Microphone

394
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
To make it better for your input

395
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
In the car so

396
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
I don't know pricing on those they were

397
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
Turn off today but

398
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,767
Yeah they want in the car as well

399
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
In addition

400
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
Amazon there was actually one kind of peace

401
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,399
Snooze that I thought was really interesting is that Chamberlain

402
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
When is working with them to bring

403
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,239
MyQ garage door ecosystem

404
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,311
For Amazon Prime members now you can have your package

405
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
Is delivered through Amazon

406
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Key Program to your garage

407
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,943
Which I was like all there for that

408
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Amazon key

409
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,039
Amazon people in my home no Amazon people in my garage

410
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
I don't know Kevin

411
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
Yeah that makes more sense

412
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,415
Wouldn't work for me because we leave the

413
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
Inside door opener

414
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
Unlock rather

415
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,767
But

416
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Open and close at

417
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
No that's okay I just

418
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,911
I locked myself out one too many times I just leave it unlocked now but

419
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Most people would

420
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,263
Haven't set up where we safer more secure

421
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
And they be comfortable letting Amazon drop

422
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
The packaging

423
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
Garage sales

424
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:40,479
Yeah yeah think about it this way you can put a refrigerator in your garage a lot of people already have something like that

425
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,527
Groceries in crazy stuff

426
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
Oh yeah

427
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
See okay

428
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,415
So that's going to be in 37 cities

429
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,719
And there's not a fee associated with that

430
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,303
Peoples were like Diehard Chamberlain users may be surprised by that because

431
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Cuz they did a

432
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,655
Associated with their if this then that integration

433
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
People were up in

434
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
In arms

435
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,055
I talked to Jeff Meredith who is the president

436
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,847
And CEO of Chamberlain about this

437
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,407
And he said that they are evaluating their

438
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,711
A strategy and they don't think they're going to do that going

439
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Forward

440
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
I don't know what's going to happen

441
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
Maybe you want

442
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
See that happening

443
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
I hope not because most people use

444
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
If services

445
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,487
Free so they add on

446
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,071
People the wrong way and I understand that

447
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,143
Should go back the other way to free but it's up to them

448
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
Does it cost money for companies to act

449
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
Their services

450
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
Those are not free

451
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,055
They're free for us but

452
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
What is subsidized

453
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Survivor

454
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Iherb

455
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
Cheap small news item

456
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
Consider worth talking

457
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,015
About let's see D-Link has

458
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
Outdoor

459
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Outlet

460
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,855
That's going to be about

461
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
P44 rated

462
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
So not the best

463
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
Best version of that but it is a Wi-Fi outdoor

464
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
Do you want an ip64 rated which means you can drop it

465
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
You would actually

466
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
Go with the new tp-link

467
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Casa

468
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
Lineup they actually are

469
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
Launch in outdoor rated

470
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
IPC

471
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
64 version

472
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
Apple WiFi Outlet

473
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
That's pretty sweet

474
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
They

475
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,247
Tp-link guys are actually putting in a whole bunch of new Prada

476
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
Ismart Camera

477
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Outlets

478
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
A bunch of stuff and they're actually going to create some

479
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
Smart AI

480
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
We're going to be trying that one

481
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,999
Later

482
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,815
So one other thing that I really like

483
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,887
Because I want to get rid of devices and boxes in my house

484
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,935
And I'm not saying I'm going to replace all this

485
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
However

486
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
I was very impressed by the

487
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,311
The First Alert onelink smoke detectors that

488
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Have

489
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Mesh Network

490
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,687
So there is smoke detector carbon monoxide detector

491
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,991
They have matinee built-ins they don't like it

492
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,295
Speaker so now that you can play music on them

493
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,855
There's a Google Assistant model in the works

494
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,647
Unfortunately it sounds like you're going to have to

495
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Choose

496
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
Dubai V matinee version

497
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
Google Assistant version

498
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
They're working on it

499
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,863
There's no pricing yet I know the current model without mesh Network

500
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
Is 249

501
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,983
So my guess is you're looking at least $300

502
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
War

503
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
These things however

504
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
These are your

505
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
Wi-Fi

506
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,663
Access points throughout your house they get rid of all the other

507
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,223
Devices that you know you smart speakers

508
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
What's your

509
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
Best access point

510
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
So you're free up a lot of outlets

511
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Everything is big

512
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,695
Best networking threats your house that's a bonus

513
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
They're smart in the sense that

514
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
Detect some issue it knows

515
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
Roommates and just like when you set up

516
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
Lights in particular room in your Smart Hub

517
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,215
Anakin say hey there's a fire in your office or whatever

518
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
I'm sorry it is too or

519
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
$300

520
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,151
Weather for 249 without the mess right now

521
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
So 249 without them

522
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
I have at least

523
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
10 smoke detector

524
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:01,183
In my house replace the mall you can have a very capable mesh network with just maybe 2 or 3 days

525
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
I don't think so Kevin

526
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
Let's see what else do

527
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
Solutran

528
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
ISmart

529
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
Fan control switch

530
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
This is

531
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Nice

532
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,311
Because it controls your fan all

533
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,591
Different speed element

534
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
We get a lot of requests

535
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
For this

536
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
Most people want Wi-Fi

537
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
And not like the Lutron

538
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
Proprietary but if you have

539
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
I said

540
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
It'll be lovely

541
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
Try to think of what else

542
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,903
OGE actually has a new

543
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Switch

544
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
It is a wife

545
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Lots of people are

546
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
Sick of having hub

547
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
Which Kevin and I will

548
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
Delivery with Kevin

549
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887
Like waving his hands like

550
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Yes yes

551
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
I'm not sick of having

552
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,543
I kind of gave in wave the white flag and said I guess I'll die

553
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
Cuz you're dying a slow painful death

554
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
That you wouldn't believe that if you went past

555
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,735
Boots like I did today there lots of lots of products there

556
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
Manufacturers are

557
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,063
They're starting to move forward

558
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

559
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
Send natively work with

560
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,183
The digital assistants so that way there's

561
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,511
Ange's new CEO

562
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
So those

563
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Work with

564
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
Bluetooth

565
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,703
The Google home

566
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,519
And they're $30 for your regular ball than

567
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
44 Eur

568
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,639
BR30 bright

569
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
It's a little bit expensive but

570
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
You know

571
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,015
I'm thinking about do I just pull the plug on my way

572
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,575
Now cuz I don't really use too many sensors

573
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
So

574
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
Igo hubless

575
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Oh my God

576
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
I cannot go homeless

577
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,279
Mistake 4 and all my holiday lighting is on a Z-Wave outdoor

578
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Switch

579
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
But now with all the wifi options

580
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
The D-League option

581
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
Tp-link options

582
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,007
You could actually do this in a lot of people are just now getting into the Smart Hub

583
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
Probably not though

584
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
People think they're pretty people out there who are

585
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
Wifiby

586
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,223
And we saw it mean if I'm going to pick trends

587
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
For the show that

588
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Definitely

589
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
Oh my God why fire

590
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
Do not give me anything weird

591
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Newsies

592
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,183
Death of the Hub is what it seems like

593
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,231
Alright so we're killing the Hub

594
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,535
We're going to call at CES 2019

595
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,167
Yeah I've given Kevin a moment cuz I say any words

596
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
Is it like a eulogy for the Hub

597
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
I'll miss my hub

598
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
Because there are a lot of autumn

599
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
Instead I set up there

600
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
That

601
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103
Especially with sensors

602
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
You know what's going to happen

603
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
They're still motion

604
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Panthers and

605
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
Door sensors

606
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,271
My garage door sensor

607
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
Z-Wave or zigbee

608
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
Mike reebals

609
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,623
You know Kevin is

610
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,695
Assuming the Hub right now to bring it back

611
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,023
I will say I ran into two sensors Bluetooth based on sir

612
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
From Rubio

613
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631
I'm going to try to get

614
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,679
Review units for those to see how long they last

615
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
Loose you didn't know

616
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
Improvement

617
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,311
And also

618
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Profiles

619
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Smart Home

620
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
Going to start doing is

621
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,223
It done profiles for lighting

622
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Forever

623
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,087
But as the expenditure more and more types of

624
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
The devices are trying to build

625
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,719
Easier to like Herman what they are and how they

626
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
Sew in

627
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,047
2019-2020

628
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
Start seeing that

629
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
A different

630
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
In the number

631
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
Hang out there

632
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,007
About protocols and stuff

633
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
We'll talk about

634
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
Hey guess what

635
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
Read Macbeth.

636
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
If you listen to us

637
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,175
Episode

638
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
Is the third year that

639
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,503
We've heard about the bread

640
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,295
Alliance pushing.

641
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
Uniform stand

642
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,671
Dbrand

643
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,463
We're just still here on that

644
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,743
We're not going to see those products

645
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
Yeah we've been

646
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,327
Is third time around now

647
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,399
Are waiting waiting waiting so I don't understand what's happening there

648
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,239
Your interoperability is coming from Amazon Echo or Google home right now

649
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
That is

650
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
The reality that

651
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
Scene in the show

652
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,847
Baidu

653
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
I didn't

654
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,455
A lot of really cool tack but I did like

655
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
Bosch

656
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
He AI

657
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
Which is

658
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
Sims 4 projections

659
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
And it's basically a

660
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Projector is it is

661
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
Display you mount it underneath a cabinet

662
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,024
Kitchen in a project

663
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Videos

664
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
It can

665
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
Play

666
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,472
That she could even estimate the weight of things like

667
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
Which I thought was

668
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Crazy

669
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,056
Can identify food

670
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,872
It's very much designed right now

671
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,944
I've long thought the smart

672
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
Needed a flexible

673
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,760
Screen option

674
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,344
So I'm kind of excited by this but a lot of other

675
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
It's not going to work

676
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,976
Well I don't know what the cost is so that could be an issue

677
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,536
Flexible screens aren't she be there so

678
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,840
I think in the kitchen right now you're looking at a small

679
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,864
Smart display

680
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
And inexpensive

681
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,216
Having a smart display

682
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,776
I don't know the price and it's going to come out

683
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
In China

684
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,592
In March is what

685
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,360
She saying

686
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
And in the US

687
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
You know

688
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,480
Buy flexible I mean more like I could

689
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
Projected

690
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
Anywhere

691
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,296
And I could interact with it is

692
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,344
Supposed to flexible light foldable

693
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
Which I'm sure they're both

694
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Prince here at CES

695
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,488
What would I do like about it was that you could interact

696
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
Little bit

697
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Interesting Lee

698
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,376
Like so like there was a demo where they shooting

699
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,448
Or actually they showed a demo of like

700
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
Ikaw you're like

701
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
Which part of the cow are you

702
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
Are you wanting to eat

703
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
Depressed it was a diagram

704
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,664
Are you press it and it would talk to you about how to

705
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:45,760
Rapper take care of that state while you have your state next to you

706
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,832
I don't want to see like a picture of a real cow

707
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
Bambi was a deer

708
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
But still

709
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:58,816
I like the thing I like the projection on the cake where you have a slider under the cake

710
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840
And you can say I want

711
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,864
Taking this many

712
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
Pieces

713
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,680
And you would slide and the protector

714
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,472
That was awesome

715
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
Exact

716
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
Silver $300

717
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:15,200
I would not cuz I don't need a lot of cake well you can also instead of a screen that you have

718
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,480
In your kitchen

719
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
It's not

720
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
I mean if you bet

721
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
Sticky hands

722
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
Does it matter

723
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
Satanic like a smart

724
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
Display the

725
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Turn

726
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:29,536
You need it I don't know I'm kind of one of those little hand sanitizer so I don't have to

727
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
What does SUS mean

728
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,144
Alright Kevin clearly doesn't

729
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,728
I'm like at some point in time you have to get hands and you just need to get

730
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
Why don't eat ribs or corn on the cob

731
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,872
Summers where the food okay

732
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
That's distressing

733
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,176
We find out if

734
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Fiesta

735
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
Alright let's see

736
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
Before we end

737
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,040
What other things

738
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Do we think

739
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,344
We're worth noting

740
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
Iowa

741
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,952
Through until smooth it was a lot of 5G I should tell everybody

742
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
If you're into 5G

743
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,512
Place to be

744
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
So much

745
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,144
Surprising again that's that I'm like nothing

746
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
Super Innovative and I was really

747
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
If you want to fix

748
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,800
She be great if you want to connect an appliance

749
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,824
Also fine

750
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,640
ACV with

751
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,688
Very little for cake

752
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,784
Yet we were in one of those Cycles right now right you have

753
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,856
Something that really moves the needle and for a couple years

754
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
Add apps

755
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
Does whatever that new

756
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
Today is

757
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,000
But now we're next like love

758
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,048
Smart speakers digital assistants

759
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
WhatsApp

760
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,888
Connectivity everything and we're just riding the wave

761
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
The next big thing

762
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
Alright so

763
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,008
My prediction for the next big thing

764
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
Interfaces

765
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
How about

766
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,920
Interfaces that are like embedded in your ears and on your eyeballs

767
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:50,944
Not your eyeballs

768
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
Kevin and I tribe

00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
My big thing

772
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
You know I'm not going to

773
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Surprise you

Companions robot assistance

775
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,768
I just look at my eye roll here

776
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,304
Visible or Audible

777
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,096
Gyro

778
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
She loved

779
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,192
What's my Vector I send her videos of vector doing all kinds of cool thing

780
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,472
And she loves every single one of them

781
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,776
First of all

782
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
Alright so

783
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,408
We got a mind let's take a moment to go to the Internet of Things podcast

784
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432

Smarter home

787
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
Start with slave

788
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
And by the way we did

789
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,464
CSA Wi-Fi powered sled lock which is a first

790
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,536
And pretty significant for anybody who doesn't want to deal with

791
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,816
Bluetooth CD or

792
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,864
So all of that

793
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
Is now out there

And we've met

803
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Just answer your question

804
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
Let's get to this

805
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Question

806
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
Which is

807
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Scrum

808
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
Josh

809
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Hi Kevin

810
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,184
Joshua Castillo

811
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,208
Minnesota

812
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,256
Love the podcast appreciate all the info

813
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,024
Operation

814
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
My question is about

815
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,840
The far-field Mike's

816
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,888
Christian Amazon Echo

817
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,216
A Google home wondering why they don't just put those in

818
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Phone

819
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:22,592
Turn your phone into basically a portable echo or

820
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
Google home

821
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:28,224
I like to just be able to go wherever I am take my phone out of my pocket put it on the on the table and

822
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:33,344
I got my assistant right there so why can't they are why don't they put those far-field Mike's

823
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
Answer the phone

824
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
That's a great

825
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
Question.

826
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
Because of the Samsung press event

827
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,584
Their new smart TV remotes that have

828
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
Fairfield Metro

829
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:49,728
And that's awesome because instead of having the remote in your hand or needing to

830
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,520
You can be anywhere in the room right now

831
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
Centerview

832
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
Living room

833
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
Frontier TV

834
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,128
You can just talk to it

835
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
Her phone so

836
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,224
That's probably not a typical use case

837
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,272
And I don't think the phone manufacturer

838
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,064
We Care About That Bass

839
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
Good microphone

840
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
In there for phone calls and

841
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
Salon

842
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,720
Not so much for voice assistants so

843
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
I don't think it's going to happen

844
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:18,144
But I don't think so it's not a typical use case because you always have your phone with you yes

845
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,192
You may put it down and walk away from it

846
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,496
And therefore you need a far field microphone but

847
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,800
That's not the use case that most

848
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
Ace Hardware

849
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
Manufacturers of phones

850
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,408
Think about so I don't think it's going to happen

851
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
We'll see but that's

852
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,712
I know why they don't have it

853
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Okay

854
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
That's it

855
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,296
You guys have a question for us

856
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320

623-7424

859
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:46,048
Stay tuned for our interview with Jacob atallah of KB Home talking about how they built

860
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,072
A smart home

861
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,352
Here in Vegas

862
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:55,008
Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor

863
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,824
This week sponsor is fair come a database come

864
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,616
And I have it all.

865
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,688
Oliveira here to talk to us from Farrakhan

866
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
Terracom lunch

867
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,064
Sitri Edge as an iot database back in June

868
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,368
And I'm really curious why does the edge need

869
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
A database

870
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,928
Bus station that's a great question

871
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,000
I guess it's closer related to why I'd Computing at all right

872
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:22,400
My short answer his response time is really a major transits opening different types of

873
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,728
For the market

874
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,408
Effaced a few years ago *

875
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:39,808
04 vs of big data but mostly volume velocity variety

876
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,648
Spencer's at the same time

877
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:50,304
But of course there is the more complex it gets

878
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:03,360
12th Street me all this data to the cloud in order to make this decisions is definitely an all natural way to handle this challenge

879
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
Have several problems

880
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,504
Like the network latency for example the reliability of the connection with the cloud and of course cost

881
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,088
Cloud is not cheap at all I think that's where is Computing really comes into

882
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,416
Houses change the application development

883
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:22,560
Well extracting meaningful information out this date in real time this will certainly require more robust infrastructure

884
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:28,960
Fortification point-of-view especially the edge Computing application

885
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,240
Make it easier to develop

886
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:35,616
And I think you're going to have to talk about what would be such database to definitely see that they certainly needs to

887
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:41,504
Redesign knowing all the constraint like having for a simple with small footprint gateways on the edge have a girl over the frosting

888
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,064
It's very important for this database

889
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,856
Ford flexible data schemas

890
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:52,256
All kinds of different variety of data and different types of sensors everyday

891
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:57,376
Everything definitely needs to be extremely fast that I'm out of data points are produced

892
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:03,776
Buy sensors in real time and buy controllers that you have to control it's absolutely incredible

893
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,824
Complexity of the environment for this application

894
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,616
Did you mentioned other platform

895
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,896
What else

896
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:12,480
Can an edge database do to help make a developer's life easier

897
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,296
Absolutely important because

898
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:20,416
The truth is that the way a application are being developed right now is on top of different types of

899
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,752
What does pacific order in series

900
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:41,152
Usually timestamps for you automatically collecting metadata from the sensors

901
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
Application

902
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:48,064
I think those are all features that an education would benefit from having a database on the edge

903
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,880
Wow that is a lot of information about databases

904
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,208
It's at the edge where can we find out more about this and about Fair

905
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,072
We have actually a great white paper that helps you decide until laxative his privates

906
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,632

915
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
I'm very wealthy

916
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,048
Thank you for having us

917
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
On your podcast

918
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:34,400
I am super excited I hear that you are in

919
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,448
Lovely Vegas which is where

920
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,496
I will be when the show actually airs

921
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,288
And y'all are showing off something

922
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,104
Pretty neat at CES do you want to tell me about it

923
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
We are

924
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Very pleased

925
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,480
To be pulling out the KB Home

926
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Project

927
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
Where tomorrow weed

928
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808

Power cell

930
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,344
The Cask

931
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,160
To explore where the future will be

932
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,976
We strongly believe in innovation

933
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:04,096
And we know that if you want to predict the future the best way to do that

934
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,144
Is to make it yourself

935
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,960
So we're exploring the edges are

936
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,264
Technology and homebuilding back in

937
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,384
Intersection between the two and coming up with a very nice home that will be proud to

938
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,688
Showcase at the crime of Celia

939
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,576
So what this is is a project that is designed to show several things so

940
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
Innovation

941
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
Sustainability

942
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,928
Anson Smart Home

943
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,232
Why don't we start with

944
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:35,584
Probably the sustainability or should we go with Innovation which would you like to start with

945
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,144
What word starts with j something about

946
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,448
Because today in today's environment

947
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,240
Sustainable T is tablespoon

948
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
Everything

949
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,056
Start for us at KB Homes

950
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,896
Starts with a very quality high-quality home that

951
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,712
Is also high-performance home that's where it's at

952
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,760
So every home we produce is

953
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,064
Energy star label at home

954
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
That means

955
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:01,184
Our customers enjoy a home with less utility bills

956
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,280
And more Comfort now with our contact home

957
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
Project

958
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,584
We went beyond that

959
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
So

960
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,680
Here we looked at how can a home be

961
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,960
Energy Independence

962
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,984
Ansel

963
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,008
Went beyond

964
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
Our products

965
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,824
Auction homes to home.

966
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
Is

967
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,616
NetZero

968
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,456
And has battery storage system in it so that it

969
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,504
Can be fully Off the Grid

970
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,904
As much as possible that's where the customer has very little electricity bill to pay

971
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
The same time as the

972
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:37,024
Stability and security of energy storage in their home

973
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,584
In case the grid goes down at anytime

974
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,888
So that some of the sustainability effort

975
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,168
Let's talk about

976
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,960
The construction Innovation that

977
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,240
You guys are experimenting

978
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,776
Because I think that's

979
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:52,384
Really honestly. Maybe more game-changing than anything that you're doing here but

980
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,408
I don't know we'll see

981
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,688
Well there are many

982
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,224
Game changers in the home

983
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
And one of them

984
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,784
Is the

985
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
Outside

986
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,112
Fully integrated fabrication

987
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:05,184
Off the home which took place in a factory

988
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
First

989
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
You start with

990
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
What's called

991
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
Building information

992
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:13,376
Modeling Bim Bim models are very very precise

993
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,704
They also can visually help

994
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
An architect

995
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
See where there are conflicts

996
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800
Between elements of the home

997
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
Address

998
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:25,152
These complex when everything is clear and the pain model

999
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
It's ready

1000
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,968
Then in a factory setting

1001
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,040
CNC machines take over and

1002
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
Just got up all day

1003
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,112
Parts of the house

1004
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:34,880
In terms of

1005
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,416
Wolves wall panels

1006
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,464
Floor panel and

1007
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,744
Not ready for

1008
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,536
Shipping to the site

1009
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,816
We actually took

1010
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,680
Technologies are available today in terms of off-site fabrication

1011
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,704
Step further

1012
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,056
We innovated with the factory to include the insulation

1013
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
At the factory

1014
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
Install it there

1015
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,664
And also the weatherization

1016
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,968
Sheathing from the outside as well

1017
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,248
So the house

1018
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
Came to the side

1019
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,320
With insulation in place

1020
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:09,440
And reduce the amount of Labor needed for insulation on site when the house came on

1021
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,768
Insight that we had a cranberry that pulled up the house

1022
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,584
Today's we have the whole frame

1023
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,376
Structure of the house done

1024
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,912
So from that point on

1025
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:23,008
It was a matter of just finishing up the house the finishes of the house

1026
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,568
The trim and fixtures

1027
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
And

1028
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,968
Not want to be missed are all the iot devices and printers that

1029
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
Reports in the house

1030
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
We will get to those

1031
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,088
And now so prefabrication

1032
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,392
Sustainability are there other

1033
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
Building

1034
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
Technologies that

1035
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,744
You guys explored in this that you should talk about

1036
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
Or that you want to share

1037
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,560
Certainly there are many

1038
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,328
As a

1039
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,608
Said earlier

1040
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
We added

1041
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,168
Insulation in the factory bugged

1042
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,192
Form of therapy

1043
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,960
Insulation

1044
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
Was also very innovative

1045
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
It wasn't

1046
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:59,616
Fiberglass batt insulation and it was not spray foam

1047
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:03,456
Insulation either it was phenolic type of insulation

1048
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
That has

1049
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,760
Double the amount of

1050
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,296
Insulation value

1051
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
Corrine

1052
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
Dan

1053
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,624
Other systems that are on the market

1054
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
It's right now

1055
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,184
It is a technology coming

1056
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
From Europe

1057
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:18,560
That's we adapted here and because it comes in solid panel

1058
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,120
It was easy for us to cut the fence

1059
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,144
Sea machines

1060
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,192
Put them in the wall base

1061
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,008
And have the insulation already done in the house

1062
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,312
That's just one example of several

1063
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,640
Super materials and material innovation

1064
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,200
That we are leveraged in this house

1065
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,272
Oh man I was so excited when I got the spray foam

1066
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,552
Play my house so now there's a

1067
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,112
Insulation R-value

1068
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,672
Gosh all right

1069
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,000
It's better with the spray foam insulation than what you see

1070
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,048
5 years ago

1071
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,072
It is true

1072
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,608
Go technology

1073
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Okay

1074
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,192
Let's talk about some of the other Technologies

1075
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
Putting in the house I promise people

1076
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
Smart home stuff in

1077
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:04,896
I'm sure you will deliver before we go into like specific devices talk to me about how you thought

1078
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
About adding

1079
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,968
Connected devices and smart

1080
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
To this

1081
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,504
Particular home

1082
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,040
What's a seaweed

1083
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
Leverage

1084
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,832
Technology

1085
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,368
To add to the

1086
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,904
Comfort of the home

1087
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,184
The easel

1088
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
Living at home

1089
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,024
The wellness house comes

1090
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
From living in a

1091
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,072
Healthy

1092
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
Well-constructed

1093
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
We wanted

1094
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,680
Technology to serve

1095
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,960
The homeowner

1096
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,752
In meaningful ways

1097
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,032
Beyond where

1098
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,080
Technologies are at right now

1099
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
We started with

1100
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,664
Understanding of what Foundation

1101
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
We want to have in the house

1102
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,480
And we know that

1103
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,504
Intelligent

1104
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
Is very important

1105
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856
We can transcend

1106
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,648
The current automated

1107
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,416
Home

1108
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
Smartphone

1109
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
From

1110
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,744
Simply smart 2

1111
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,536
Smart home or even to think

1112
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,608
Walking home that will do things on behalf of the homeowner

1113
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
Show

1114
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,424
Artificial intelligence

1115
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,448
We got it

1116
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
Trump

1117
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,288
Google we have Google as our platform

1118
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
In the home

1119
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,104
Boston artificial intelligence

1120
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,152
And in mesh Wi-Fi network

1121
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,200
These are two important

1122
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,224
Foundation

1123
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,248
From which

1124
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,296
We built on centers built

1125
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,832
Event wall lighting

1126
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:21,440
Smart appliances that are smart air conditioning thermostat

1127
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,256
System back are very responsive

1128
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,584
To the environment if the home band results was

1129
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,192
We are getting closer to a pinking home that will do things for you

1130
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,752
Okay so there's a lot to unpack there

1131
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,568
And we'll start with this idea of

1132
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,872
Good connectivity makes for a good home

1133
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
Which I totally agree

1134
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,712
Like Yay let's get Wi-Fi everywhere

1135
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,528
How do you build that into a home

1136
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,296
Amica

1137
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
Easy

1138
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,880
For the homeowner so what is the process there

1139
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,928
We started with great partners

1140
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,464
That understood that

1141
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
The systems

1142
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,792
Four of them have to be simple

1143
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,864
And easy to use for the homeowner

1144
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,728
This is how we can give back time to the homeowner not to give them it's very complex

1145
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,544
The truth of the matter is

1146
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,640
That the home of the future could have awkward

1147
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,944
75 Wi-Fi device

1148
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,480
And may have

1149
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,784
Advocated mesh Network

1150
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
Show

1151
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,600
It's not that easy

1152
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,928
Going forward then I think we all still need to innovate

1153
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:29,536
Little bit more towards an easier system to manage

1154
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:33,632
I would say Google did a great thing in October

1155
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,424
2018 when they

1156
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,216
Revamp the Google home

1157
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,288
Which now incorporates all the

1158
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,080
We don't have to go to

1159
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
20 different apps

1160
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,640
Open your

1161
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,432
Doron look at the light

1162
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,736
Other things it's all in

1163
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
In one app

1164
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,784
Within the Google home

1165
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,088
So it's Innovations like that then

1166
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
Will make it

1167
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,160
Easier in the future for customers

1168
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:00,768
The Google mesh network is also very user-friendly you don't have

1169
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,072
To worry about a lot of IP address

1170
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
Seven Salon

1171
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
Lot of it

1172
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,448
Ask away from the consumer so that

1173
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:12,800
You just have to enjoy I got a new item I can plug it

1174
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,616
Into the network and it will join the network Tennessee

1175
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
I think

1176
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:22,784
Innovations come from many parts but we still have some room to improve in that area going forward

1177
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,880
Let's talk about things like having sensors built into the walls

1178
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,672
Thermostats and that sort of thing

1179
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,488
Even just a few moments ago we were talking about installation

1180
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,536
Technology has changed so much

1181
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560
5 years

1182
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,632
So that's something I probably wouldn't mess with

1183
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:41,472
Because you know you're not going to open up the walls of your home for a while hopefully

1184
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:47,360
But how do you think about building in technology which tends to have a much shorter life cycle than traditional building

1185
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
There's no better time

1186
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
Built-in

1187
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,712
Technology

1188
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,528
Then when you're starting from a blank canvas

1189
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,808
It's easier

1190
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,344
Include items

1191
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,904
Built into the wall but to your point

1192
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,696
Even these sensors

1193
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,744
May be surpassed in

1194
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,072
Few years so the Innovation that we did

1195
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,608
2

1196
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Put them

1197
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,912
In junction box

1198
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,216
And so you can I park RV

1199
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,288
We passed to each juncture box

1200
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,688
Cat5 cable and just in case if that particular sensor or are you

1201
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,736
Device is not Wi-Fi

1202
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,784
It will have available to it

1203
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,576
The cable if we need to use

1204
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,136
When you create it

1205
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,440
Provided with power and will

1206
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
Communication

1207
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
Caribou

1208
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
Is future proof

1209
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,048
To the best

1210
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
Know-how at this time

1211
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,376
What we have in them

1212
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,936
Right now are indoor air quality

1213
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,264
And then you put a cover plate on that juncture bar

1214
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:51,616
Women slap in the cover plate so that the air quality

1215
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:57,759
Dissenters can continue to sample the air in the house and passively in the background

1216
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,295
Would be able to

1217
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
Say okay

1218
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,599
This room

1219
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,647
Perhaps they tried something

1220
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,439
And that kitchen this will mean

1221
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,975
More air at this time

1222
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:12,607
And if then sends a signal to the air conditioning system which is zoom we have

1223
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,679
Glow Housewives

1224
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:18,239
Signal to the air conditioning system where

1225
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,567
This is considered pump no fresh air into that zone

1226
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:25,151
So that's just one example of built-in iot

1227
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
And how we might

1228
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,479
Keep them to keep the house youku

1229
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,503
For the future

1230
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,319
So let's say I purchase this home

1231
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,623
How do I get it set up to work with

1232
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,439
My family and then who do I call if in

1233
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,975
Six or seven months

1234
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,767
I don't know something breaks or I get

1235
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:44,607
Confused her I'd like to set up a movie timer

1236
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,167
More

1237
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,703
Sophisticated

1238
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
To the extent that

1239
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:55,359
We would anytime KB Home build a relationship with our customers we always wanted

1240
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,151
To be a Wonderful World

1241
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,711
A wonderful experience for our customers

1242
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,527
10 KB Home has

1243
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,807
Collaboration

1244
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,855
Dish smart home services

1245
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,927
Using the same network that dish satellite

1246
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:14,047
TV entertainment have on the country they have teams that are specialized

1247
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:19,423
And smart home services and we work with them to give our customers at this time

1248
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,751
So initially after a homeowner movies in

1249
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,775
We asked them

1250
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
To call

1251
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,103
Dish smart home services

1252
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,639
And ask them to come in

1253
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,431
At the convenience of the customer

1254
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,967
They come in to help them

1255
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735
Get up there

1256
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,063
The Nest hello doorbell at the front door

1257
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
The house

1258
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
And the thermostat from

1259
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
Carrier and mesh

1260
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,951
Wi-Fi network from goo

1261
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,231
Panda

1262
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,767
Speakers that Google home

1263
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
Speakers

1264
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,071
So they come in

1265
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,887
And Ben couple hours with the customer

1266
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,703
In my estimation if the customer was going to do this

1267
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,983
All on their own

1268
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,543
Digression the weekend

1269
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:02,687
Want to do it no and we prefer it based on the kind of relationships we want to have with our customers

1270
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
That it is done

1271
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:08,831
At the convenience of the customer and within a couple hours the couple hours are taken

1272
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,855
2 /

1273
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:14,207
Shut off the network and connect all the items to it do

1274
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
Show the customer house

1275
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,303
And then

1276
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,839
Leave them with

1277
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,911
Information where they can call for the next 6 months

1278
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
They can call and get

1279
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:30,335
Support either online or by phone on any other device that bring to the home

1280
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,639
Say if they going they buy a new

1281
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:37,247
TV that has Chromecast built into it and they bring it to him and they want to connect

1282
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,295
To the network they can get support

1283
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,575
To do any of these

1284
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
Additional iot item

1285
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,391
Around the house

1286
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,159
Got it

1287
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,487
Okay and let's talk about how this fits in with

1288
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,535
KB Home and it's

1289
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,815
Plans going forward

1290
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,351
So there is Ben

1291
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
Probably for the last

1292
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,447
10 years or so efforts in the Home Building community

1293
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,471
To provide

1294
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,495
Services

1295
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,519
Is after the sale

1296
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,591
So this might be warranties this might be

1297
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,615
Pest detection

1298
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,943
How is something like this new KB Home Project

1299
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,967
Fit within that

1300
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,503
I guess additional Revenue

1301
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,807
I think the future

1302
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,831
May hold

1303
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,855
Room for

1304
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
Somebody

1305
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,903
That can

1306
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,439
Continue to provide service

1307
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
As for the home

1308
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
It could be in

1309
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
Different areas

1310
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,047
Whether it is

1311
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,071
The digital

1312
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,119
Smart home area or in

1313
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,423
And the Health and Wellness Water

1314
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,983
Purification air filters

1315
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,287
There is room for that

1316
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,359
And I think some business models are evolve

1317
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,711
So

1318
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:44,063
From our perspective at KB for this particular house

1319
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:44,831
It does

1320
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:48,927
Have health and wellness system with air purification

1321
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:55,327
Water purification systems in it as well and these things do need the filters changed over time

1322
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,423
Whether we leave it to the customer if they are very much do it

1323
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,263
Myself type of person then they can do it themselves

1324
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,103
Ordering the filters or it can be a service provided

1325
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,199
To come in and change the filters air and water filters for them

1326
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,479
Regular base

1327
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:17,855
Is that the app will continue to remind them when that mean

1328
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,623
To happen

1329
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,159
So if they do it then

1330
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,743
They still have some reminders

1331
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,583
Got it in the app is the generic Google hours of KB Home

1332
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:35,007
Darwin Wellness intelligence application or system and an application related to it

1333
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,287
It controls

1334
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:42,175
Indoor air quality sensors that I mentioned earlier but it's also controls lighting

1335
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,247
Filtration purification system

1336
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,063
For the house as well the water and the air

1337
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,343
And then of course

1338
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,623
Can allow you to

1339
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,231
The system also can passively

1340
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,255
Do the lights

1341
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
According

1342
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,303
True that hour of

1343
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,839
And according to

1344
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,375
Perhaps some precepts

1345
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,703
So that's how the Darwin

1346
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
System works

1347
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,519
And it's app is

1348
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,847
We be a front interface use it if you'd like

1349
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:17,503
But if you leave it alone the house will still be maintained in a nice way for a healthy wellness way

1350
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,527
Because of the

1351
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,063
Precepts in the system

1352
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,879
Okay so in addition to this home.

1353
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,159
Prefabricated

1354
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,767
As part of the building materials you also have made it flexible

1355
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,303
Imus modular inside

1356
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,583
Can you talk a little bit about that

1357
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,423
ACS we did that we designed a home that can

1358
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:38,239
Flex with the life stages of the homo

1359
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,543
Trust me it's a two-story home

1360
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,311
With

1361
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,103
Secondary bedrooms upstairs

1362
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,151
That can be used by the

1363
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:48,991
Homeowner if they have children or boomeranging

1364
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,039
Children and Swan however

1365
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:54,623
At their later life stages where they may not need that

1366
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,439
They could separate the first floor from second

1367
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:03,839
Very easily because we already built the entrance to the second floor that too independent and a way to separate

1368
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,863
2 floors

1369
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,399
So they can separate them

1370
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,799
For the rental or for a caregiver to be in the Upper Floor and have full

1371
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,103
Units of their for their private use

1372
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,151
At the same time we built

1373
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,711
On the first floor flexible wall

1374
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,807
Moves via electricity and a motor

1375
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,575
It moves

1376
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:29,439
Forwards and backwards into a space that were calling a flex space

1377
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:35,071
When the wall is all the way to the outside of that Flex space

1378
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,631
That room can be a bedroom

1379
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,655
Or an office

1380
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,935
And it

1381
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:43,007
Even has wall bed that comes down and

1382
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,871
Certainly becomes a bedroom and it has a built-in desk as well for

1383
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
An office

1384
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,175
When the wall is

1385
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,455
All the way back

1386
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
Internet speed

1387
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:57,343
It gives a space over to the great room so if you have

1388
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,951
40 you have family over you are using more of that

1389
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,743
Room for the open

1390
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:07,327
Room that makes the great space and is the place to socialize

1391
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,655
Jacob that is a lot I can't wait to see

1392
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
This whole

1393
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
In action

1394
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,983
This is a project home

1395
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:20,383
Is this something that will be available for people on the market or how do you plan to use your learnings from this going forward

1396
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,455
That's certainly this is a contact home we built it to it

1397
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,503
Store work tomorrow

1398
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,319
And to the extent that we experience

1399
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,599
Many things in this

1400
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,927
We know there are some items that we would love

1401
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:39,327
To start bringing into our production home and make it available to our customers very soon Cason

1402
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,375
Is the Darwin

1403
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
Wellness

1404
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
Intelligence

1405
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,471
We're going to be a pilot and get

1406
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,543
10 offering it in certain Market see it through

1407
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,359
Start building on it from a base package

1408
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,639
Growing get going

1409
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,175
The same with

1410
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:59,039
Other Technologies in the home many of them are already offered by a bee home

1411
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,575
Smart appliances

1412
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,135
Many others as well

1413
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,439
So there is a lot that we learn from it

1414
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,231
And we hope to be

1415
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:13,631
Making them more production-oriented and bring them to the Market within months and coming years

1416
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:19,519
Awesome alright will Jacob thank you so much for sharing with us this vision of the future

1417
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,311
One possible home of the few

1418
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,871
Thank you I enjoyed being with you

1419
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,919
