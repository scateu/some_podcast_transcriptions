1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:05,888
Hey everybody this is the Internet of Things podcast in this is Stacey Higginbotham and my co-host

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,168
Kevin tofel

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,752
And we have a wonderful issue for you today

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,288
I am going to talk about lights

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,336
We're going to talk about the Amazon Echo

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,176
We're going to talk about mysterious FCC filings

7
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,992
Dunt Dunt

8
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:21,760
Yeah

9
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:25,344
Oh I guess I should have got a spooky music like

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,672
Still working on sound effects for the show

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,256
No no that's it that's that's all we have

12
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,280
Okay then

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,328
Or maybe that was probably more like a

14
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,096
Wentworth

15
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
Sad trombone

16
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,912
Okay so

17
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,448
Let's get a started with

18
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,240
Oh I don't know what's more exciting

19
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,312
Mysterious SEC filings are brand new Bluetooth lighting

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,896
We talked about letting a lot was talking about the FCC for a minute

21
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
All right

22
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
So

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,224
Kevin you want to kick ass off

24
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
I would love to sew first and foremost we don't know exactly what the FCC has tested

25
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,160
But they have tested something

26
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,232
That would be related to internet of things we think

27
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,072
Thanks to your Dave's that's over that's not funny he noticed

28
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:11,680
A Google filing with the SEC where a device was tested a smart device

29
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,544
We're not sure exactly what it is what do we know we know it has Bluetooth

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,848
And that's it that's all we kind of know

31
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:23,712
In terms of the internal radios and such they seen I spent some time looking at the filing

32
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
Really couldn't

33
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,784
Make too much heads or tails of

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
What does Maybe

35
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,672
Some people are saying it has to do with Google Glass I don't think so at all but

36
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,744
You know because it only has Bluetooth and there was talk of

37
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,072
He label in August for the FCC label

38
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
Touch screen type device

39
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,936
I was actually wondering maybe it's a beacon of some kind

40
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:48,544
That's kind of what I looked at it that's what I thought in that we should explain for those who don't know

41
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:53,408
Well I was going to say we should start with what an easy label is

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,504
And why they are so the FCC has to approve any device out there with a

43
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
Most of you guys probably know that

44
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
But to those of you who don't

45
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
So anything that has a radio

46
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
Has to do with FCC approval because

47
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
Sting's interfere in

48
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
That's bad

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
Assisi Heights

50
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:14,400
Cuz it was bad cuz it's bad when your cell phone doesn't work cuz you got some cheap microwave oven like

51
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
Mess with your signals

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,752
So that's what the FCC approval label in

53
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
You'll find it on

54
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
Everything from Lake toys to

55
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
High-end iot devices

56
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:29,504
I used to have to be used to be either extra on the device to be a paper label but now they have electronic labels where

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,808
The FCC certification IDs and such

58
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
Canby

59
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,880
Sean just like the software version on your phone

60
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,928
Very nice so that's what this is

61
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,280
It's it's fairly new it it was only recently that the SEC I started allowing that

62
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,144
How do you say need a screen for it so it's if you don't have a screen on your device or not to have any label

63
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
So this device has a screen

64
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
See we learn something already

65
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
Most vegans don't have screens

66
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
True let's

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,152
True and and in the testing data there was talk about normal usage

68
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
I've only just

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,344
5 mm between this device and something else so that kind of put the kibosh on the ibeacon thing to exist

70
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
Some degree

71
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,720
So okay so will it first fall will tell people what a beacon is so a beacon

72
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:11,744
Is

73
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,072
It's a device that uses Bluetooth to offer location data

74
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
And it

75
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,144
They basically constantly transmits to your

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
Your phone

77
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,496
And your phone if it has the appropriate app will open up an app

78
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,056
Tied to that Beacon and says something like

79
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,640
Hey you are here and here's what you can do based on the information that you

80
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,176
You're here so I can be like

81
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Historic

82
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
Coupon if you're in my house it could be like

83
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,064
You have access to this liquor cabinet

84
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
Or

85
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
Do you like this

86
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:45,792
Room this temperature and it will share data with the house that says you know there's a person in this room you should turn on lights

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,328
My house is

88
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
Isn't that smart yet but one day it will be

89
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
I'm very excited

90
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
So that's that's kind of the promise and Hope

91
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
The beacons

92
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
But this if it has a screen

93
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,360
Bluetooth Google filed this on April 20th

94
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,432
The Friday before I saw that Samsung filed

95
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
For a Smart Lock with the FCC

96
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
And I got all excited thinking

97
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
Oh my gosh

98
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
Samsung S introducing a Smart Lock

99
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,184
But they were actually doing an nfc-based Smart Lock for the

100
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Small to medium

101
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
It says business and it was actually more like

102
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,559
NFC RFID kind of Base

103
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Listing with a card

104
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
But that is what I learned

105
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
Samsung actually had

106
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
The Samsung home division over

107
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
South Korea four

108
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
Yahoo new

109
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
Yeah probably everybody over himself

110
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:37,503
So what's a nice trip so maybe then this could be a Smart Lock that ties into the holding

111
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,295
Nest Dropcam infrastructure

112
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,879
And set your phone with its Bluetooth unlock Sherlock I don't know

113
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,463
And you would need a screen I mean you wouldn't need a screen but a screen

114
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Might work

115
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
For that

116
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,095
Will fix a touch screen there might be an alternative

117
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:58,495
Method of Entry such as entering a PIN number or something like that

118
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,055
And a lot of people that again keypads

119
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
Very popular way for small business

120
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
Google's actually been cut

121
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
Keenan Smallville

122
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,271
But whatever it is thanks for the FCC testing we know it will be safe

123
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,343
Safe and not interfere with your cell phone

124
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
There's Our Mysterious SC

125
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
Sissy device

126
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
And since we're speaking about Bluetooth

127
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:23,839
We'll talk about lighting we do talk about it a lot but this is the first Bluetooth lighting device that actually tried

128
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,887
It's from a company called ilumi

129
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
And

130
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,239
This just hit the market actually last Wednesday

131
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,847
I was in New York so I didn't get a chance to fully run it through its Paces to talk about it

132
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:40,223
Before last week's show so sorry about that you guys are a week late on this but

133
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
I've been living with these I've had

134
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,623
The two kind of air called a 19 so the normal size light bulbs

135
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
And I had a down Lamp Theater

136
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
Full color

137
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
So full color LED lights

138
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,303
The a19 version the normal light bulb

139
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
Persian is

140
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
89.95

141
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,679
Yowza so 90 bucks they're very heavy

142
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,983
And the

143
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,031
Downlite is about 90 bucks

144
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591
I'm sorry is about 19:9

145
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,383
95 Silverado hundred bucks

146
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:14,271
But they're all Bluetooth so all you need you don't need a hug you just need your phone

147
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,623
But after living with them for almost week I can tell you you

148
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,415
You want more than your phone

149
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
You want a switch

150
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,023
Because the second you run out of Bluetooth range

151
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
You can't do anything with the light

152
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,375
So if you want to turn it off

153
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,423
You got to go walk by the light bulb

154
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
You're not

155
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
At that point in time my God

156
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,799
Why Suburban totally defeats the purpose

157
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,895
Especially if you were like me and you live in a big house with an open floor plan

158
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,711
Cuz you're like looking at the light across the room in your like

159
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,991
I would have turned it off

160
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
I got to go

161
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
I got to get up and go near me

162
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
To turn it off

163
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
That's a lot of dough for

164
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
Limited range light bulb

165
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:58,047
To me but but but I will say this in the video that you took

166
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,655
It was actually kind of cute your dog dancing around underneath the light switch was changing colors

167
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,983
The light colors look pretty intense in my route

168
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,543
They do that they're amazing so the light

169
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,079
Colors are like

170
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,687
The Christmas light quality they're very vibrant the blue is phenomenal

171
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
The white

172
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,015
It's very stark white I wouldn't

173
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,295
Wouldn't recommend that

174
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,135
White what I will say that these guys have got going for them

175
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
It's the software experience

176
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
The more of these

177
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
Alternative lighting

178
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,071
Things that I try the more I realized that Hughes app

179
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Sucks

180
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,935
These so illumi has built

181
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Experiences

182
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
That's what they call it

183
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
And what they've done is

184
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,103
The ones that I've tried that are really interesting

185
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
Are called

186
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
Torch

187
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,711
And this one actually the lights will follow you

188
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,783
Now I only have three tests bulbs but they

189
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
They notice where your phone is

190
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,879
And they light up as you walk through your house

191
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,927
I like that isn't that fun

192
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,023
I'd like that that's like. That's why I want begin to my house and have it all tied together

193
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
Here you don't need that

194
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,607
Pékin because you are your friends The Weeknd

195
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Exactly

196
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
It is fine if you have your phone on you

197
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
If you don't

198
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
It's kind of a bummer

199
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
But

200
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:18,175
So so that was a really cool thing and to enable it all you do is go to the experience section and you literally collect your lights you want in

201
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,711
Can you turn it on and boom

202
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
Again

203
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,551
You run into the problem that we talked about before which is

204
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,391
Your house is a shared environment and your phone is personal to you

205
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,951
But it runs on IOS and Android

206
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
So you can't have you know

207
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,071
Two people having this kind of experience although you're going to have dueling you know

208
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Lights flickering on and off

209
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,655
We didn't put it

210
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,983
In our front porch so that was kind of neat when you come in

211
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,799
You know the front hallway light will come on and you often have

212
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
With you so that's fine

213
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,919
The other experience that I showed with the dog was the Dance Experience

214
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,479
And that thing was up

215
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,807
So it tracks through Spotify on your device

216
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
Or Google Play

217
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
Or iTunes

218
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
On your iPhone

219
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,231
And if you're playing that through your phone speaker

220
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
Or I actually went through a Bluetooth

221
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
A Jambox that I had

222
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
On the bench by my door

223
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
The lights turn

224
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Bright colors and they

225
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
Have different

226
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
Dance mode that is all colors they have

227
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
Cool mode that is cold colors

228
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
In a fire mode that is

229
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Only one color

230
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
And that's pretty

231
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Nice

232
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Very nice

233
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
So those are

234
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Those lights

235
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
And

236
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
So far I'm not sold on

237
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
Unlike on the Wi-Fi better

238
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,047
Well wider range for one thing and then

239
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,119
I like the torch feature I I think the

240
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,447
The mix of having both is going to be kind of fun or just having Deacons

241
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
Better deployed in

242
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Yep

243
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,847
I'm kind of disappointed we haven't seen more

244
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
Pecans for the home

245
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
Implementation

246
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,967
But that's just me me to they're coming

247
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
I'm I'm still waiting for the zoo Lee Outlets

248
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
You know there's the

249
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
The Wally home

250
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
Sensors that are integrated with nest

251
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
But you're right there's

252
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
There's not a lot

253
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,815
Actually out on the market that are tied into other

254
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Nope

255
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,471
Nope nope nope by speaking of Nest there is something to talk about

256
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:22,847
That you actually have you can't use it this way yet but you got an Amazon Echo and we talked about it last week

257
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,967
Wait don't I talk about the Amazon Echo actually you know what you didn't talk about it much

258
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,551
After you did the review from that that time until

259
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
Until just recently when

260
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,671
It came some third-party Integrations we talked about it last week

261
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
What is it

262
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
Right now integrates with

263
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,071
Define exactly

264
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,143
So you've been able to test that which is very cool

265
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,007
But now that Amazon has the SDK out there for these 3rd party invitations

266
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
Absent developer I guess he has Early Access

267
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,919
I'm assuming he's using the official SDK but I don't know for sure

268
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,223
PayPal apps that you can control

269
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,575
Uses Echo to control Smart lights through Corky's wink hub

270
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,159
And he can also control his nest thermostat right through

271
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
The echo

272
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Yes

273
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,767
So I saw that I have a tried it and

274
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,631
I kind of want to although we can't yet cuz he can't publish that dab

275
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,471
Here we're getting into some question

276
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
Okay

277
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,591
I use the Echo app literally every single night both me and here's the

278
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
My husband

279
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
Hello

280
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
That's big

281
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Doesn't use almost

282
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
He uses almost nothing in our house that's

283
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
But

284
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,599
We also I

285
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
I talk to Google

286
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
To shut down my nest

287
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
So

288
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
Make a Google Now

289
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,047
I'm not going to say it

290
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Can you talk to me

291
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
But I actually tell it to

292
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
To turn my Nest down

293
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
If I'm downstairs and I don't want

294
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
So I don't now I'm going to have option

295
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
Do I tell him

296
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
Alexa to do it or do I tell

297
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
My phone to do it

298
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
And I don't know

299
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,039
Cuz my phone is named Charles in my

300
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
My echo was named Alexa so

301
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
It's a job

302
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,951
Bear in mind I'm currently using an iPhone

303
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,535
Because I'm doing some testing of a case with an e ink display in it

304
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
And in the

305
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Google

306
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
Voice command I don't want to say it

307
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,239
On iOS I can't control my nest

308
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,847
So for iOS users who have an echo and a nest

309
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
There you go

310
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
Oh so my husband will be thrilled

311
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
I don't know about that but

312
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,575
He actually he will he's really liking the voice control of all of

313
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,927
The stuff and it is I will say it's super handy like when you're in bed cuz we

314
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
Like I said we have the remote control in bed and

315
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
Okay Alexa

316
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
Make it colder

317
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
She's like

318
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Boom

319
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
I'm really liking her she is

320
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,751
She's becoming my favorite person in the house I'm going to be honest

321
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,823
See now I'm disappointed because I had the invite to order

322
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,431
And I chose not to because there were no Integrations there was no SDK available

323
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
I'm like

324
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:12,831
A hundred bucks I got to wait 6 months for it now shows

325
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,927
You chose poorly lesson learned

326
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,583
No what did I do I got up at 3 in the morning order an Apple Watch that I still don't have report

327
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,655
But it's going to be worth it I hear that the Hue app on the Apple watch

328
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
Is amazing

329
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:34,591
Well I'm looking forward to trying the apps and as a former Android Wear user I still have my Android Wear watch

330
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,431
It's amazing to me that there are over 3000 Apple watch apps on day one

331
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
Where is Android Wear we didn't have that much

332
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,063
And they're very very few apps that control

333
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,367
Home automation systems on Android Wear

334
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
Will actually have to get you some

335
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,719
Home automation devices set up so you can X

336
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Play with that

337
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
When you actually get

338
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
Is that that's it that is a subtweet

339
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,167
To get my insteon system setup again yes

340
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,543
Yes I know I don't think there was anything about it but I think it was that was pretty

341
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,639
So I also wouldn't there there's a few news items that we should

342
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
Talk about

343
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
There's a company called scanadu

344
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Which

345
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Makes a

346
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
Tricorder

347
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Guys

348
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
That's why rings

349
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
Is it

350
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,999
Oh my gosh it's Star Trek that has this tricorder right very good thing that you got that correct all the Star Wars

351
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Bands of the all over your face

352
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:30,655
Sueldo I knew it wasn't Star Wars cuz I'm trying to picture the Star Wars people

353
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
I see a doctor McCoy

354
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Edwin

355
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:39,103
So these guys make the tricorder is a hockey puck size device

356
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,687
You stick it up to your forehead for about 30 seconds

357
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,735
It measures five vital signs

358
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
Measure heart rate

359
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,575
Respiration blood oxygenation

360
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
Blood pressure

361
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:56,255
And one other item I cannot recall right now but I thought that was pretty good that I got four out of five

362
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
The other items really important

363
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,399
And they said that to your phone and it is

364
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:07,775
Is going up for FDA approval sometime at the end of this year and by next year it should be out in the market

365
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,359
About 8000 people currently have one because they had a

366
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
Indiegogo campaign

367
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,967
Last snow in 2013

368
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
So those people

369
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,295
Their devices shipped to them last year

370
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
Their data

371
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Was actually the kind of

372
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
The day today

373
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
Submitted that will be submitted to the f

374
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,767
So scanadu that company raise 35 million

375
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
And they kind of did an update

376
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:35,423
It said by the way y'all next year the device is going to be out

377
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,215
With FDA approval

378
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
And going to cost

379
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
$199

380
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
Not bad

381
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Which

382
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
That's reasonable to me

383
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
That's

384
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,711
Oh you know what the third item is

385
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
Stress

386
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
Temperature

387
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
Hello

388
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Has taken again

389
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,903
Temperature we're just talking about the mess

390
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,207
There you go

391
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Not that.

392
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
So

393
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,839
I'm really I am really excited about

394
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
Both as a person

395
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,775
Who has kind of Sam Lackey blood pressure things going on but also because I'm a parent and

396
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Mostly because I

397
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
Blood pressure issue

398
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Cosmo

399
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
So I'm really excited about like monitor

400
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,503
And I think you should be much as you but

401
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
The collective you because

402
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,879
Quite honestly we talked so much about home automation and smart

403
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
Sync devices in the house but really

404
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
I Ortiz

405
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,559
Is going to be very big in in health and was just today that

406
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:39,679
I think Los Angeles hospital has put 80,000 of its patience on

407
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,239
Apple's Health kitten and such you know

408
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
So

409
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,359
There's so much Health Data out there and it's hard to get at it's hard to get at these

410
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,223
These different measurements which are constantly changing so devices like this are super helpful

411
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,527
Oh I agree in what I

412
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,623
And in talking to the CEO of scanadu his name is Walter de Brouwer

413
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,671
This man is so smart and so fun

414
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
But

415
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,511
Biggest thing that's going to be happening here is

416
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
He believes it

417
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,583
And if the combination of

418
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,375
The processing power in your phone

419
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
Cheap ubiquitous sensors

420
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
And

421
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,799
The digitization of medical data that can be aggregated and made searchable

422
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,335
And crowdsourced

423
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,407
Will basically create kind of a Moore's Law

424
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
The medical industry

425
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
Wish

426
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,575
Basically he means it's going to speed up the medical industry

427
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
Incredibly rapidly

428
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,183
So he thinks we're going to see all of this change

429
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
Consumer Healthcare

430
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,559
Faster than the personal computer change business and consumer technology

431
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,839
Back in like the 90

432
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
And that is

433
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,191
That is huge and I really don't think that many people

434
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,543
In like the pharmaceutical industry or the insurance industry kind of really grok that

435
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
So I cannot wait

436
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127
Exciting stuff

437
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
All right

438
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Well

439
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,247
Stay tuned because we are going to have Mark Ralston

440
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,039
The CEO of Argo designs

441
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,367
Come on the show and talk about how to design smart home apps

442
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,415
That will work on the Apple watch

443
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:08,767
Hey everybody we are back with the Internet of Things podcast

444
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
For all of you Apple watch

445
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,143
Aficionados and those of you who are just waiting to scoff at the Apple watch

446
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
I have a treat

447
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,519
I've Mark roasted who is the founder and chief creative

448
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
Officer at argodesign

449
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Highmark

450
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,175
I am really excited to have you here

451
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
You are also

452
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,295
Either of you have a naughty relationship with a company called Peak

453
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:36,159
They make a home hub that is sold in Best Buy and other stores

454
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:40,255
And I'd love for you to tell us a little bit about how you related to them

455
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,327
And we're going to talk a little bit about how you design

456
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
User interfaces

457
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
For the Smart Home

458
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
On the Apple watch

459
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:54,079
Yeah thank you thanks for inviting you puke is I guess some simple shorthand

460
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,991
Or one of the equity Partners in this company

461
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,599
Develops Smart Home Solution

462
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,671
The Client List

463
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
And I think that song

464
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,023
Just helps driver behavior in the different

465
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,839
Would Peak succeeds you guys succeed

466
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,887
All right we'll Peak is one of the

467
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
I'm going to go with almost

468
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,727
Almost a dozen kind of home hubs

469
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
I tried out and

470
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,871
Coming hopefully later this week you guys are going to do a refresh of the app

471
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
And the new version I've seen

472
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,711
Parts of it and I have some really cool

473
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,783
Kind of things and hopefully later on we'll talk a little bit about that

474
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
The first

475
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,111
We're going to focus on the watch because that

476
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
Is probably what everyone is focused on right now

477
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,231
So Mark why don't you start by telling us a little bit

478
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
Because you have one

479
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,839
Can you tell us a little bit about what you've experienced

480
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
Since you've had one in

481
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,655
What you like what you don't like

482
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
You're not sure

483
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,799
It's finished it on there for several days

484
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,591
And it's kind of a hot mess

485
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,407
Wait we should wish ask you which version did you get

486
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,223
I got the stainless

487
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
You'll

488
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,575
38 millimeter versions of a smaller one

489
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:14,463
The stainless steel band that wraps around

490
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,279
I'm hardware and it is absolutely gorgeous

491
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
Feels nice

492
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,351
Put on

493
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
Relatively comfortable

494
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:29,311
You know I don't want want to watch like 20 years if it's so far no 3 Days Inn

495
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
Beautiful logic

496
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,783
Votes not in yet

497
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,391
It's clearly going to be on screen quality

498
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,743
Beautiful bride

499
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,071
These little moments where

500
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,655
You look so you swipe up to get one particular menu

501
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,239
Like to watch you Excel if you can swipe up

502
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:04,639
To get the client has a slight down to get another menu

503
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
That's how that works

504
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
Let's go to another

505
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
And you

506
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,039
Costa-hawkins don't follow you

507
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,855
I just condition

508
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:19,232
I'm not even

509
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,816
It's cool it's definitely

510
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,656
One of those products do you got to learn it

511
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,728
Distance to complicated

512
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,776
For what it's actually do

513
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,360
It's certainly not like the first couple days of the iPhone

514
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,152
6 Mile

515
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,200
Is it a function of

516
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,248
There are too many

517
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
Different ways to

518
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:47,648
Control it like too many different options or is it just a function of they don't

519
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Logically

520
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
Seem to follow

521
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,304
Auntie Christmas early too much going on

522
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:02,240
Okay I can't find kind of a logical usually you can kind of see below the hook

523
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,920
And I'm not saying that they weren't grappling something that couldn't have been solved

524
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,968
Like maybe this is it

525
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
Because the nature of a problem

526
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,880
An interface on a risk that complicated it could be

527
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
Good

528
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,512
It is it just feels like I'm still trying to figure my way around

529
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
Surprise

530
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
I said to someone earlier today

531
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:37,568
And I kind of imagined play music I want Steve Jobs still

532
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,896
Loud and in charge of things this is the kind of product

533
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:45,248
He might have sent back and I know it's hard I don't care

534
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,320
I don't think you would have sounded that nice about

535
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,488
Mystery we want to keep our clean G rating

536
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:03,680
Again I want to sympathize with how complex it isn't then literally I'm new to this problem is

537
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,776
Because a problem Samsung did

538
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:14,176
Android Wear

539
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,760
Can you see Peyton icicle no more

540
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,088
All right

541
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
Glad

542
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,160
Little Caesars

543
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,768
Okay its design for tiny fingers

544
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
And so far it has a

545
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,864
We'll call it an inconsistent maybe syntax

546
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
Design syntax

547
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:41,568
The mechanic

548
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,408
The underlying interaction

549
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,248
Lamodels housing

550
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
1

551
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,320
Time elapsed

552
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,928
Watch faces sells a whole lot more than just

553
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
Breakdown

554
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,792
Once you get into a nap it's all pretty easy

555
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,584
You didn't want to ask me

556
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,144
Will guile to get back to the main menu

557
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,472
Watch face

558
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,312
And that's where things get weird notifications of course

559
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
Interrupt

560
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,456
Access

561
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
Annapolis

562
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
Exactly clear

563
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,064
Okay let's talk about building

564
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,904
The apps and con of working with notifications and all of that

565
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,000
Because some of the best apps that so far I've seen

566
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:36,352
On The Watcher that I've seen people review on the watch have been those that kind of

567
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,656
Appear to be very effective at

568
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:43,008
Managing notifications kind of in a Spartan Manor and also giving people

569
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,800
A lot of information or

570
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
Ability to take

571
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
Quick action

572
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,896
Swipe credit app

573
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
So

574
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,992
How were you kind of thinking about designing the app

575
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
For the peak homes

576
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,112
The promise the pcap

577
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,136
Pretty simple

578
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,256
The same way that a lot of this

579
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,816
It is very simple premise which is

580
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,608
I want to turn on my lights

581
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
Or

582
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:13,984
You know my favorite scenarios I'm coming home and I

583
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
Remote switch

584
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
Between away and home

585
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
Gunsmith a trigger

586
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,152
So do not lock the door

587
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,968
It's Great Compromise

588
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:31,904
Felt like the right place to do that sort of thing

589
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,976
Eventually become a voice control

590
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,256
Watch so far

591
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
Better than the phone

592
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
That

593
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:49,056
Along little things like a somebody just arrived home

594
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,592
The kids come home

595
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,920
Backdoor results

596
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
Camera

597
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,392
Is there how can I feel good

598
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
And it's crochet

599
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,488
That's one of the reasons

600
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,024
I like this

601
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,328
HomeSmart homes for rent

602
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,864
And we've been developing the app

603
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:17,472
Sounds great

604
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
And that we imagine

605
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,896
Will the Ikea track

606
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
2

607
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,712
Ronnie Lott

608
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,808
What WeChat

609
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:37,184
How that relationship works with the way up Apple setup to watch

610
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,096
Super sensible and SMS

611
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,912
Will they give me permission

612
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
Cereal place

613
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,520
City Cab

614
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:59,712
Right now I can't do that

615
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,296
And I can choose take a couple of those things because

616
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
First party

617
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
First access

618
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,904
Features

619
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,768
So instead of the watch being your home screen by default

620
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,584
Are the watch face being the home screen by default

621
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,984
The PCAT becomes my home screen by default

622
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,824
Las Vegas

623
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,128
Got much ones

624
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
So

625
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,992
It needs to go 90 further than just nearly I can

626
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,624
Customize the grid of icons ride with the phones and Android

627
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,696
IOS

628
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
Dama

629
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:47,328
Let's become mine and they're good equally accessible

630
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
First-party and third-party apps

631
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,264
Far far more control over that experience that little grid

632
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:01,152
On the way I can just fine

633
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
Watches just

634
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
One Step too many

635
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,576
William Anderson

636
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,416
Awesome just launching into getting a petit smartphone

637
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,256
Ticwatch app with B

638
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,048
Launching

639
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,840
Scream right now

640
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,656
Physical pain in the ass

641
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,216
It cuts out some of the possible Magic

642
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,408
Level access nothing

643
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:37,248
How many steps does it take to launch the app have you counted

644
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,832
Let's see okay so I got to reach over

645
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
Up comes the

646
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,512
Good rap songs

647
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,072
I can pretty much directly tap you up

648
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,888
And then I'm on at the first screen

649
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
Set alarm

650
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,216
Nicely designed and it's basically

651
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,520
The the anyone gets

652
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,152
Little squares

653
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,968
Some that utilize control

654
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,040
One aspect you how one of them could be the mode Switcher

655
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
The way

656
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:17,952
Another one can be kitchen lighting

657
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:23,840
And you just going to rain slows in a row on the watch so something the first one shows up and you swipe

658
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,632
Brighten you

659
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,424
So it's

660
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,960
It's three steps

661
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:35,360
Are four steps if I want to like turn off the light

662
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,408
Switch from home to work

663
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
2 steps

664
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,504
Envy Apple

665
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,344
Significantly better

666
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,208
Tiny tiny

667
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,536
Intimacy

668
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,120
I don't think it's funny at all because right now if I want to turn off the light

669
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,656
I hit a switch

670
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
I mean

671
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,776
Is usually the way we're trained now if I want to turn off a light if I

672
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,312
Counted out

673
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,872
Getting up I'm walking over to a place

674
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,408
And I'm turning off a light

675
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
But

676
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,224
In my head

677
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,760
When I think about it

678
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,344
All those other steps are complete until I get to the light and turn off

679
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,416
Like my brain just discounts all those other steps right

680
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
Today's news

681
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,168
That's a losing battle but a couple of things

682
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:37,056
A different way

683
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,080
Are there

684
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,504
That's one aspect of this compound

685
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
The way of being

686
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
Address of house

687
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,440
Lily magical scenarios

688
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,280
Watch and various switches that mean IQ

689
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,840
Weirdest shifting gears

690
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,912
Another was much more complex

691
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
Shifting into night mode

692
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:11,360
Which Baron allows the bathroom light to turn on read it supposed to light so that it doesn't

693
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,408
Or

694
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
Steering wheel

695
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
Lights up

696
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,528
When it notices someone's walking up a stairwell

697
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
Excelsior

698
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,600
Beautiful

699
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,440
The watch then it's less about these like

700
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,512
One switch after another but instead

701
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
Youth small gloves

702
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,352
Controls

703
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,656
The Peaks Apple Watch app

704
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,824
So my kitchen camera

705
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
I can see.

706
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,896
I think maybe two steps

707
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,504
Raptor on the pole counting steps for the same thing

708
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,344
I can do that while I'm still in the meeting and not be staring down at

709
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,696
Lansing MI watch

710
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,720
In the office

711
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,536
And let's talk about this broad kind of

712
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,096
Design rules for the Apple watch

713
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
And

714
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,192
You know let's just about design rules kind of for the wrist

715
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
Even you know

716
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,032
Well we'll keep it probably more Apple watch Focus

717
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,616
You know if I'm breaking it down I'm thinking about

718
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,664
And in tying it to the Smart Home

719
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,712
Or the smartoffice however we want to

720
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
I think about that

721
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,552
You know I'm thinking about it in terms of notification

722
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,088
Versus

723
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
Taking an action

724
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,160
In a building where maybe I'm not

725
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,720
Or maybe I'm in it and I just

726
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,744
I want to turn my lights off

727
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
Without getting up

728
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,792
So

729
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,376
What are kind of the things I want to think about from a notice

730
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
Application standpoint

731
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,216
As a user I can think about

732
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,520
You know I don't want to be overwhelmed by notification

733
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,080
I've already a little overwhelmed

734
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
Sometimes

735
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,152
Buzz false alarms

736
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,688
And also things that

737
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,992
You know what I get on my phone and I'm like

738
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,296
I really can't do anything

739
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,368
This information I think you were with me one day when I was like

740
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,696
What am I motion detectors has been moved in

741
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:02,976
It's a

742
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
Closet

743
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,840
My house right now so when they happen

744
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,424
BMI

745
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,704
Yasso

746
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,008
So I don't really want to get that on my watch because that's

747
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,568
Yeah it's going to help me

748
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,360
Frenzy of worrying

749
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:24,992
You know if I don't have my phone on me there's probably really legit reason for not having it right in front of my face

750
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Set the time so

751
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
You can think about early

752
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,232
Notifications on the phone

753
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,608
They were basically an extension

754
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,496
Latin for the extension of what astronauts have become in the market

755
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,544
It's important call out

756
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:52,128
Look like now notifications and Pulaski

757
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:56,992
It's just a design flaw since I can't just quote

758
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,296
I got really talked about the fact

759
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:02,112
Sociology

760
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:08,000
With the song

761
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,816
People have changed at the same rate

762
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,864
That was come up with new ideas

763
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:17,472
How to communicate small static messages

764
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
People

765
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,056
Spencer trying to do other things

766
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
Scorned

767
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,688
They've grown to want to see information of 30

768
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,808
Vielen dank

769
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,344
Despotic scepter

770
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:37,184
But literally just moving Target of people grow into

771
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,256
Living with nothing

772
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
Ears

773
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,912
Show me exactly what I need to see

774
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,104
I want to see interesting things about it

775
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,384
Is

776
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,016
Hard to pull up and they don't stay up on the screen unlike the clock face

777
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,320
I get the logic that they it's like

778
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,280
The message

779
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,864
Fake police things basically

780
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,704
Your listings you feel the vibration

781
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,544
Little something I was typing when one of them went off

782
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
And

783
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,832
Retreat at pointed

784
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,648
Interrupted me

785
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
Made its presence known

786
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,536
Couldn't wouldn't stay long enough so that I can get to read it

787
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,632
Turn out to be one of those rules

788
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,448
At least Apple earnings

789
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,664
Right now it's spending so much time

790
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,552
Ninja gets battery feel like I spend almost half the energy dealing the watch on my wrist

791
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,344
Just keeping awake

792
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,904
Going to do with it, single it for me

793
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,168
Menu operations clear enough

794
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,848
On taking Act

795
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,872
The flip side of notice

796
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,664
Applications

797
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,944
Taking action

798
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,528
It's cool tell little commands

799
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,624
It's a very short concise list of things you can do

800
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,440
Get to the fullback

801
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,232
Enough talk response

802
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,072
And

803
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,608
So you like song

804
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,168
Whatever you want

805
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
Absolutely beautiful

806
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
Works really well

807
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,056
Lieutenant standing

808
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,360
I will Siri works on your list

809
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,456
Given the limitations and processing time

810
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,784
Ergonomics

811
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
Your list

812
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,832
Galatea

813
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,624
Bad idea

814
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648
Beautifully well

815
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,184
Absolutely meaning creature

816
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,024
They can imagine them really tuning the whole messaging systems where

817
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,584
The list of the central Play Store

818
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,120
Carry on conversation with me

819
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:31,520
Right now it's still a little weird it's just too hard to get them

820
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,480
Because it is bad new

821
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,040
But I realized

822
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,624
Even if it takes

823
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
Ocean

824
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,256
Interrupt your conversation with people

825
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
What are Deep Pockets

826
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:58,656
You know exactly how to use it exactly how it will be on

827
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
The Watch

828
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,752
Easter version 1.0

829
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,312
Liabilities actually

830
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,872
Inconsistent

831
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,016
Fall back asleep

832
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:18,624
I think I can fix that I can imagine 1.11.5

833
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,672
If you get that reliability down

834
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,488
I can never lose that talk about how these

835
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
Interactions of Steel

836
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,096
Right now it's pretty tough

837
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,400
Making judgments about them because they are

838
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
Other beasts

839
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,776
Call Tanya

840
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:41,664
It's kind of like me in the morning you should never make a judgment about me early in the morning cuz I am

841
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,944
To try to find

842
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,992
And I'm just clearly not at my best

843
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,320
And I'm going to ask you one more question because you're a big voice

844
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,368
Aficionado kind of like me

845
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
Can the Smart Home

846
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,952
And you and I have before the show were talking about

847
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,024
The Amazon Echo and using it to control our hue light

848
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,328
With Siri being on the

849
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,376
Apple watch in that being such a

850
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,424
Good experience so far for you

851
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
Nailed it

852
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
So

853
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,312
How was your divvy up kind of the idea of

854
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
Controlling

855
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
Voice

856
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,640
On your wrist

857
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,456
VS kind of right now I just shot up into my house

858
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
Or if I'm in

859
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,272
The bedroom I shout into the room

860
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,856
I speak into the sea the echo remote

861
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Control

862
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
So

863
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,720
Do you have a sense of like where we might go with

864
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,256
Voice Control in the home

865
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:33,120
Yeah I think I imagine the watch adopt

866
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,424
That's good angle button

867
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:41,056
Siri takes over whatever you want

868
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,128
You can want you to invoke Siri you can

869
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:48,736
You can say lots of things that are in that something poking lots of different application

870
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,272
What are you say you want to

871
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,552
Look up

872
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,856
Something on the web look up an address

873
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,184
You're doing it from the same Central interface

874
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
And talking

875
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,256
And

876
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,560
Mustard seed

877
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,608
Because at that point you could then say

878
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,728
Siri or you can pull them to say tell Peak to set my home

879
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,592
The computer on your wrist starts making

880
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,872
Incredibles

881
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,224
And all of the things of complained about the sleepiness of the lodge

882
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,784
The number of clicks on that goes away

883
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:27,136
I think as you have concrete

884
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,184
Holding the button down and Truckin

885
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,512
You let the computer catch up and its own time because

886
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,888
Xian in Computing

887
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,240
Tastic advantage in the real world

888
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,824
And the originals optionality

889
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:51,968
You and I

890
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,064
In the bedroom there anywhere you can just shout turn on the

891
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
Bedroom light

892
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,416
Electric Repair the system you just say that and

893
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
Echo

894
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
Simpson desert

895
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,048
Willingly takes a second what we were recognizes

896
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
Wow that's impressive

897
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,376
It just feels good

898
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,752
Points in Tyler Technologies

899
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,896
And that's why I think when you actually do it doesn't well

900
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
The Watch

901
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:27,808
Ultimately that promise

902
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,344
To finicky the field Magic

903
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:41,120
Got it will wait till home cake comes out too so there's there's more on Horizon not just version

904
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,912
This is all going to be Newton

905
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
Couple months hopefully

906
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,776
Indeed well we'll get this out very soon so

907
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,056
No worries

908
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
All right

909
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,128
Thanks so much for coming on the show

910
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,223
All right

911
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,527
We're going to call that a wrap thanks for joining us

912
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
And
