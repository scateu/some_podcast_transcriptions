Phone and what that means for

15
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,656
Home app

16
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,680
Arlo

Jesse Clayton

26
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,064
Of Nvidia he's talking about Jets and which is

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,832
Actually wanted

28
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,416
The fastest growing industrial iot platforms

29
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,440
Mostly because it can

30
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,488
AI at the edge

31
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,304
So you learned a lot about that stay tuned for it

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,352
We're also going to have a message from praetorian

33
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,120
A security

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
A voicemail

35
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,192
Talking about

36
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
Enterprise

37
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
Echo skill

38
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,336
Pretty sweet so let's get it all started with a message

39
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,360
From our sponsor

40
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:26,272
This week sponsor is Bosch interested in all things iot the Bosch connected World log covers

41
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,600
A wide range of iot topics from around the world

42
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
Such as industry for a mobility blockchain and adtech checkout blog

43
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:41,120
Bosch - s i.com for articles case studies

44
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,520
Interviews and more actually one of my favorite blogs I do find myself thinking too though

45
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,336
Those often so check it out

46
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
Now

47
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,152
Let's talk about our favorite topic

48
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
Gdpr

49
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
Okay

50
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
Gdpr stands for

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,368
General data protection regulation

52
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,672
This was a lot it was actually

53
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,696
Enacted

54
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464
A while back

55
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,744
By the EU

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,584
But just came into effect on May 25th so last Friday

57
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
And it's been a mess

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
Yes

59
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,008
Everyone was kind of only this actually

60
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
Is actually going to have an impact

61
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,336
Beyond just all the Privacy regulation

62
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,432
Have you had a lot of privacy regulations

63
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Coming in your email

64
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,992
I've had more

65
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,808
Privacy regulation notifications

66
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
And

67
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:39,232
Re-up on subscriptions to email addresses that I don't really care about then I normally get at CES

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,304
I mean it's been in Spain

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
And it's so bad

70
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,704
And some companies are so unprepared for this which I don't understand why cuz we knew it was coming that

71
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
Certain

72
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,520
Content providers news outlets

73
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,824
Are actually providing different

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,872
Sites of their news

75
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
To the EU areas

76
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
I believe USA Today is one

77
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,272
In fact it's much faster because

78
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040
Pause

79
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,856
There's no tracking information JavaScript and all kinds of other

80
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:11,232
Fun stuff just HTML pictures Alonzo for sale

81
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
It is Miss I should actually take the

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
The time to say to all of our EU

83
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
Citizens and listeners

84
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,424
And pretty much everyone who listens because I actually care about you

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
Your privacy when you listen to

86
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Cast when you go to the website

87
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
We don't

88
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,128
Track you for add purposes because our sponsors actually pay for every

89
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
They don't get your

90
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Information

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,296
Information if you sign up for the newsletter I do get your email address and I will use it

92
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,088
To send you the newsletter

93
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
And then also I do use it

94
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
Marketing on

95
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,952
Facebook to you

96
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
Sometimes

97
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,792
So but not in any weird crazy way

98
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
I don't think it's any

99
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,680
Just so you know about our ad policies

100
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
We try to keep it

101
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Really respectful and

102
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,080
I don't want your information sorry

103
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,872
And Kevin Kevin wants another

104
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,408
I don't want anything

105
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Do you want to send that to

106
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
No no no

107
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,320
Alright so what's happening with iot devices is

108
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
A little bit uncertain so far

109
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,184
What we have seen is a couple devices

110
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Installing offline

111
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,024
Actually one noted case it's a

112
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
Light from

113
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,071
Company in China

114
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
Great white

115
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
They stop supporting their app

116
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
The Apple Barn

117
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,031
Yeah I don't think I meant to because

118
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
Accents fixed it

119
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
No

120
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
No no that's right Guy season announcement the European server service will be restored within a week and some people there

121
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
Devices work going to a

122
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
Server in Germany

123
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,623
And that's where they couldn't access the server

124
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
So

125
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,791
Do you enterprising yeelight on her said I'm just switching the server to your Singapore Airline and that's how they got around us but that's

126
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
It's not the answer

127
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
Hardcore

128
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Route to take

129
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
For your lights to work

130
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,471
And this is why we should have cloudless hugs

131
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
Exactly

132
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
So

133
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,919
A couple other connected devices what you would see is things like there's a picture on Twitter of

134
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
Someone's Samsung

135
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
Smart

136
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,527
Refrigerator family Hub refrigerator

137
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,343
Displaying a gdpr privacy notice

138
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
Now it's worth noting that

139
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
This person pointed out

140
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,975
They said this is just a notification to go to Samsung

141
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
When you clicked okay

142
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
You're actually

143
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
Not opting in

144
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
You're just saying

145
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
Seeing that I need

146
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
So that was

147
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
A good way to do it next also

148
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,799
If people went over to turn their thermostats

149
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,847
On stay actually showed them

150
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Similar

151
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,199
Application so most people seem to be working

152
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
There's just a lot of thing

153
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
I'll tell you

154
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,087
I am reading through a lot of these policies especially

155
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,879
Connected devices IP

156
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
To have something on that

157
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Soon

158
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
But I am

159
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,839
I may be reading for quite some time

160
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
All right

161
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
So that's

162
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
Gdpr

163
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,983
Now we'll move into last week

164
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,799
And a little bit into this week's big story which was

165
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823
Holy cow

166
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
Z-Wave has been hacked

167
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Only

168
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
Like many iot

169
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,527
Hacking stories this is maybe less scandalous that it first.

170
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,087
Here's what this is talking about is

171
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,415
Back in 2013 and I believe again in 2016

172
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,975
Hackers found a way to get access to Z-Wave

173
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Devices Inc

174
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
Was it difficult because you had to be

175
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
Within 30 to 40

176
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,911
It was possible

177
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
So

178
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,007
The Z-Wave Alliance actually changed their sick

179
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
Security stand

180
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,079
In all devices that were

181
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,127
Where are certified after April 2nd

182
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
A flask

183
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,943
Had to comply with what

184
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
Called S2 secure

185
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
A lot of devices out there that are not S2

186
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Compliant

187
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,159
Titan II but this latest security hack

188
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
Is very similar

189
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
To the ones from

190
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
A couple years back

191
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
Basically what happens is

192
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
The researchers have found a way

193
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,167
Trollback NES to device

194
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
0 which means

195
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
They can basically perpetrate

196
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Trait that same hat

197
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
Freak out

198
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
Kevin and I are not so worried

199
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
Because again this requires

200
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
Really close physical

201
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Proximity

202
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
It feels like the same

203
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,343
Height of level of danger of someone trying to get access to your Wi-Fi password

204
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,927
Sneaking in and trying to see the Authentication

205
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
And getting access to the

206
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231
Encrypted password

207
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
Router tries to kill

208
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:35,679
New devices the threat window for somebody trying to do the Z-Wave hack is like 20 milliseconds

209
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
It has to be very precise

210
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,799
Have to be close by I mean is it possible sure

211
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,383
It's possible but if you were s to device

212
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,479
Does get rolled back or if you add an S 0 device to Z-Wave Network

213
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,527
You should actually get notified

214
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
That such a thing as half

215
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
So we got all excited about this

216
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
But

217
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,183
There's kind of a little bit of a downside which is

218
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
Not many hubs rs2 certified

219
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
So we looked at the wink hub

220
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
Not as to certify

221
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
According to

222
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
It's

223
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,167
That that's the wink Hub to the newest one

224
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
Is the wink Hub 2

225
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,519
We look for small things also does not appear to have

226
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
Which means if you were happy

227
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
You wouldn't know

228
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,151
We should probably put the link

229
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,551
In the show notes to the catalog on Z-Wave Alliance where you can actually look up on the database what devices

230
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
Are certified and if you look

231
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
For your device

232
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,927
It'll actually say if it has S2

233
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,951
Compliance

234
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
We will do it

235
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,791
Okay so that is the

236
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Scoop

237
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
On the Z-Wave

238
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Challenges

239
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Now

240
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
What else do we

241
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,959
Have you rebooted your

242
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
Louder yet Kevin

243
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:47,615
I have not even though the FBI is suggesting please reboot your router everybody

244
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
And I

245
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,735
This actually all started last week with a

246
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
I guess it would be called a botnet

247
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Attack

248
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,391
I think it was targeted towards the Ukrainian electrical grid but obviously it's

249
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:04,255
To create the attack it's not just using routers and things in Ukraine season 2 from all over the world

250
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303
I think it's called vpnfilter

251
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,607
Attitude Target certain routers

252
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,703
Turn Linksys mikrotik Netgear and tp-link +

253
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,103
What the FBI is saying and they actually took control of the server that was spreading this so that's good

254
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
Goodbye still may be out there on routers

255
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
They're saying just reboot your router

256
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,015
I don't think that's enough and if you're that concerned

257
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:31,647
I think what you really need to do is factory reset your router because rebooting it if the code is

258
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Persistent

259
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,719
It's going to be there when you reboot so

260
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
I know that resetting a router is

261
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
A challenges of pain

262
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,375
But if you're that concerned I think we should do the extra step and do that

263
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
Reset it

264
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,727
Note to you guys especially if you have lots of connected devices

265
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,031
Your house when you reset your router

266
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,431
Make sure you do the exact password otherwise

267
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
Like a crazy person

268
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
Resetting your SSID and password

269
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
On

270
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:06,463
Yeah I mean that's the thing you have to determine how far you want to go here because some people may say well I don't even want you the same

271
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
SSID Android password

272
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:14,399
What what you're going to do that if you don't use it is exactly what you said Stacy you're not to go back and every single device that connects to your voice

273
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,239
Wi-Fi network is going to be reconfigured to work with a new coil coating new network

274
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
Have fun you guys

275
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
All right

276
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
So after

277
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
Rebooted router

278
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
Continue listening to our show so you

279
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,199
You can find out why Amazon whole biosecurity firm

280
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
I thought this was a really good article

281
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,319
Call Julie Jacobson / @cee Pro

282
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
She Wrote

283
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
A story about

284
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
Amazon's need for a security firm

285
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Because

286
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
As we talked about

287
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
Forever on the show

288
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
Security is the gateway drug to this

289
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
Amazon needs to have

290
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
This Plus

291
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:51,263
They need actual boots on the ground and a security company already has those and we've talked about companies like

292
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
Ben has been on the market

293
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,175
They have been for sale so it's totally possible

294
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
That you would see Amazon pick up a cup

295
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,319
Company like Vivint maybe like an ATT they have private Equity arnaud's now that

296
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Might want to sell that

297
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
My money would be on Vivint

298
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,183
Because they've basically been owned by the same product

299
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
For a while

300
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Aunt

301
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,999
It's getting raped

302
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
It's getting raped

303
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
So

304
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
Julie points out a couple really

305
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
Stupid things

306
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,679
Amazon can't install their own security

307
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,495
Products without having alarm certification

308
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
So they need to get that

309
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
They also want

310
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
More technicians for their Amazon expert service

311
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
And they want

312
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
To basically

313
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
Sell more devices so

314
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
If you have an alarm code

315
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
You got it

316
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
That's a ton of stuff

317
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
And

318
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,135
That gives them service revenue from

319
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
Remote network monitoring system

320
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
And they can become

321
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
I'm like this amazing managed service

322
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Which is something the Broadband come

323
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
Please also would like to

324
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607
To be in the security

325
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
Amazon

326
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,215
Would be in a better position because they have

327
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
Madam a

328
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Assistant

329
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
And

330
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,311
That gives her

331
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
Car more intelligent

332
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
It's kind of a win

333
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:05,247
So I'm not going to say Julie's wrong I still think Amazon ends up buying wink

334
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:10,111
Cuz I don't think they Echo Hub or Echo Plus is all that but that's just me

335
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,975
And Amazon is deploying when Cubs through their Smart Home Security

336
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,303
Offering the strange thing is Julie points out that they need

337
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
To be certified

338
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:26,239
Installers in because of certain laws regulations and such to shed their very quirky laws Amazon is already installing

339
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,031
Chinese with Amazon employees

340
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
So she kind of lost me there I got to be honest

341
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
There are rules in

342
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
Each state

343
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
About

344
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
Can do what associate

345
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551
So it may be that there installing this but there

346
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
I could be

347
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
So

348
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
If Julie if you're listening let us know

349
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
I still think

350
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
I do think it's a good idea

351
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
I'm not going to lie

352
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
I think it's probably

353
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Pretty smart so we'll see what happens

354
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,655
Maybe we'll have fancy fancy news from

355
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Amazon

356
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
Okay and now let's talk about

357
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,311
Low-power wide area Networks

358
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
And

359
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
Let's go

360
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
So basically

361
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,943
Ways to get Enterprise in industrial stuff online

362
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,735
So there's a new

363
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:14,111
Partnership between two companies one we've talked about before which is sick Fox they have a proprietary

364
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,671
Networks that they are trying to roll out around the world

365
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
And here Technologies which

366
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,047
Does a lot of mapping data location type information

367
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,631
Their location sweet the here location Suite references

368
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
Billions of Wi-Fi hotspots and when you combine the Wi-Fi hotspots with sigfox as Network now you've got

369
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
Hit capability to track

370
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,151
Tag Assets in the supply chain and Logistics area

371
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:42,015
So that's what they're doing their dancing a partnership to develop and deploy a global location service

372
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,415
For supply chain Logistics they don't mention anybody using it so this is brand-new this is just a partnership

373
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:53,791
Chip and they're talking about the baking a 1.9 trillion dollar opportunity for Global supply chain and Logistics

374
00:13:54,047 --> 00:14:00,191
But I think it's a smart partnership because they're bringing together to readily accessible Technologies here

375
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,591
Providing an option to the traditional cellular companies and you know nb-iot and other Technologies for

376
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
This type of thing

377
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
Speaking of it

378
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
Electric amp which makes

379
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
A module it was

380
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
Originally

381
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,855
Was more secure and

382
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,647
Provided you connect Electric

383
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
Saint Cloud so basically it was like

384
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
Iot in a box

385
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,119
So now I have intercellular which is a cellular version it offers LTE Cat 1 in 3-g

386
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,935
And you can do lots of it's got Computing on it every

387
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
And then

388
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,263
Eventually they're going to add

389
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
Q4

390
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
A cat

391
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,103
Mnb iot

392
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,455
And just for you guys who may not be super familiar with various cellular

393
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Low power wide area Networks

394
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
Cat 1M

395
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Allows you to

396
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
Use more data

397
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
So

398
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
How to make

399
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
Did I believe it

400
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
It is end

401
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,463
The cellular providers can roll that out

402
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
Pretty much with a software

403
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Nb-iot

404
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,071
You're looking at smaller data

405
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
So are slower data

406
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:05,727
So you can transfer less data and the other providers actually have to update their infrastructure

407
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
A little bit more

408
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
War at their towers

409
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
Worst to support

410
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
They are supporting it it's

411
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,127
Becoming very much the standard

412
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,943
But you gotta figure application

413
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
And one makes sense

414
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
Smaller less data rich

415
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Nb-iot

416
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,599
So is this good news

417
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:26,207
Electric imp has done a really good job for Enterprise customers of making it

418
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,791
Very easy to get something online and keep it consistent

419
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
Around the world

420
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,375
So this is been popular in regulated Industries

421
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,679
Where you can get approvals for

422
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Your cloud provider

423
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
Cellular provider and then

424
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
You're done

425
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,799
Which is nice so

426
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:46,943
We'll see more about this pricing for the cellular connectivity is going to be based on the number of devices connected

427
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
And it'll just automatically go through

428
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Count

429
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Your devices that

430
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:56,415
Are charged in the US that use T-Mobile AT&T

431
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,463
Wherever you have the best cover

432
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,791
So it sounds a lot like what twilio is doing with their

433
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
Wireless connectivity

434
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
Deprogram as well

435
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,167
It's great because we're seeing a lot of these middlemen come in

436
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
And provide

437
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:12,799
Cellular connectivity without companies having to go and try to do deals with a site

438
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
Which if you're not a big company

439
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
It's tough

440
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
And even if you are a big company

441
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
You may want something that's a bit more

442
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Mike Lobel

443
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,903
You can actually pre-order this module 2 and get it around July 30th through 85 bucks which isn't too terrible X

444
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
Expensive if you want to do some prototyping and testing

445
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
All right

446
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
Let's go on to

447
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
You are experienced

448
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,887
Yesterday Kevin and I

449
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,983
Hey let's test out that Amazon smart scheduling stuff

450
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
About last week end

451
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
We spent like an hour

452
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,199
It was surprising

453
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
That's kind of because you really have to be preconfigured in a sense to use it effectively and the more we

454
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
Set it up

455
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,975
The more I realize this is not something consumers are going to use this is more of it

456
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Enterprise

457
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:08,095
Type service and it's going to be Enterprise within your own

458
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
Surprise so this is

459
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,911
Probably great for intern

460
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,471
Turn on meeting so what this is is basically your

461
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
Able to say

462
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Madam

463
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
And again

464
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,079
We do that to avoid setting off your

465
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,103
Amazon Echo

466
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
Madam

467
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
Schedule a meeting with

468
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
And

469
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,271
Then theoretically she's supposed to say

470
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
What time is the meeting

471
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
Or she might

472
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
Suggest a schedule

473
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
Yoshi first check

474
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:38,559
Both calendars to see what options are available explains you are both available from this time this time and this

475
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
This time to this time when would you like to meet

476
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
SEPTA

477
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,191
To make this all work cuz it sounds awesome cuz you have to pay to schedule meeting

478
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,239
It's right to make this work you have to

479
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
Have a couple things going

480
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
You have to have your

481
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
Calendar linked to

482
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127
The Amazon Echo

483
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
2

484
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,967
You actually have to share your calendar access

485
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,271
With the person you're trying to make

486
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Appointment

487
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,855
That's why I say this is more of an Enterprise play

488
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
Yes so

489
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
I did share my calendar with

490
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Then he shared his with

491
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
But this is not something

492
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
We would normally do

493
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,791
And you also

494
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,607
How to make sure your contacts are

495
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
Queen when they go into

496
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,239
So for example I had an old email

497
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
Address for Kevin

498
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,079
In one of my contacts in that unfortunately is the

499
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
Madame Mao

500
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Looks at

501
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,479
So you can't edit your contacts for

502
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
From within

503
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
The app

504
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
The Amazon app

505
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
You have to go to York on

506
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Text app

507
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,391
And then once you've done that

508
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,207
It doesn't actually propagate right away to

509
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,815
Amazon and that depends for me it did propagate cuz I did at Stacy's

510
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:49,215
Information as well in my native contacts app I did it on my iPhone and it propagated immediately you did it on your

511
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,775
I don't know which Android phone you have and it didn't

512
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
It didn't propagate for like

513
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
It now has the

514
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,711
It's a cool

515
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
Service without a doubt

516
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:06,879
And to be honest I mean I would schedule meetings with third-parties when I worked in corporate all the time and if there

517
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
In my contacts that might have their information

518
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,023
I wouldn't necessarily be sharing calendars with them so it would not work for that

519
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,607
You can set a calendar hold oh so you can actually do it

520
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,887
And what'll happen is

521
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
The calendar invite will be

522
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,447
Email to them

523
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
And then they can see it

524
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
Yeah that's

525
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,847
Nice the other nice thing about this I thought maybe it was

526
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,943
Specific to Amazon made Echo devices only has some features

527
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,247
Are only for Amazon devices

528
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:38,367
But I tried it this morning on the Sonos one that has met him a built-in

529
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,207
And I was able to do the exact same thing with Miss Stacy so it

530
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,767
Does work on 3rd party Echo devices

531
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,583
So there you have it in this is compatible with Microsoft

532
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
65

533
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,423
Google G suite and several other popular

534
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,215
Corporate email applications so

535
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
Yeah maybe

536
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:58,079
If you got people you schedule meetings with a lot and this is something you're interested in

537
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Maybe just

538
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,663
Connect with them and you're like hey let's do this calendar sharing

539
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:05,247
So a rhetorical question why doesn't the Google home do this

540
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Yeah

541
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,695
Let Me Ride Along I did actually run into Mark Speights who's in charge of Google speakers efforts

542
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,231
Add a conference I was at last week

543
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,047
And I asked him about that and he actually said

544
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,839
But that is a common complaint

545
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
And their works

546
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,935
I didn't feel much better but you don't

547
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
There we have

548
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
All right

549
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
Essential phone

550
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,823
Kevin I saw this and I was really sad because

551
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,871
Cuz the essential phone is not doing well

552
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
The company Maybe

553
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
Not develop the essential phone 2

554
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
Might be able to sell that

555
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
Business what's going

556
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:44,415
Yeah there's been some talk of essential putting itself up for sale definitely cancelling II essential

557
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,767
The first one it has not sold well the estimates are like a hundred fifty thousand

558
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,607
Diamonds which is nothing in the grand scheme of things

559
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,679
Basically brought the Android operating system to Google

560
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,215
When Google purchased Android

561
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:03,615
He's in charge of essential and he put a tweet out saying you know we're constantly evaluating our products and

562
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
We are

563
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:10,783
Still focused on creating great mobile and Home Products and

564
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
Products we do care about because

565
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
Andy had said when

566
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
The company launched that they were going to

567
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,256
Bring forth the ambient OS that would tie all of our home devices together

568
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:26,912
We haven't seen that I've spoken to the central at CES and pretty much got a no comment you know things are in the works when we haven't

569
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:33,312
Oracle share what is this mean for ambient OS I don't know I mean if they get sold maybe they still plow ahead with that

570
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,128
Maybe they don't I don't know is a lot up in the air right now

571
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,176
Was really excited to see Andy Robinson

572
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
Interpretation of

573
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Like a smart home

574
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,112
So I am too but I was always concerned about it and I still am because

575
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,768
He and said that they're just going to work with public apis from all the different device makers to tie everything together and those epi

576
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
Does change all the time

577
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
So I don't know

578
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
All right

579
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
We won't stay depressed over that

580
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,448
Let's talk

581
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,800
Be smart cameras made by

582
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,896
For some users they haven't been able to log into their app for so

583
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
Days

584
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
And

585
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
I got to save

586
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,296
The response to this has not been awesome so

587
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,088
Took a while to figure this out

588
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,648
And then they're saying it's a DNS issue

589
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,976
For users and user should reset their DNS setting

590
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Switch

591
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
That's a pretty ticket

592
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
Nothing to ask

593
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,608
Sweet easy to do but most people

594
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:33,216
It just happens automatically don't worry about it with a lot of people have never been into the DNS settings

595
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
Suck ya

596
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
That's not the answer

597
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,664
Also this week D-Link has some new Wi-Fi cameras and they have home connectivity

598
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
Play with

599
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
Google

600
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Assistant

601
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,112
Amazon Alexa and if they send that there's a trio of cameras the HD Wi-Fi camera which will cost

602
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,024
5999 there's a full HD Wi-Fi camera for 8999 and then a full HD pan-and-tilt

603
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,072
Wi-Fi camera for 9999

604
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:05,472
What I like about these they offer for different service levels if you want to subscribe or not that's up to you

605
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,056
Cloud storage of the video they have a free option

606
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,640
That works with three cameras and has a 24-hour rolling

607
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
History of what's being captured

608
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,480
Do they have a basic option for a week

609
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
But you can get

610
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
For 25 bucks a year

611
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Premium option

612
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,648
For 14 days and also adds two more cameras 05 cameras for $50 a year

613
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,440
In the pro version Story video for

614
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:31,840
30 days in the cloud but you have 10 cameras and is $100 a year I actually like that pricing scheme and I wish

615
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:37,728
Companies would kind of look at that give you those kind of different levels and even up the number of devices as well

616
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,288
Opportunity

617
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:45,920
So we also have a quick update LG 2018 TVs now work with the

618
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Amazon Echo

619
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
So you can talk to Madam a

620
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,528
Using your LG

621
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,600
Already had Google Assistant social condition of

622
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Amazon

623
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,416
And I don't really care

624
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
For homekit

625
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
But I'm really excited about the

626
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,000
These devices so Elgato

627
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
Which makes

628
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,560
Homekit enabled sensor

629
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
And other connected

630
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,144
Devices

631
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
Sprinkler

632
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,984
Control system actually it's like a hose control system

633
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
Andale

634
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,288
Lamp called the eve

635
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
Claire so

636
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
Kevin thought I'd be excited by the

637
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
Slayer lamp

638
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
But I do love my lighting and this is homekit enabled

639
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
Portable LED lamp

640
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,016
Commercially available

641
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,320
Europe

642
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,112
Gdpr compliant

643
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,952
It reminds me the Phillips has one called the Goliath

644
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,256
And that's out like a light it looks like a bowl

645
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
Close

646
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
So that is available

647
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
It's 99 years

648
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
And then

649
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,912
Elgato

650
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Aqua

651
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
Is basically

652
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,824
A little irrigation controller so far

653
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,872
But this is homekit enabled it's

654
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,200
Create schedules for the cult your sprinkler system

655
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,504
This really attaches to a spigot

656
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,320
And then you can control your outdoor irrigation

657
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,392
And that's going to be 9995

658
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,208
And it can be pre-ordered from the Elgato website in the

659
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
Us

660
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
As of now

661
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,768
So

662
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,048
If your homekit enabled

663
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,144
That's actually pretty cool and maybe I would buy it and just use homekit for that

664
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
I don't know

665
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:15,520
We'll see how so we got a quick update for the Schlage sense deadbolt

666
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:19,872
Which is now compatible with Google assistant so you can ask Google if your door is locked

667
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,664
You can say lock my door

668
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:28,064
You cannot unlock the door like you can with certain locks and the echo when you do that with an echo it will actually a

669
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,600
Ask for a PIN to unlock

670
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,136
Adore as well as

671
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416
The command to unlock it

672
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:38,816
For security reasons so maybe they will add that but for the moment you can lock or check the status with a Schlage sense deadbolt

673
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,608
And finally

674
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
Philips Hue has a new app

675
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,424
And I'm going to tell you

676
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
Guys it's really good

677
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,008
I have not been I don't use my Philips

678
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Q app.

679
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
I got most of it automated

680
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
You just control it

681
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,408
Voice

682
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
But the new app

683
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
Especially for a colors and scenes

684
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,808
I like it so give that a try if you are a Philips Hue

685
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
And let us know what you think

686
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,160
Finally we have a quick correction

687
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,232
Couple weeks ago we were talking about habitat which is a

688
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,256
Local

689
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
It's also connect

690
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,584
The idea is that it is a locally control

691
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
We said that it had WiFi

692
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
It is not

693
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
It connects to

694
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
Your router via is

695
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,776
So there you have it

696
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
You don't like hubs like Kevin doesn't like

697
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
I Cubs this mean

698
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Or rather

699
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,408
You don't like the direct connection

700
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,344
And it's just a location thing for me sometimes people's routers are not in a central area in which case smart home device

701
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
Isis man range issues

702
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,440
So that's my bigger concern that in

703
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
Ports on my router but that's a whole nother issue

704
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
Do not get him started

705
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,792
Don't get me started

706
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
Bad

707
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,144
So we can distract you

708
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
Quick quick

709
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,216
Let's go to our

710
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,264
Iot podcast listener hotline

711
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,288
And guess what

712
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:58,688
You guys I have an ecobee SI it works with Google Assistant it works with Amazon

713
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,504
On Echo it is not the pretty cool awesome

714
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
Ecobee that I like

715
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
But it is

716
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
A really nice connected thermostat

717
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:10,976
And if you want to get a connect to thermostat or free just call and leave us voicemail

718

7 4

721
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
R24

00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
June 5th

724
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,984
Teeth so that can chew

725
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520

Guinda and

730
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
Ecobee SI

731
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,248
Worst case scenario you get a free internet connected thermostat

732
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
It works

733
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
What's not to love

734
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,088
Okay so this week

735
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,112
Voicemail is

736
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
Actually a really cool suggestion

737
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,208
The brings us back into this Enterprise area of

738
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Merrimack

739
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
Some Kevin in Raleigh

740
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,328
Hi Stacy and Kevin Kevin and Raleigh

741
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
Remember Stacy

742
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:55,008
Saying something I believe it might have been on

743
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
Enterprise

744
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,568
And iot

745
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:02,432
Devices not sensors but things like the echo Etc

746
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:08,832
There is a company anyways has been integrating the echo device

747
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,880
With servicenow

748
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,672
It service management

749
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,256
So that people in the Enterprise can do things like

750
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
Change request

751
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,352
Thought you might find it interesting and something

752
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
How to keep an eye on

753
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
Okay

754
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,168
Heaven

755
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
That's actually a really good idea

756
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,984
And I thought it sounded

757
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
Kevin who's actually

758
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,312
Question does a job

759
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,592
He has actually paid

760
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Answer informed

761
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:39,808
Yes many moons ago I was starting on a technical help desk and a Fortune 100 company and I remember opening

762
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:45,696
Closing service tickets like a maniac well it turns out Kevin from Raleigh mention

763
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
Servicenow

764
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,536
Which has worked with a company called

765
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,096
Decibel apps least based on the research I found

766
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,936
And they have a skill you can say mad at me

767
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:01,568
Ask ticket now to create an incident so basically in the Enterprise if you're on a help desk or

768
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,872
Your tracking any kind of incidents you could

769
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,456
Just create them by voice if you've got echoes in the Enterprise so

770
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:13,856
It's pretty cool skill I know that at the AWS event in November last year they had a hat

771
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Check your office

772
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:19,488
Little party where people trying to create skills for the Enterprise and I don't know if this came out of it or not

773
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:23,584
I know this is available and there is a white paper written on how to create

774
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:30,240
Skills with the Echo and service now so there's probably like a whole market for these kind of things that we probably don't

775
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:35,104
About you often so I'm glad Kevin brought this up cuz I would not know nothing about this I've been wondering

776
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,384
How do we get

777
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,992
These Voice assistance in the Enterprise and this is a perfect example of one way to do it

778
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,320
Easier service tickets and

779
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344

00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,328
He's actually going to explain a lot of things that you're going to want to hear such as

799
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,352
What the heck is happening

800
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,376
Let me talk about AI

801
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
Why Jetson

802
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,752
Is becoming so popular in the industrial iot

803
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,312
Some really cool use cases for

804
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,080
Computer vision

805
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:44,480

835
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,344
Hi Jessie how are you doing today

836
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
I'm doing well how are you

837
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
I'm super excited to talk to you

838
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,952
Because

839
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,304
We have been so focused here at the show on edge computing

840
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,096
Machine learning at the edge

841
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Vision

842
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
Enable and

843
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,936
Feel like in videos

844
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,216
What's going on there

845
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,496
Which is actually

846
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:16,896
Quite unusual from where I thought Nvidia was going to go so let's get started with your main product that you guys are pushing

847
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
4

848
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,480
Computer vision at the edge is that a fair assessment

849
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,248
Maybe it's Prada

850
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,600
I think artificial intelligence at the edge is probably the right Category 2

851
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,184
But this okay so this is a board this is the Jetson

852
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,488
Tx2 is the latest version of

853
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,792
So tell me a little bit about what you guys are doing

854
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,888
Absolutely so it in video where laser focused on artist

855
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,936
Videos of worlds

856
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,984
Leading AI platform and we build

857
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,264
Products to help

858
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,544
Floyd

859
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
Use cases

860
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,360
Now the iot is really

861
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
About computation

862
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,200
Communication and specifically where do you put

863
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
The computation for

864
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
The problem that you're trying to solve

865
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:54,784
Doesn't make sense

866
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,576
The computation or the AI

867
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
In the cloud

868
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Or at the edge

869
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,184
Or somewhere in between in many cases it belongs in the

870
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,024
In the cloud or the data center but there's some use cases where that's just not possible

871
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
Either because of net

872
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
Work van with constraints

873
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
Soar latency

874
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
Privacy

875
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,888
Availability and so

876
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,168
For those use cases

877
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:11,936
They really need

878
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,216
The AI running a

879
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,592
There's two important technologies that Nvidia is building for AISD

880
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,640
Jetson is NVIDIA splat

881
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
AI

882
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:26,016
The Jetson tx2 is a credit card-sized device that runs

883
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
Advanced AI in

884
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,344
10 watts at our customers

885
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,880
Use it in autonomous machines

886
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,416
Like robots and drones

887
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,440
4 manufacturing

888
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
And Logistics

889
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
And further applications

890
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,280
In the industrial internet-of-things like

891
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,304
Predictive maintenance

892
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,888
Now there's also some of these cases where even Jetson is too big and I

893
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,936
Making of the trillions of sensors

894
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,960
Wearables

895
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,752
Mobile devices in these devices

896
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,520
Can still benefit

897
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
From AI

898
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,080
So for these Nvidia has

899
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,104
Deep learning Excel

900
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,664
Or nvdla nvdla is

901
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,432
Hardware

902
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:58,272
Make sure that Nvidia has open sourced to enable companies to benefit

903
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:02,624
From our own AI research and to incorporate this design into their own products

904
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,952
Now we just announced recently that nvdla will be available

905
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
As part of arms

906
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
Trillium

907
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,792
Platform and the partnership makes it simple

908
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,328
Wolf or coyote chip company

909
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,168
Integrate AI into their design so nvdla is new so it hasn't been

910
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:15,936
Corporated antenna

911
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
Products yet with

912
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,496
Exception of some of them.

913
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
Motor Products

914
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,568
So I've been covering in video for

915
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
Decade

916
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,384
And I watched it start

917
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,456
Gpus then go into mobile phone processing fee

918
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,736
The logic was

919
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,528
Does koshka Graphics need to be everywhere

920
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,416
So what tipped you off or got you guys

921
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,440
Thinking about

922
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,256
Creating the smaller profile technology

923
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,584
You correctly stated that are

924
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
Nvidia got its start in

925
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,192
In designing processors cheap used for computer graphic

926
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,496
And as it turned out that highly

927
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
Parallel architecture

928
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,568
For computer graphics

929
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,872
Is also very good for many other testing

930
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,968
Shooting and most recently artificial intelligence now today a lot of

931
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
Intelligence happen

932
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Data Center

933
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
Turn the cloud but

934
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
We realized

935
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
Terminated

936
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,696
Play some of these capabilities out to the network at

937
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:14,048
Automotive self-driving cars was the first example where we really saw it

938
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,096
An important role that vehicle

939
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
Play and help

940
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,424
Bring that technology but of course

941
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
Are there devices

942
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
Microbots

943
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,264
Portable Medical

944
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,056
What devices can all potentially benefit

945
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,616
Artificial intelligence and so

946
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,896
Sort of combining those two

947
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,736
To heritage's the one of Designing highly parallel processor

948
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,016
What can be used for artificial

949
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
Intelligence

950
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,832
And then designing low-power chips

951
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,856
For going into

952
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,160
Mobile products like phones and tablets

953
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
We realized that we

954
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
Could produce something

955
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:46,048
Sing that was almost uniquely qualified to deliver artificial intelligence 2

956
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
Biatch

957
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,864
All right and for people who are maybe less

958
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,472
Differences between training and the computer needs there

959
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Executioner

960
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,824
So maybe I can give a little bit of an example

961
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,176
The first step in modern artificial intelligence and specifically deep learning is training

962
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
A neural network

963
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:07,296
This is when you're showing the neural network many many instances of the things

964
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,344
But you wanted to learn so if you wanted to learn

965
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,648
Aztec people you show it lots of pictures of people

966
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,672
These are people

967
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,976
Or if you wanted to learn to detect cats you should

968
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:15,744
Lots of pictures

969
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
The cat

970
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,560
Are cats and through that process

971
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,352
Of training it learns to distinguish

972
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,120
Patterns

973
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,704
People and cats and whatever else it is that you decide

974
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
It's a train that neural network

975
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,288
Now the result of that training activity is a

976
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,312
The train model

977
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,640
Network which can then be deployed for the second part

978
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,688
Deep learning which is called inference

979
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,528
An inference you're exposing it to new data that it hasn't seen but

980
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,552
Before and it's drawing

981
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,600
Conclusions from that date or drawing inferences

982
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,880
From that day to see you show it

983
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160
A person that it's never seemed

984
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
Warren tells you that

985
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,512
The person who showed a cat that has never seen before and it tells you that that's a cat

986
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,584
Now the training part of this is very very computation

987
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
Ideal you want to be

988
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,400
Running this in a super

989
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:58,752
Computer in the cloud but inference while still computationally intensive

990
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,032
It can be scaled down

991
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
To fit into summer

992
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,336
Edge device

993
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:08,736
Okay and so we were talking about doing inference at the edge where the architectural decisions what do you need

994
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:14,624
Has it turned out good for doing both the train peace and the in

995
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,928
And the reason why that is

996
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,952
When you're training

997
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:23,072
What you're really doing is running the data through the neural network the neural networks spits out and ants

998
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,400
So let's say you show a picture of a cat and it says car

999
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:30,752
Can you say no that's not a car that's a cat go back and readjust your weights

1000
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,776
To an algorithm

1001
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,824
Notice backpropagation and then

1002
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,848
Run the same data

1003
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:38,688
Through the neural network again it through this process eventually at Tunes all the settings

1004
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,248
Network until it can correctly produce the answer

1005
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,808
How many move on to the next image in the next image and so far

1006
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,088
So that first

1007
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,416
Pass that forecast is actually the same thing as in

1008
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,696
Prince's own training are doing

1009
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,488
Fordpass and the backpack

1010
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:55,072
For inference you're only doing the fordpass and so that's why

1011
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
Can you see these architecture

1012
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,912
Is GPU architecture is being replicated for both

1013
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:03,264
Training in a server in the cloud as well as inference out at

1014
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,312
And so to answer your

1015
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,592
Questions to Simply

1016
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,896
You need a general-purpose highly

1017
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:13,760
Parallelize architecture in order to run inference for these neural networks efficiently

1018
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
Okay

1019
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,552
You just don't need it

1020
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Many

1021
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,392
That's correct so inference is one pass

1022
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,696
The neural network

1023
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,256
Where is with training you're doing many many forward passes

1024
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,280
Many many backwards

1025
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,072
And so that's why you need much

1026
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,144
Resources for the training side than you do

1027
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,216
Inference inference is still computationally

1028
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
Complexion

1029
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,008
Is continuing to

1030
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,312
To grow researchers are advancing

1031
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,336
In the research today there

1032
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,360
Designing new

1033
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,408
Neural network designs and the

1034
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,944
Depth and the size of those

1035
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,528
Neural networks is increasing and so in order to keep up with

1036
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,296
Today's

1037
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,856
Research you really need a platform that's

1038
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136
Continuing to in

1039
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
Increase of performance

1040
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,952
Abilities year-over-year

1041
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,256
Okay we're going to talk about that

1042
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,024
When we start talking about

1043
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:01,120
Let's go back to kind of business decisions that invidious

1044
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:06,752
So I originally reached out to you guys because I had heard that the Jetson tx1

1045
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,568
One of the fastest rising

1046
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
From a percentage

1047
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,896
Iot platforms out there

1048
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
Let's talk about what people are

1049
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
Doing

1050
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,760
Sure so

1051
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,808
Jetson is suitable for application

1052
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,600
Where you need a lot of coffee

1053
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
Realize that your

1054
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,696
So for example

1055
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,720
In robotics there

1056
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,744
A big deed for

1057
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
4 AI capabilities but

1058
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,816
It turns out it's really hard to do

1059
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,096
Because you need this massive

1060
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
Amounts of

1061
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,656
Compute in the size and Power on blue

1062
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:39,008
It's typical of these Edge devices like robots in order to optimize

1063
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
Crop yields

1064
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,824
And reduce the use of spray.

1065
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,200
Chemicals Blue River technology uses cameras mounted on tractors to differentiate crops

1066
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,528
From weeds and to deploy treatment only where it's needed

1067
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,808
This allows them to

1068
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
Dramatically

1069
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,112
Reduce the amount of spray can

1070
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,672
Chemicals and the speed at which they can drive the tractor

1071
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,464
Depends on how fast

1072
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
The processor

1073
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:03,584
Process the image so for them Jackson is really critical to productivity

1074
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,120
We also see a lot of

1075
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,168
Work in navigation where robots

1076
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,448
Using AI to low

1077
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:12,032
Localizan navigate like last mile delivery robots made by marble

1078
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,848
Her by Robbie Jetsons also being used to manufacture

1079
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,896
View robotics develops technology

1080
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,432
For collaborative robots

1081
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:22,016
I can work alongside humans and FANUC uses AI for opt

1082
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:25,088
Inspection on its robots

1083
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,928
Consumer drone that can autonomously navigate through complex environments like

1084
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:34,304
Mountains and Forest and Pelt film people's Great Moments so those are all based on AI process

1085
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,584
Video data but

1086
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,888
There's a lot of other applications outside

1087
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,168
Robotics using other types

1088
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:44,032
Update as well one really cool use case is predictive maintenance using anomaly

1089
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,056
Detection on Time series

1090
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,848
So there's this really clever Tech

1091
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
Technique called an auto in

1092
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,432
What you basically train a neural network to in

1093
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,480
Encode and decode a signal coming

1094
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
From this time series data

1095
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,064
Like let's say the current draw

1096
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,088
From a water heater

1097
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
Turn your home now that data

1098
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,744
The current draw is going to change normally over the course of the day and the seasons but if something abnormal

1099
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,304
The encoder won't be able to

1100
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,096
Go to properly because it's never seen it

1101
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,144
And so that's a signal that something

1102
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,424
Abnormal is happening

1103
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
And in many cases

1104
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,984
Is it points to an impending failure

1105
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,032
So the homeowner can schedule

1106
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,104
The water heater breaks another really cool applications

1107
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,408
South Dakota virtual sensor so let's say that

1108
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,248
You really want to build is a redundant fuel flow measurement

1109
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,296
For an aircraft now you know that

1110
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
Fuel consumption

1111
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,368
Is a function of air temperature and pressure in

1112
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,696
Temperature at altitude speed but you don't know exactly what

1113
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,256
You can train a neural network

1114
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,280
On these data and

1115
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,072
Increte what is essentially

1116
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,864
A virtual fuel flow sensor

1117
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
From these other son

1118
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,936
We see Jetson

1119
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,984
Being used for AI at the edge

1120
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,568
A lot of ways that we anticipated but also in a lot of edge application

1121
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
Is that we never really considered

1122
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,384
That's actually really cool

1123
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
Marshall Center

1124
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,735
This reminds me actually of something

1125
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,271
I feel like I hear a lot of

1126
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:03,903
Video examples and I feel like a lot of the big Tech firms are pushing this concept of video at the edge

1127
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:09,023
Show me before finding a parking space that might be monitoring of manufacturing process to understand

1128
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,791
What's going wrong

1129
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,327
I'm curious

1130
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
How you guys feel

1131
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,447
Video versus maybe some of the other sensors out

1132
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,799
Is video always the best option when should you use video over

1133
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
Patterson

1134
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,431
All videos great because it's such a rich sensor

1135
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,735
You're sending 1080p

1136
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:34,111
4K of pixels at 30 frames a second there's just a lot of data

1137
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,951
Which you can infer a lot of things but your point there's a lot of cases

1138
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,719
Video doesn't

1139
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,767
It doesn't work in the dark for instance

1140
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,559
It wouldn't work deep underwater

1141
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:48,191
The same reasons or if you're trying to do things like measure the characteristics of a robot or the water he

1142
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,751
Example that I use video is not going

1143
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,823
There are all of these other sensors out there that are

1144
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,383
Producing data where we think there is a lot of Art

1145
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,151
Opportunity

1146
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,711
To use artificial intelligence to draw insights from

1147
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
That data I think

1148
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:06,111
Exactly as you said most of the research and development is happening on video today because it's such a

1149
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,415
Which sensor but there is also a lot of work

1150
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,719
Getting less attention

1151
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,999
Types of sensors

1152
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,023
And let's

1153
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
About the future

1154
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,095
So as you guys are developing

1155
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,679
It should be ahead of the Curve

1156
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,959
Because my gosh

1157
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,031
It takes a lot longer to build something in silicone then it does and software

1158
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,847
So what are the workloads that you guys

1159
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
Being interesting going

1160
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,199
So what are the things we found in our work

1161
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,991
With Jetson is that Jetsons

1162
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
Incapable of solving

1163
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,295
Many problems

1164
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
Robotics

1165
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:40,671
4 using artificial intelligence at the edge but there are many other

1166
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
Challenges out there the

1167
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,255
Because they demand

1168
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
So much more

1169
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,191
We can deliver today and there's two things that I'm really excited about the We Believe with future Generations will be able to

1170
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,239
To address the first is on the robotic side

1171
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
Automation

1172
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,799
Is already used to manufacture

1173
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,359
It takes so much effort

1174
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
Automated production

1175
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,663
Slime that you only do it

1176
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
Very large

1177
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,991
IPhone for example github

1178
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,295
Tremendous efficiency benefit from automation

1179
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,391
Which might be really Innovative doesn't get that same benefits of

1180
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,415
Cost of stamps

1181
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,207
Say more per unit to manufacture

1182
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,487
Can I take this as a negative

1183
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,511
Impact on innovation

1184
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,535
Robots that can

1185
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,583
Quickly learn to adapt

1186
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
New jobs in

1187
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:23,167
Products could make automation much more flexible

1188
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,703
Introduce the barriers of

1189
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,727
Bringing that

1190
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
Innovation tomorrow

1191
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,031
We believe that with

1192
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Increase comp

1193
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,079
Vegetation coming in the

1194
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,615
The future will be able to take on

1195
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,663
More and more of these Manufacturing

1196
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,455
Logistics tasks that can't yet

1197
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,039
The second thing I'm really excited about is in portable Medical

1198
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
Devices

1199
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,647
Are there so many places in the world that the Physicians don't have good access to

1200
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,439
Technology as I'm really excited about the

1201
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,207
Potential

1202
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,743
Judge has

1203
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,047
Like I care in ultrasound

1204
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
With the Next Generation

1205
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
Processors

1206
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
Capabilities

1207
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,959
Companies will be able to address some of those challenges I also like being

1208
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,751
Surprised by Innovation that I never

1209
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,519
Would have thought of

1210
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,287
The Jetsons

1211
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,895
And I am super excited about this portable medicine idea

1212
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,431
Kind of fun

1213
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,199
I like it

1214
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,015
So let's talk about the ecosystem because

1215
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,575
Boomer type at the internet of things it's not like

1216
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,111
You buy a board and

1217
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,903
You just use it right you've got

1218
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,927
All kinds of stuff

1219
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,719
To have to work with the cloud with

1220
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,255
Various other Edge providers

1221
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,815
So how do you guys work

1222
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,887
Companies maybe it's Microsoft Azure maybe it's Amazon

1223
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,727
AWS maybe it's smaller platforms for the gala

1224
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:33,055
It seems to be very consistent Trend that you have to

1225
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:39,455
Link your boards to other people's clouds and services because a lot of these companies are building these

1226
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
Which devices they're not as Technic

1227
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,063
Yeah I think there's no question that

1228
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
Products made from Jets

1229
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,903
Going to exist in a large

1230
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,927
Ecosystem

1231
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,999
Delivering pay I at

1232
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
Hearts of

1233
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,047
The network topology

1234
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:58,143
I'll give you one example so json is used today in

1235
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,191
Amazon Greengrass platform

1236
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,007
So this is a platform that Amazon has developed to help

1237
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
It's custom

1238
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
Manage Apple

1239
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
Locations for

1240
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,127
The industrial internet-of-things and so Jetson

1241
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,431
Can be deployed out at the edge to manage

1242
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,479
Some of these sensors that you

1243
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,247
Find Floyd

1244
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,527
Coyote

1245
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,087
Run AI workload on them and then manage

1246
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,111
That Jets North at

1247
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,391
Collection of Jetsons

1248
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,207
Through this higher level Amazon Greengrass platform

1249
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,743
And so we see the sort of a

1250
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:30,143
Approach being replicated other areas we believe it's really going to help our customers and their customers to play the technology more

1251
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:33,215
So today working with Amazon eventually at work

1252
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,031
Yeah that's correct so Jetson isn't open

1253
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:41,663
Enable our partners and our customers to integrate their technology

1254
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
West Jackson

1255
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,711
Amazon green grass

1256
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,759
Are the first ones that have been announced in

1257
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,063
We expect many more announcements in the future

1258
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:51,903
And let's just quickly to Circle back to the nvdla stuff

1259
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,439
Because I I saw that

1260
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,743
Announcement and I was really fascinated

1261
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,559
Because I covered the arm Trillium announcement

1262
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:02,655
Just a quick reminder for you guys the arm Trillium is a machine learning

1263
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,679
Architecture

1264
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,239
For the power arm chips

1265
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,519
Too much snot

1266
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,591
Sew-in putting nvdla

1267
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,871
On the arm silica

1268
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,407
What should I take away from that

1269
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,199
At first like all of this small

1270
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,991
Companies that are out there trying to develop

1271
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,271
Really low power

1272
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
Machinery

1273
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:19,807
Green chips

1274
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:23,135
Yeah one of the things that we recognize is that there is this

1275
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,671
Need for artificial

1276
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,207
Intelligence to solve problems

1277
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,487
Xen devices

1278
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,023
That Judson simply dozen

1279
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,327
Now of course we've done lot of

1280
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,351
Research and develop

1281
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:39,007
Machine learning artificial intelligence Hardware here at Nvidia leverage. Hardware ourselves

1282
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,799
But wouldn't it be great if

1283
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,591
Companies can leverage that research

1284
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,639
We've done to solve these problems

1285
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,175
For which Nvidia does not bill

1286
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:50,015
So that's what the nvdla is all about companies can

1287
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:50,783
Can leverage cm

1288
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,807
Nvdla it's been

1289
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,879
Open source the RTL is available for download

1290
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:59,487
People can find it on nvdla. Org and they can design it into their

1291
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,511
Own

1292
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,047
The partnership

1293
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,863
Enables all of arms

1294
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,399
And licensees

1295
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:12,031
The Easley leverage the nvdla technology into their designs and so we expect in the

1296
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,311
In the future you'll see

1297
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,079
Many many

1298
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
Products that are

1299
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
Designed

1300
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
Around

1301
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,711
Architecture and incorporate the nvdla

1302
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,783
Deep learning inference

1303
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,063
Out to all of this

1304
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,087
Tiny iot

1305
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,111
Devices that are off

1306
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,903
2 watt range

1307
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,231
Historically in videos works with a fairly limited number

1308
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
Partners

1309
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,023
Because

1310
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,815
There are only a few server makers out there

1311
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,607
Are there only a few game console makers

1312
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:41,983
So as you advance and start selling these boards how are you guys changing

1313
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:45,311
Cheap because iot is vastly different than any other

1314
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,847
Tech ecosystems

1315
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,639
Yeah that's absolutely

1316
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:52,479
Play cracked I think one of the things that we realized early on with Judson

1317
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,503
Is that

1318
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,783
Instead of having

1319
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
We typically have had

1320
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,879
In the past which is a small number of large customers

1321
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:01,695
In json we have a very large number

1322
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,231
Of relatively smaller

1323
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
So rather than having

1324
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,607
Tens or maybe a hundred large customers now we have thousands

1325
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,471
Ten thousands of small Cuts person so just from a scale perspective it's not possible

1326
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,007
More for us to engage Direct

1327
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,799
Every one of those customers

1328
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:22,687
We realize that in order for Jetson to be successful we had to make everything publicly-available we had to enable

1329
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,783
Whether it's a start-up Warren oh yeah Morgan is garage

1330
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
Need to enable them to go

1331
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,111
From an idea all the way to

1332
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,647
The final product without having

1333
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,695
Ticket on the phone and track somebody down from

1334
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,463
Nvidia

1335
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:40,095
When is thinks we're seeing is now the chip vendors are really getting serious about providing

1336
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,143
Security updates patching

1337
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,471
For the life cycle of some of these embedded products

1338
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:49,311
So we saw Qualcomm do a 7 and 10 year support for their Snapdragon Inn

1339
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,871
Microsoft announced a 10-year support

1340
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,663
With their projects Oprah's security

1341
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,943
Dirty chips so

1342
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,503
With these products the Jetson products

1343
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:02,111
What kind of support are you guys offering today and then what are you kind of looking to do for the

1344
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,695
The future sure we actually think about this into different kind of

1345
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,463
Categories of

1346
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,231
The products

1347
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
We have

1348
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,791
Products that are more commercial

1349
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:14,911
In nature and for those products we support those for five years since the launch

1350
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,959
And so by support that means

1351
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
They're still available

1352
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
Purchase

1353
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,823
You also get software updates from Nvidia

1354
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,383
Which in the beginning will focus on functional and four

1355
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,663
Performance improvements

1356
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,455
Chords to longer life with

1357
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:32,575
The project will include security updates to make sure that any vulnerabilities are being patched

1358
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,599
So five years for

1359
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,903
Commercial now we realize that that's not enough

1360
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,927
For some apps

1361
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:41,023
Locations particularly in industrial use cases customers are demanding

1362
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,303
10 year lifetime

1363
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:46,911
And so for a version of our Jetson tk1

1364
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,935
Base platform

1365
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
And also for

1366
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,495
A product we just announced called

1367
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,799
The Jetson tx2 I we offered

1368
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
10 years

1369
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,335
Of support

1370
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,407
Although this is saddening to me because I have

1371
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,223
I see it's a one-and-a-half-year-old June oven

1372
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,527
With an Invidia this is a Tegra processor

1373
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,135
Oh my gosh I only have three and a half years left on my oven

1374
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
Triple B's

1375
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:08,927
Supported

1376
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:12,767
Alright Jesse thank you so much for coming on the show today

1377
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,047
Thank you very much for having

1378
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:21,215
That's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot

1379
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:27,615
Sign up for my newsletter and Stacey on iot. Cam will see you next week
