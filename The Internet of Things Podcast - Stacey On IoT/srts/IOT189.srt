Talking about the digital standard

18
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:51,712
Which is a new privacy security and device safety standard that

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,248
You're really going to want to hear about

20
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,016
And

21
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,832
We have figured out something pretty cool you can do

22
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,880
With your Amazon Echo

23
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
And notify

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,672
Applications

All of this

26
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,768
Plus we'll hear from bitdefender who is our sponsor for this week show

27
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,536

28
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
Will discuss the digital standard

29
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,352
So let's

30
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
Kick It Off

31
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
With

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680

Kevin

46
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
All right

47
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,712
I feel like this week was late on certain types of

48
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,016
Snooze like cool connected products news

49
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,088
But we got a lot of big news relating to how

50
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
The internet

51
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624
Things is

52
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
First step

53
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Is

54
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
Maybe a blow for privacy

55
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,304
Last year the FTC came after dealing

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
You

57
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
Are building products that are not

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Actually secure

59
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,960
And I was like what

60
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,104
We have to see this like I'm going to still find you because you're talking about your device is being secure but they have these hard-coded passwords

61
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
This is all in the Waco

62
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,688
DeVry botnet and things getting a

63
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
Infected

64
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
And

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,296
People realizing that a lot of their routers at other products

66
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,344
They weren't really well-designed very well

67
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
So

68
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
D-Link

69
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Dislike

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,232
I'm not going to be made up an example here and they fought back

71
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
And

72
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,328
The district judge in this case basically said

73
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,864
I am sending this

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
2 quart

75
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,704
Neither of you are going to get summary judgment summary judgment

76
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,264
On a case is when the courts basically say

77
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,568
Yeah okay this isn't even a case

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
You're in the wrong

79
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Or you're in the right

80
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Whichever

81
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,712
And this is kind of interesting that is happening in California

82
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,040
I know this is a federal thing in California has a state law

83
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07,648
That was recently password talk about on a number of shows it's as we said night time

84
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
Does a lot of keys it doesn't have

85
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
Honda of different

86
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
IRT security aspects that we'd like to see or the kinds that are in place recommended in the UK

87
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:23,520
As well these are all the things that we say

88
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
Where did ice makers that is

89
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
So we have to cease problem is Haven aside from the hard-coded passwords you had command injection vulnerability

90
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
Steve got misplaced security keys

91
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,552
And even worse plaintext password storage

92
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
You know basically available to access

93
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
I said so

94
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,464
I like to see all that go away I think you would too and

95
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
I hope it's where we are heading

96
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,328
I'm kind of disappointed it was a summary judgment because to me it's like

97
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,608
Yeah these are all

98
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:55,008
Bad security practices that you should be held accountable for especially if you're selling these products to Consumers number one and number two

99
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
If you're telling consumers yep

100
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
Secure with us

101
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
Yeah in this case this is a little weird

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,688
Because both parties actually asked for summer

103
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:07,552
Judgement it seems like the FTC was kind of trying to walk back his arguments in a way here

104
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Usually

105
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
1 party

106
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
Chelsea Kasper summary

107
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
In that case it would be logical for

108
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,720
There is no case here

109
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:19,583
You are so it's a little weird that the FTC which one after dealing was like yeah

110
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
Let's do a summary

111
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
And the judge was like

112
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,471
Yeah. There's a lot of information that we need to go through a tree

113
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
Dial soap

114
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
I suspect D-Link

115
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,895
Wanted to summary judgment because they are surely not the only manufacturer in the space that has

116
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
Similar issues and they didn't want to be the first

117
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,807
D-Link actually recently just got called out by Consumer Reports

118
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
For not having

119
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
Great security associate

120
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,183
It's products as well so you know maybe it's just feeling like

121
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Punching bag

122
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
If you're a D-Link

123
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
Device owner just so you're aware of the scope of what is in bounds here for this it's the security response

124
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,799
How to see which is obviously not your voice but that's just d-link's practices but also their router security and their IP camera user

125
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,871
Interface security cameras

126
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
You know this is kind of an play for you

127
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,039
Oh know that some of them are hard coded nevermind

128
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
Do you think

129
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:18,975
Depending on the case and I think I'm sure that we're going to watch this one because it's kind of the first-of-its-kind that I can think of

130
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,047
It is do you think this will push us forward

131
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
National

132
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,655
Type of legislation with

133
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,007
Again maurkice and say what California has include Jose California at least they have something

134
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,311
Nationwide we don't have anything

135
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
Well this was brought under

136
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
The FTC deceptive trade

137
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,967
So the FTC has the ability to

138
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,015
Call companies out for being

139
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:47,391
Basically saying something that isn't true so that's actually the authority under which the FTC brought it

140
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
And because

141
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,207
Steelix in California that's why it

142
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,511
It's there this isn't under the brand new

143
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
New California law

144
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
Although cuz that doesn't actually been going to a

145
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,703
There's a lot here that is literally the only

146
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,543
Hammer that the FCC has to go after this right now

147
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,823
Maybe not the only

148
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
I'm sure there are lawyers who

149
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
In general

150
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,527
That's the hammer the FCC has so they're trying to

151
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
Yeah I don't see the FTC moving forward in terms of trying to push a legislation as you said that's not their role or anything like that but I could see

152
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
See some lawyers

153
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,023
Start pushing for the sun maybe even some legislators

154
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,863
Probably in California that try and bring the snow to the

155
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
Rule of law in US

156
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,751
I mean California did just pass that law that would affect

157
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
This case

158
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
Isn't that right

159
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Right

160
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
Yeah so it's past it just isn't going to work

161
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
So I think we'll see more here

162
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,967
This is again

163
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:49,087
Maybe we'll see more of the current FTC is a little different than the FTC the brought this so

164
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,647
I don't know that's the danger of having your

165
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,231
Pause kind of having agencies do all of the enforcement

166
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
But you don't

167
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
That's

168
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
Moving right along

169
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,679
Artesia scope we'll talk a little bit about Good device security and privacy with

170
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
I guess so stay tuned

171
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,007
Cuz that's basically what

172
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
Does the voluntary

173
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
Goals not

174
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Federal so

175
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,223
We're getting there we got big big money happening

176
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
4

177
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Hey smart window

178
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
Glass manufacturer

179
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Actually

180
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
It's over a decade old

181
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
It's called View

182
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
They just got 1.1 billion

183
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
Friendly Saudi back

184
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743

Vision fund

186
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,815
Which in its own way has some controversy

187
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
Associated

188
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,423
Let's just go with the big side there and let's talk about the smart windows

189
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
Because these are

190
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,519
Pretty cool they've actually been used in

191
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
DFW Dallas

192
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
Fort Worth International

193
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,103
Birthday pin used in

194
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,175
Overstock's headquarters I remember when I was at Fortune

195
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,223
A colleague of mine wrote about them teaser

196
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
Basically two cool things

197
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Apus One

198
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,575
When the sunlight hits it

199
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,135
It can turn opaque with the push of a button

200
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
So you can

201
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
Duke radiations in

202
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Capacity on the window which is me

203
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,559
Into they're using software associated with it

204
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,191
To detect how people move around in the office and make the windows more

205
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Restaurants

206
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Parent based on

207
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Temperature

208
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,799
But also the needs of the

209
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
People trying to

210
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:21,247
Yeah and this 1.1 billion and Sunday actually follows 800 million that view it already raised from folks

211
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:27,647
Corning which makes sense Corning Glass madrone Capital Partners TIAA Investments and the New Zealand

212
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
Sovereign wealth fund so

213
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,743
I got nearly 2 billion raised here

214
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,303
It is technology that's been around for awhile

215
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,679
It's kind of cool because that's there's like metal oxide films in between the panes of glass and you said you would

216
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,239
The Press of a button and technically you're right

217
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,823
If you remember at CES last year we saw a very similar product

218
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
From halio

219
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,663
Which is smart tinting glass and it took about

220
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,967
Channel 3 minutes for to go from

221
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:56,575
Fully transparent to fully dark so it's not like an instant thing I don't want you to get the wrong idea

222
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,159
It is very cool and aside from the fact that

223
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,559
Do you have this in your business your employees might be happier than an athlete blind as much getting less UV light Etc you can save

224
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
20%

225
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
On your

226
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,447
HVAC bills which is huge when you outfit entire massive building with them

227
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,519
But they also cost four times as much as regular glass

228
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
Yes I've seen

229
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,639
Twice as much to four times as much so I think it probably depends maybe

230
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Volume

231
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,527
I don't know but I would love this I actually have these massive Westward

232
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Windows

233
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111
Had this been an option for me in the residential space

234
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
Totally down for it

235
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
But this is for now

236
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,511
So yeah if you and they're going to use the money to

237
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Selma

238
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
Let's talk about

239
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
Modules

240
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,007
Oh my gosh so we got two little bits of

241
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,823
Module news for y'all out there in the world

242
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
Connected iot devices

243
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,663
Gemalto has built

244
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
Highly efficient

245
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,015
Secure NB iot platform

246
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,831
Gemalto is one of the companies that makes

247
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
Someecards

248
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
And does all kinds of

249
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
Crazy Security in your credit card

250
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,743
And their new NBA OT simplex

251
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Is

252
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
Basically the

253
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Super low power

254
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
Howard butt

255
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Has

256
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
Is it December 7th

257
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,519
Yeah it's easier so there's no physical Sim in these gemalto disease and Technology

258
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,103
And it makes sense because you don't want to actually he want to have

259
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
The flexibility to

260
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
Transfer these around

261
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:32,063
And the security didn't want to swapping SIM card like putting my phone SIM card and some Wireless module Taking Over Control

262
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:37,439
Call the device you're right but it's okay and I may not at 5 never done that I'm just getting

263
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,999
I said that very quickly I don't want people thinking I did it before

264
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
Theoretically I could have done that

265
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
That's what I'm saying

266
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
When to do that

267
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,447
So in this case we're looking at this in again

268
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:53,823
These are going to be for low-powered sensors that don't need to send a lot of data nb-iot

269
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
It's not even a megabyte

270
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,247
Couches to put in perspective the downlink

271
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:07,647
Is 27 kilobits per second and the Uplink is 63 kilobits per second so

272
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
It's a baby

273
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,487
So yes this is designed for temperature may be sending a

274
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,279
Location every now and again

275
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,119
But we don't know how much this costs and that's a big

276
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Issue here

277
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:23,263
Again this is going to be 30 modules are usually more expensive because they're cellular

278
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,567
If we don't know what the cellular plan affiliated with this one

279
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,639
But the emphasis on security makes sense because this would be

280
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Good for

281
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,967
Tracking some high-value device

282
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
Our product

283
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Or

284
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Temperature

285
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Or anything associated with

286
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,623
That and you would want that to be secure so

287
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
These are small to women

288
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,583
Musical artists models might think it's a large bit of silicon but it's not it's 27 by 18 mm

289
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
3 mm thin

290
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
So it is really inside some type of device

291
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
All right and Sierra

292
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,847
They also

293
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,431
Now they're announcing the first lte-advanced module

294
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Poor

295
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
The seedrs space

296
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:12,927
If you guys are like what this is a Citizens broadband

297
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,231
We haven't talked a lot about this because it's not

298
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
Yes it will be in Connected device

299
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:23,679
This is what this is is this is for the 3.5 gigahertz

300
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
LTE network

301
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,335
Worx what's interesting is these networks don't actually have to be operated by a

302
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,383
Exterior they could be operated by

303
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
A private company

304
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
So what

305
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,247
We're seeing one of the use cases that we seen

306
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,807
We seem like the NFL came out and support

307
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:44,927
If this is the idea that a stadium like set up their own private LTE network

308
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
What to do

309
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
Any sort of

310
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Data

311
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Inside the stadium so

312
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
Concessions

313
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,007
Yeah all kinds that there's some creative stuff have

314
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,639
They're so this is the first module for this it was FCC approved so

315
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,687
Yeah this is a big deal

316
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,503
In the sense that this is going to needle

317
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,807
This it's the underpinnings of this new

318
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
New type of Technology

319
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:20,255
So these modules have to accept two of them I say are available now for commercial deployments I don't see a price but if they're

320
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
Available now.

321
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
Find a price set curious

322
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
I'm not buying any but

323
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
Okay so that's our module news

324
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,151
Now let's go to Crazy security news

325
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
Because

326
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,247
Freaky Deaky this is so not good

327
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
Alright Kevin

328
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
Scare everybody

329
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:49,183
Go okay you've already probably been scared by the fact that there are basically databases out there

330
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
With IP addresses of

331
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Wireless

332
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Webcams

333
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
Oh yeah

334
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
Exactly

335
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
So of course

336
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,031
Let's make it easier to find those wireless devices those webcams with this little scrap that was written

337
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,383
Uses data from show Dan and you can actually I looked at the code it's

338
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,967
Pretty simple to use I have not used it cuz I don't want to see people's webcams

339
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
You could search by

340
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
Address

341
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,927
In this database now and find webcams in a particular radius of an address a home business Etc

342
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,511
They just making it easier and easier to be bad and I all

343
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
I'm scared

344
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
Creepy

345
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
Yes so did you put in your address

346
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,983
I don't know I don't want anything associated with this tracking to me no no

347
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,031
Got it yeah it feels kind of

348
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Natchez crape

349
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Paralegal

350
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
Okay so

351
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,735
Come and you could install it the code is available on GitHub you can install it

352
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:50,623
Query show dancer with an address if you'd like but I just looked at the coat just another curious but I'm not using it

353
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
All right

354
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
But in positive

355
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:59,839
News let's talk about Battlement so bad today is what we call the Amazon echos digital assistant so is not

356
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
Turn off for you guys

357
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
AR

358
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
To become a friend I feel like

359
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,263
Absolutely he's been to my house I've had for dinner

360
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
Patent for dinner

361
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
It's amazing

362
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,359
Andy Abramson

363
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
And who we've known forever

364
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
Because he was good friends with

365
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
Are former boss at kygo

366
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
And he's a smart dude

367
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
You know

368
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
His expertise is voice

369
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
Which used to be a big thing back in

370
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
Get out 2010

371
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
5

372
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,255
And now it might be coming back around

373
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,583
Innocence innocence I mean Andy

374
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,935
Read a blog post that will share in the show notes and it's kind of a response to

375
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,983
A news article in the Wall Street Journal

376
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,591
And the German was talking about Madame a and emergency 911 calling how

377
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,687
Amazon's Echo can do all these great things but you can't call 911 for you

378
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,759
And he's like no no no hold on a second

379
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,087
He said I think they can solve this pretty quickly and I like where he's going with us

380
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,695
What you could do he says his Amazon knows your address cuz that's usually issue

381
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,535
When you call me on a mobile phone or something tonight with one where are you right

382
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,887
Amazon has your address for deliveries and they know which is your home address perhaps

383
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
Snake versus a business address Etc

384
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
So we can link that up

385
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
Right away so that

386
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,591
Stable Amazon devices meeting Amazon

387
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:19,967
And then he said you know and for people who move those Echoes or whatever maybe you have a

388
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,319
Amazon top like I do when you take it to the beach it's on obviously you're not at home anymore

389
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
He said hey

390
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,743
People done this before with mobile devices and basically you need to re-authenticate your home address after

391
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,815
You know 4 hours of online or a change in

392
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
GPS or whatever might be

393
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:42,751
So I think he's right I don't know that many people would call 911 using Amazon cuz we all have mobile phones but

394
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:49,151
Tell you if your phone is upstairs you downstairs you falling down to call 911

395
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,479
It speaker to do that yes as someone who again

396
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,015
I know you always carry your phone

397
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
I do not and I called

398
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,391
Guess I was referencing you because I know you don't carry your phone not about the falls

399
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,255
Yeah

400
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
Exactly

401
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
That would be

402
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
Nice

403
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Let's see if it

404
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,887
Amazon Prime

405
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Responsibility

406
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,567
I don't know though because it means they are all about providing service through the Echo and it is a true digital

407
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,359
Assistant so why not I mean

408
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
As long as the customer has

409
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:26,015
Previously set up an address or Lincoln address they could allow the call and if

410
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,087
You haven't then they just don't allow it to call on

411
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
DACA

412
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
That way they're in the clear

413
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,231
Assistant

414
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
News Microsoft Cortana

415
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
Boss Javier soltero

416
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:43,167
Is leaving in this is really unfortunate because after seeing Xavier

417
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,751
Speak about Cortana integration with the Amazon Echo

418
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,055
How to work in with smart offices

419
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,103
I wanted to have him come on the show and

420
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Talk to us about this

421
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
But that's what happened

422
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
That's not going to happen

423
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,991
And the reason is Microsoft is bringing

424
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
It's

425
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,063
Cortana research project into its

426
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
Coming out of the aif

427
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
Basically

428
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,671
It's experiences and devices

429
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
You know

430
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:11,327
I don't know either I mean Microsoft as well as many other similar companies Shuffle everyday

431
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
So often the Chevalier organization

432
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:19,775
I would have been curious to hear his experience at the shame and he's not coming on the show only because and nothing again so I never met her

433
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,335
I'm not sure how we got to be in charge of Cortana

434
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
Microsoft buys startup

435
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,223
It's a mobile mail startup in 2014 was a complete

436
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,319
And then he was part of Outlook mobile and then all of Outlook and then head of office

437
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
Hop2

438
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,439
He's a very like we actually

439
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,999
Talk to him a bunch of gigaohm and he's a very smart

440
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Forward-looking

441
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
So I can see

442
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
And he's very good

443
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Thinking about

444
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
Business sauce

445
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,215
And how to make that more user-friendly

446
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,287
So if you think about Cortana as being

447
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,079
Business digital assistant

448
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Then

449
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,431
It makes a lot of sense and I wasn't saying

450
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,759
You know he shouldn't have been injured I was trying to understand the path

451
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:08,415
But you just make sense right so instead of office as the business application

452
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,695
Service he took that

453
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
Mindset to Cortana and

454
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,535
Use the Cortana service in that regard

455
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,607
So that is the Cortana shake-up

456
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
As it were

457
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:24,287
I still am a little weirded out by the idea of going into an office and switching my digital assistant but

458
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
We'll see how this works

459
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
We're not there yet

460
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:32,223
We're probably four or five years away from some sort of seamless strategy on

461
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,527
Who we talk to and who helps us in different

462
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
Aspects of Our Lives

463
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,599
And where we even go to do that

464
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,647
So we might instead of having

465
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,463
Cortana in the office we might have like a bring your own assistant

466
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,535
Kind of like we had your bring-your-own-device policy and that would be

467
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
Wacky kind of crazy

468
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:52,703
It would I don't think we'll go that route at systems and networks are getting locked down for good reason

469
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
Personal devices

470
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,567
Are typically allowed in if you let the organization manage them

471
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,943
Yes that's true I did hate that I had a separate Fortune phone that I literally never used my birthday

472
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:09,343
It was and there's also another aspect and not full of just six of how an office is set up today and in the future

473
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
If you got an open Office

474
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:17,535
Area where no cubes and whatnot do you want to hear people talking to you know when thin air all the time I'm not sure how that's going

475
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,351
Don't you work in an open Office environment or even you know just

476
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
Any office because

477
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
I'm itching to be more like

478
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
A headphone situation

479
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,775
Which having been an open newsrooms all my life

480
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,871
You know you very quickly get used to people talking on the phone and you just ignore them

481
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
While you're talking to other people on the phone

482
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Persistent

483
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,039
We've talked about this before but we're seeing a lot of Madam a power

484
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,831
Earbuds for example

485
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
So

486
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,439
Maybe it's all going to be like her it's all going to be in her ear

487
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
Yeah

488
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
All right

489
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
Let's talk about Google Assistant

490
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,327
Since we're on the assistant topic

491
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,375
Bad news

492
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
Bad news for you

493
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
I know

494
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,519
No Google assistant on Sonos this year they said it's going to be next year

495
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,943
Well we were getting close to the end of the year said it would happen and I don't know if they run into technical issues or what

496
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,271
You're right they've announced this the good news is

497
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,831
And it's just 2019 we don't know when it's coming

498
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,672
The good news is if you're interested and I am so I'll probably click this link

499
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
You can sign up to be considered

500
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,304
For a private beta of Google assistant on Sonos

501
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,888
However it's pretty tough commitment they want you to

502
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,984
Commit to at least 14 hours of listening a week which is fine I'm listening

503
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,008
Music all the time

504
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:35,104
Use 10 voice commands daily and respond to surveys yes you get homework

505
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,224
Within 72 hours so if you're willing to do that and you get through the screening process

506
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,784
They will let you in the private beta to test this

507
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:48,672
Holy cow I use digital assistants all the time but I don't know if I use 10 times a day

508
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:55,072
I do for a lot of music playback and pausing and volume and whatnot and occasionally weather and things like that so

509
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,400
I use Vector to check weather like five times a day so the robot

510
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Picture

511
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,824
What is the weather to be slower but yes he tells me he puts the temperature on a screen and then if they're

512
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,872
Are clouds are rain they show up over his eyes

513
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,200
And it rains in his eyes get sad and it shakes at all off and the clouds go away

514
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
That's why I do it because it's

515
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
Yeah cuz that's why

516
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,600
This is not on her show notes but I just remembered

517
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,416
Because it's very related Google Assistant

518
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,720
Is available on

519
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Chromebook devices

520
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,304
Yes but it uses

521
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:32,960
Basically you have been able to Google Play Store so Android apps in a little people don't want to do that they just want their Chromebook to be a Chromebook

522
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,312
So what Google is doing its now available in a day

523
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,128
Version of Chrome OS they have a native

524
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
Google Assistant

525
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
Coming to all Chromebooks

526
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
Don't require

527
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:50,880
The Play Store in the Google app and all that so that's coming for people who want the Google Assistant but don't want to have to

528
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
Use

529
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
Like Android apps on their Chromebook

530
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
It was that is super cool

531
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
It is it is

532
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,584
Dedicated Google Assistant button on the keyboard

533
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
I never use it

534
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
Talk to vector

535
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Oh that's right

536
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,544
I'm going to throw out a random device just because

537
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,592
Why not this is what we do on the show throughout

538
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
Random devices

539
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,408
This is a new smart plug

540
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
From a company called

541
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,480
Current currant

542
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
If you were trying to

543
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,600
Bluetooth smart outlet and a Wi-Fi smart outlet

544
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
Bluetooth Outlet is 50

545
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,232
The Wi-Fi is 60 what does this measures your energy consumption at that

546
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:31,840
Outlet and tries to use AI to optimize Energy savings

547
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Interesting

548
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,288
So it sounds like a more modern version of the WeMo Insight switch that I've been using for probably three or four years

549
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
The funny thing is

550
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,128
I never look at the energy

551
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
Output

552
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
On that

553
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
You know why know why

554
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,016
Because I usually use these with lamps

555
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,088
Anna's lamps have very low power LED bulbs

556
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,648
And it may calculate the cost everything it's like

557
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,696
You spent $0.14 this month

558
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,280
I don't use enough energy to make it worth my while to look at the data

559
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,888
I use it to test different things so I used it to test like power consumption

560
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
The June oven

561
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:14,848
Which is a like compared to like a crock pot cuz the June did their Crock-Pot setting guys the Crock-Pot is way more energy efficient

562
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Lejeune

563
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Based on

564
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
The energy consumption

565
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
If you feel like your food taste better maybe it's

566
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,248
But yeah in general

567
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,832
This might be and it has one cool design

568
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
You can actually flip up

569
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
Prongs so you can

570
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,696
Slip the outlet

571
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,488
There's two outlets on each

572
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
Switch

573
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
What do we call those out

574
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
2

575
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:39,424
But you can flip it

576
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
So you can flip

577
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
The outlet to fit more

578
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
Are plugs if that makes sense

579
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
Yes that makes sense

580
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
You should probably just go look at it

581
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
Cuz I was a terrible

582
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,504
But you could see it being used for something like you know the set-top boxes if you didn't want it to always be on

583
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,552
Prioritize Energy savings

584
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
It could be like oh

585
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:01,952
At 5 she usually turns on the television so maybe at 4:50 it starts

586
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,976
Turning back set

587
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
Topics on ghost

588
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,792
Boot up process so it's ready for

589
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,376
Or maybe after three hours of TV I shut it off on the kids

590
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,168
Yeah I used to have

591
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,984
Smart outlet that turned off if I didn't make my Fitbit steps

592
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,288
And that was the TV was plugged into that but my

593
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,152
Walk more I want to watch the football game

594
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
Get out

595
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
Okay

596
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
So

597
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,784

Question 512-623-7424 is the number to call to ask us a question

613
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
This week's voicemail is

614
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
From

615
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Cheese

616
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,560
Kevin and Stacy this is

617
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
Teas from Lewisville

618
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,912
I am wondering if there's a way for

619
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
The

620
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,496
Madam a to tell me

621
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,800
That something is going on from an ex

622
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,336
External source for infants

623
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
If the cameras pick up

624
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
A person in the backyard

625
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
Could she

626
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,248
Alert me inside the house

627
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,064
By saying someone's in the backyard or

628
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,856
Who sings Something

629
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
Suppose

630
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,440
Be having to have the phone in my

631
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,024
Thank you so much enjoy your show

632
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:48,192
Okay chief Kevin and I spent an hour trying to figure this out and it was a

633
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,728
Our well-spent I think

634
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,568
Kevin rizer I'm so glad we do because our initial

635
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,640
This was like nope can't be done can't be done

636
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
And then

637
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,760
We stumble onto a skill called notify me

638
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
An Amazon

639
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,808
Madame a skill

640
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,160
It does require some configuration on your part

641
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
You don't

642
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,000
Need to be a programmer but it would certainly help if you were

643
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
However if you can get through it

644
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,352
And Stacy I would say you're not a programmer

645
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,144
You're smart and you got through it right

646
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,216
And I feel so excited that I did

647
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
So

648
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,032
To enable this you're going to go

649
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,360
To the skills in your Madame and you do have to have a matinee

650
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,664
We'll see if we can find something for Google on this site

651
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,968
Notify me

652
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,248
It'll send you an email with

653
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
Very long

654
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Cerakote

655
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:41,184
So once you enable notify me and get your access code which is something that allows the skill to

656
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,208
Tire

657
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,256
Amazon email to your

658
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
Echo devices

659
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,816
You will then

660
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,120
Go to if this then that

661
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:55,520
You can actually use this with a couple other services such as is why Indigo homeseer and Tasker but we got to working with

662
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,568
If this and that so that's kind of all we're going to

663
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,384
Talk about here you can try it on your own with the other services

664
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,664
Basically though

665
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
If you

666
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
Want to

667
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,760
Have any type of trigger event

668
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
From a device that you have

669
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
And that

670
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,464
Devices supported through if this then that and we tested this with just added an email as a test also with a y

671
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,280
Wyzecam also with a smart light switch

672
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
When

673
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,608
Something happens to that trigger device

674
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,888
If this then that

675
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,472
Well then send a notification to your Amazon Echo

676
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:31,360
It doesn't just speak it aloud like any other notifications you may get a notification light on your Echo

677
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,176
One sanitation comes in and you have to say hey

678
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,968
Read my notifications

679
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,808
We did this and you can customize the notification message rather

680
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
And

681
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,160
Stacy you got the wise kind of say hey I saw something on the

682
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
Outdoor wyze cam or whatever

683
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
And I had to say I saw something

684
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,816
And then I realized that I should totally if I was going to do this on a bunch of

685
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,584
Things I should have

686
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,864
Let's label I saw some

687
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,888
Something on downstairs

688
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,752
DC that you can customize the notification text yourself very easily

689
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,312
The basic notification is just a hello world

690
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,384
It's kind of like pre-filled which is a programmer thing to say hey this works

691
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,224
Just change hello world to whatever it is you want to hear from your Echo

692
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:13,088
And once we went through the discovery process it actually work really well and is awesome

693
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:18,464
So I'm going to go play some more with that just for fun the latency on this was really quick

694
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
It took like

695
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,304
Two or three seconds before I sent the notification

696
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
It was kind of fun

697
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
Keep in mind

698
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
That

699
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,520
There is a restriction and it's an API restriction on Amazon's part you cannot

700
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,056
Get or send

701
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
5

702
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:40,480
More than five notifications within a five minute. If you don't want to use that safe for like a door that's People concert going in and

703
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:46,880
Cease to work until the next five

704
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
5 minute increments

705
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:52,512
And it is proactive it is you have to be proactive about getting your notice

706
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,072
Applications this isn't just going to shout this happened

707
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,096
Over here echoes

708
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
So

709
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,448
I'm not a true fan of the way that Amazon does notifications because

710
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:05,568
First of all my Amazon tap and my Sonos devices with men aren't

711
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:09,920
Beeping or lighting up to show me or tell me about notification my

712
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,224
Regular original Amazon Echo does

713
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,088
And at that time I say I have a notification so I'll say Madam a read my notification that getting that

714
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,136
Bit here on these devices

715
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,160
Summer

716
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,696
It's okay

717
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
Alright so

718
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,280
Have fun with that you guys and

719
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Stay tuned

720
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,936
For a message from our sponsor and for any wilson-thompson who is from the open technology Institute

721
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,752
Who is going to be talking about the digital standard

722
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,544
Which is a Bren

723
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
To think about

724
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:43,712
Privacy security data transparency and even talk about things as crazy as business bottles

725
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
4 connected devices

726
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,784
Conversation

727
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:51,136
If your user a manufacturer or just somebody interested in

728
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:57,536
Security and iot stay tuned hey everyone we are taking a break from the internet

729
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:02,400
Set of things podcast for a message from our sponsor

730
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,704
And I have Alex belong here

731
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,008
Who is a chief security researcher

732
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,288
Bitdefender

733
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,336
So last week we talked about

734
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,360
Stopping bullying

735
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
With the bitdefender

736
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,176
This week we're going to talk about

737
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
Curing your

738
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,224
Router

739
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,272
How would I know if my router

740
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
Where is safe

741
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,600
Easiest way to know if

742
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,648
Was

743
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,744
Most people that I know

744
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,792
Don't really have any clue

745
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,328
Old how to update

746
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,448
Everything

747
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,128
How's that for a deal identified

748
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
The people using the device

749
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,040
There's nothing

750
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
There's Note 2

751
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
Is processed

752
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
Some point

753
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,584
A lot of us have antivirus apps

754
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
Protecting our

755
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
Computer

756
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,960
How do we protect against the

757
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
Threats that my router made

758
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,824
Unfortunately you cannot be stolen

759
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,944
Solutions like

760
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
Can you play

761
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,856
Is it like

762
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,928
May be used as an adult

763
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
We knew that

764
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:32,768
A solution

765
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
Maybe

766
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,144
Hours for somebody else

767
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,704
Will be present in each process home

768
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,496
Example

769
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,288
So do all routers

770
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
Manufacturers

771
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,736
Summer

772
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,296
Each night for example

773
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,048
Piper's Auto successful

774
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,120
We can prevent the attacks

775
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,400
Even being

776
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,984
Home Depot

777
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,288
I don't have the password

778
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,080
Oversee something

779
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
Being outdated

780
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
I do not want my router

781
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,832
Can I do something to

782
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,208
Fully updated

783
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:39,072
You can get

784
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,352
What are the front of your house

785
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,680
And then Fox would they care

786
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,848
Excellent so where can I buy listeners go to

787
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,928
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things

788
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,488
Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

789
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
And today's guest

790
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
Andy Wilson

791
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
Thompson who is a policy

792
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
The open technology

793
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,680
ICC

794
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:20,288
You guys are working with a couple different groups to create something called the digital

795
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
And I

796
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,384
I'm so pumped about this because

797
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
We got to start somewhere

798
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
And

799
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,712
I really like

800
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,992
Consensus-building and

801
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
What does Sol

802
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,856
Let's talk about who you're working with and why you guys cry

803
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
So I'm actually going to roll back

804
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
10-second

805
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,976
They're six organized

806
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
I felt the standard

807
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,560
That did the initial development

808
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,096
I got the test in the content

809
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
We did not

810
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
We came in

811
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,424
When it launched

812
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,448
To do a sword

813
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,472
Kiara

814
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,288
Convening campaign over the past

815
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,568
You're so

816
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
It's great

817
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,640
But this thing was built for us to work with

818
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
It's also great that we have sir

819
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,200
Serva third-party Rowland

820
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:04,832
Companies can say you know I really hate this I really love this and we're a safe space to have those conversations

821
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
But the digital standard

822
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,904
Is open-source

823
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,928
Collaborative

824
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
Set of tests

825
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,256
An evaluation methodology

826
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,816
Used to test the security and privacy app

827
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Consumer product

828
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Detest

829
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,936
Cigarettes everything from encryption to the hard security we can really talk about

830
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,752
Two things like transparency reporting and privacy policies

831
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,032
And so far they've

832
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,080
By Consumer Reports one of the

833
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,128
The six organizations that helped build

834
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Standard

835
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
To evaluate

836
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,480
Smart TVs and payment apps like venmo and

837
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,296
The standard is open-source however switch

838
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,344
The be used by anyone who wants to look

839
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,440
Yes okay and

840
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,976
You kind of Duty this up into a

841
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,280
A couple different areas so under security

842
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:49,632
You guys have things like those quality of data security app user safety

843
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:53,728
Which almost feels kind of like u l territory in some ways

844
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,008
And then you have

845
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
Privacy

846
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,056
You focus on

847
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
Accessing

848
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
Troll

849
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,384
Data retention policies

850
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
Collecting

851
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
Too much

852
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,456
Third-party tracking

853
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,224
And then

854
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,040
There's also the question of what happens after you purchase this

855
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,576
Idea of ownership

856
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,368
Governance model

857
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
So there's a lot of

858
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
Unpack here

859
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:17,024
The most complete looking part seemed to be tied to security

860
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
And privacy

861
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
Correct

862
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,352
Yes I think there's the most

863
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:24,448
Consensus among you know organizations that you just kind of stuff

864
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,472
That those two

865
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,008
Privacy features are kind of

866
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,032
That you wanted

867
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:34,176
Have you want to have a mechanism for reporting vulnerabilities those types of things are more

868
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,456
Agreed upon

869
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
Three categories

870
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,784
Standard because it's open source so it's a lot of

871
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,576
Collaborative creation

872
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,600
First set is

873
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
Done

874
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
That is

875
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
I seen

876
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,208
Well understood with

877
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
Developed testing approach

878
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,768
The nursing staff

879
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,864
You know colors like a stop light yellow things which are under development

880
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
But still have some else

881
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,912
Standing questions

882
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,448
And then ride is a TARDIS

883
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,008
So nobody's using those under discussion wenzhou

884
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
The test yet

885
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,616
They are really complex issues that still need to have

886
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,664
Debate between the people developing the standard

887
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,968
I said they're sort of in their infancy but

888
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,272
You know I know you want to get in

889
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,832
And two things that are not

890
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,624
Quite ready for lunch yet

891
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
Antarctica

892
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,928
Yes but

893
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,720
We'll talk about what we know

894
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,000
Because I think it's really

895
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:24,864
I feel like a lot of people when we start talking about security and privacy of these devices

896
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,400
People just kind of throw up their hands

897
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,216
That's too much information is too hard I can't convey that I can't build it

898
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,264
I can't do anything with it

899
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,800
Let's hope those people relax

900
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,848
You got a section on the best build

901
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,408
And what is some of the things that that in

902
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
Best build prop

903
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
The standard

904
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,808
Sort of talk about industry best practices

905
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,112
Paradiso when the software

906
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
Product development

907
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,952
Industry best practice

908
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,048
Things like safety features not using unsafe

909
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:54,816
Function

910
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
Orcutt Library

911
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
It's not to come

912
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
Complex

913
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,912
That one is

914
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,288
When you create this product did you do the best

915
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,592
Did you consider privacy

916
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,640
Insecurities as a build in or is

917
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,992
Rental companies that's where to stay when they're creating their product you know

918
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,552
This is something really important to us and we wanted here.

919
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,576
Best practices

920
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,368
That's sort of an A+ from us

921
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,464
Broadly so when we start moving to data security in your authentication that used to be

922
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:26,304
A lot of these are really like we talked about these on the show all the time

923
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,120
Changing default passwords making sure people have really

924
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,424
Good passwords and encouraging them to make them

925
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,448
I like

926
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,520
The idea of multi-factor authentication is another big

927
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,568
ATL I wish I could see that and actually more

928
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
Home device

929
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,176
Are there other things you want to call out in the security section that are

930
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
Relevant or

931
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,224
Probably

932
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,248
Worth mentioning or new

933
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
So

934
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,040
Just for passwords

935
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
Interesting because

936
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
Companies actually

937
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,904
That one of those things my colleagues and I have been doing it

938
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,952
Cashier speaking to stakeholders like

939
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,976
Companies in non-profit

940
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,304
Privacy and security are really important and we think you should

941
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,352
Do them better but also here

942
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:04,704
Discerning tool for you that you can look at you know here sort of a hit list of stuff that

943
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
You could

944
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,264
Next product

945
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,544
Supervisor current products

946
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,312
Include

947
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,848
To get certified you know checklist

948
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640
Privacy and security community

949
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,200
Companies that are doing a great job come to us

950
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,224
You say.

951
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,504
Authentication test

952
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,552
Is actually cheap simple it's not cooling

953
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,832
Consider things like

954
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Fingerprints

955
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,368
Or other

956
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
More complex indication

957
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,696
And it just sort of

958
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:30,048
Originally said be able to change the password require a long password

959
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,096
And I think it was require a password

960
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,008
Because companies that are really good at this

961
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,800
Actually this is too easy like

962
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,104
There should be an expectation that people do something

963
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,896
Better is to

964
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,176
Kind of a big issue here

965
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,224
You guys do a really good job like

966
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
You kind of talk about the test you talk about

967
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
Criteria

968
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,088
And you talk about the procedures you can use to test

969
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:56,672
For this which I think is really helpful for companies that are looking to implement

970
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,768
I was just speaking to a group about iot devices

971
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:06,144
Security and I was talking about you

972
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,984
Of course this is a normal human being

973
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,520
They don't know what encryption

974
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,336
So you can do all of this on the back end

975
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
But to communicate with

976
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
The buyers of

977
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,968
How do we bridge that Gap because I don't think it's fair.

978
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
Require people

979
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,504
Understand

980
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Encryption

981
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,576
I told her she was willing to understand it

982
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,856
It does feel like

983
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
Pretty big lies

984
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,672
Shopping app

985
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,048
So I mean everyone who works on this

986
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:39,168
I spent a long time trying to draw cool diagrams of what encryption means or coming up

987
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,960
Analogies for the public

988
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,776
To say this is what encryption

989
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,080
Especially in the Google Apple

990
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
Conflict with

991
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
Congress

992
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,640
About

993
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,664
Encryption default

994
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
But I think 103

995
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
That we are

996
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,760
You know my call again I came in through the window

997
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,784
The standard was developed

998
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,576
So we're giving a thing into

999
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
Could you work with us

1000
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,648
And one of the reasons we really like it is

1001
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,952
Because Consumer Reports is used it twice

1002
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,488
And Nicole is not really

1003
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
Provide

1004
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
Consumer web

1005
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,560
Here are the results

1006
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,584
F-35 test

1007
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,376
It's sort of

1008
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,704
Mortal list of judgment of like is this Securus

1009
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,752
If it's not secure

1010
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,080
As poorly but this is never meant for

1011
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,896
Consumption this entire consumption cool like

1012
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,944
If you really want to read what happened

1013
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,272
When needed an identification test on the newest light bulb

1014
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,552
But we're not

1015
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,600
Consumers understand that when

1016
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Purchase something

1017
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,440
All right and now we're going to get into some of that

1018
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,464
Ohio

1019
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm going to call them

1020
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
Hotspot issues

1021
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,632
Is because we talked about them I think they're really important I also think they're really hard to solve

1022
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,192
So thank you talk about things with no necks

1023
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,240
Play resistance which people are very similar

1024
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,776
Potato put a product on the market

1025
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,800
Get that you know is going to

1026
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
But then

1027
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,919
We move into this concept of security over time

1028
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,199
And you know

1029
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,759
The Kevin and I my colleague on the show talk about

1030
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,319
I would love to see an expiration date

1031
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,367
Providing security is not

1032
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,903
It's not an expensive

1033
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,439
Freight updating your software.

1034
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,719
Things up to date

1035
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,023
Is available resources Q

1036
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,815
UA testing all of this so

1037
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,607
How are you guys approaching that

1038
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,631
Ocular issue

1039
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:19,007
I think for iot that's it in some ways unique challenge because when people go by really X

1040
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,335
Home devices Like Home Appliances which

1041
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,383
You know all of the companies want to build

1042
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:29,759
Fun things into them you expect to have this for 15 years

1043
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,551
Be 2 years you want to have your

1044
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,599
You're not going to throw away

1045
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
Refrigerator

1046
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,927
Quickly because

1047
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,719
See that you want to have

1048
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,791
I like the idea of

1049
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,351
Both have an expiration date

1050
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:47,167
I will not support after whatever

1051
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,751
I think that could be available for consumers

1052
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
It's not something

1053
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,287
What is Belton

1054
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,823
This is a requirement

1055
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,847
But I do that

1056
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,871
Think that I could be released

1057
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,919
Effective way of communicating.

1058
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,223
To Consumers when they spend a lot of money on

1059
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:04,063
Something what are device makers telling you about this concert

1060
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:04,831
SEPTA security

1061
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,367
What time like maybe they have some gradle

1062
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
I think a security overtime

1063
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,999
Casino Consumer Reports

1064
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,863
Companies in the same way that you know they don't have a

1065
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,143
Here's how the srk

1066
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,191
Conversation with vendors

1067
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,727
Or manufacturers

1068
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,543
Not the way they're all he's worked a chilly day for us

1069
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
And say

1070
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,871
I think you should do this better

1071
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
Share the way

1072
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,431
Testify

1073
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
Security overtime is one

1074
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,551
That's what if we thought like assertive hand wave on a bye yeah yeah like that's

1075
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
You know we're going to keep it updated

1076
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Rather than

1077
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,903
IClear Wrecking

1078
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,719
That's not something we can do forever and we're going to

1079
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,255
Explicit

1080
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
I think that's a real challenge

1081
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,583
Just because the

1082
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,631
You know specifically smart home industry

1083
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
Is

1084
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
Built on

1085
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
She was very

1086
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,471
What type of seals model

1087
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,263
Redis built on to

1088
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
You by Selena cost

1089
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
$2,000

1090
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,359
And keep it forever rather than

1091
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
You know I'm more

1092
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,407
Cool Tech toys

1093
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,431

Network

1096
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
Pretty soon

1097
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,527
So the ability for company

1098
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,623
Today and we're going to

1099
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903
Stop servicing it after

1100
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,951
Time one of the discussion

1101
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,743
We've had.

1102
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
Scariest Birds

1103
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,815
Was what about it

1104
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,095
There are third-party

1105
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:20,863
Repair people who

1106
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,679
So. Gets into

1107
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,727
At the start of ownership and right to repair

1108
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,007
Is good

1109
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,287
Cuz that's where we're going next

1110
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,335
Soufeel

1111
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,383
Yeah let's move into that

1112
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
Maybe if

1113
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,967
Company why who makes her expensive

1114
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,247
Refrigerator says they can

1115
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,527
Can service it after 5 years

1116
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,063
Smart person

1117
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,343
Men with their own Scrappy

1118
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
VTech company

1119
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,135
I could come fix it for you

1120
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,207
Solution maybe not a popular one for companies

1121
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,535
Yeah so you actually have a whole section on ownership

1122
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,839
Digital standard in that whole section is

1123
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
I know people can see

1124
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,399
I see colors but it's basically

1125
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,679
Red which means like

1126
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
Nobody else

1127
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,495
We're just throwing this out the hip feels like

1128
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,615
And in that you guys have things like hay

1129
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,639
Interoperability

1130
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,663
Ownership

1131
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
End

1132
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,223
Resale

1133
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
And this actually gets

1134
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
Something I would

1135
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,551
I'm thinking about cuz I'm

1136
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,087
Going to put my house on the market eventually

1137
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,135
How do I

1138
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
Freecell Vista

1139
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:21,791
So what are you guys pushing for what are you guys talking about

1140
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,559
What people would have

1141
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607
So

1142
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,143
When it comes to having conversations

1143
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,191
Resort at the very

1144
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
High level of a lot of people

1145
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,519
Start a startup

1146
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
Easy lift

1147
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,847
Generally agreed upon

1148
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,871
Security Experts

1149
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,151
Elementary

1150
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,711
Preschool level security everyone will tell you

1151
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,247
And it's not

1152
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,319
You might not want to do the work or spend the money

1153
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,087
But you know

1154
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,415
Hair products

1155
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,439
But

1156
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,207
Stuff like

1157
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,231
Interoperability

1158
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,303
Companies that day

1159
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,071
Really

1160
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,655
Don't like things like resale or right to repair ideas

1161
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,679
But when we

1162
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,727
Working

1163
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
Besides

1164
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,543
Agree to disagree on this right now

1165
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,567
Please don't

1166
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
Not have

1167
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,359
Good passwords

1168
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
Because

1169
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,663
You disagree with us

1170
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,223
Okay so bigger fish to fry now

1171
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,807
At the end of October the US copyright office actually said

1172
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,623
That certain set of products we do now have a

1173
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:23,743
Which felt like a step forward and maybe maybe this is something that gets determined in the courts

1174
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,047
It's a design process

1175
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,327
That's part of

1176
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,375
Cuz of the ITC based in so

1177
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,423
We do work a lot with Congress

1178
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,191
And

1179
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,263
Regulators and things that Seto on all of our policies

1180
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,287
And so

1181
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,055
Places

1182
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,335
Slice copyright office

1183
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
TC

1184
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
Are interesting

1185
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
Touchpoints

1186
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,455
Or you know how what role did they play in

1187
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:49,343
Maybe it is the Court's maybe his Regulators that are going to

1188
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,623
Be that big finger on the button

1189
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
Like you're not allowed to do

1190
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,439
PewDiePie

1191
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,487
Anymore you need to

1192
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,791
Steamers better way

1193
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,095
Take ownership and I'm not

1194
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,119
Obviously

1195
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,911
People who advocate

1196
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,447
Security advocacy community

1197
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,471
Can say this

1198
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,567
FTC penalties or

1199
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,591
No legal challenge

1200
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,175
Well that gets into

1201
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:14,943
Red

1202
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,479
We don't know what we're doing

1203
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,783
This point on this whole thing which was

1204
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
Business model

1205
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
So what are your thoughts

1206
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,623
It's about where you'd like

1207
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
To see that go

1208
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:28,255
So when it comes to digital standard you know when you start to talk about the things about governance

1209
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,279
Privacy

1210
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,327
Supposed to use a lot of it is

1211
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,375
Not so much about the

1212
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:36,191
The policy it's about making that really clear defense

1213
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,727
Consumers what the policy

1214
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
So

1215
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,311
You're so far the business model

1216
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,335
Pasties

1217
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:46,175
Nowhere it's it's listed as a placeholder in there saying there's going to be something about it

1218
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:49,759
But it's really important that they make clear

1219
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,039
Two customers

1220
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,087
Whether they make their money through advertising

1221
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,879
Subscriptions

1222
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,415
Basically when you buy some

1223
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,999
Something should be transparent about are they making money through

1224
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,791
3 selling your data

1225
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,119
And that ties into something that we constantly

1226
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
Crocodile

1227
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,215
And I hate because I actually read all the TOs has and privacy terms but

1228
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
Do you really

1229
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,543
Yes yes it's really a lot

1230
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,591
But is there anything in here

1231
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,639
Don't want to say I didn't see it

1232
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
But maybe I missed

1233
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,943
Because there is a lot here

1234
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,991
About how we should present

1235
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,527
These kind of terms and

1236
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,575
Cuz there's a lot about terms of service

1237
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
Enforcement of them

1238
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,135
Is there anything about like

1239
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,695
How to make that intelligible without forcing people

1240
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,231
David disagreements which are

1241
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,511
Oh my gosh you guys

1242
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,279
Really

1243
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,303
Really ice cream

1244
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,095
Looking at this

1245
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:36,863
I really am

1246
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,143
Appreciate the focus in terms of

1247
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,959
Privacy policy the things that digital standard

1248
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,495
Asked you for

1249
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:48,895
Are that they are presented in an understandable manner which isn't super clear that's pretty

1250
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:53,247
They should be in language is most commonly spoken by the

1251
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,575
And the company clearly discloses

1252
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,111
Which policy is applied

1253
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,159
The thing you just bought and that

1254
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,975
So they're in

1255
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,511
Huge focus on

1256
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,047
What the terms of service should

1257
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,095
Look like but that it should be clear

1258
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,119
And a field goal

1259
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,167
If someone wants to read them

1260
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,191
It's not

1261
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,263
16 tabs in legalese in

1262
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,799
Cheney is in a place where people are

1263
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,335
Scrolling through on my other

1264
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,943
When your oven oh

1265
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,503
Okay and so

1266
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,295
Along these lines I'm just going to

1267
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,855
Throw out some wishlist I have four connected to

1268
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,415
Devices and see how plausible are where youth

1269
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,951
We might get on some of these

1270
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,487
1 is

1271
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
A lot of these

1272
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,303
The terms of service and privacy

1273
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:41,119
Cease we actually see when we download the app is

1274
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:41,887
For installing

1275
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,679
Vice which feels like

1276
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,471
A really big missed opportunity be

1277
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,751
Because then I'm like

1278
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,799
Crap this device is not secure enough

1279
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,335
It doesn't follow all my

1280
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
You know I don't want to get them

1281
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,175
Can a permission then I have to take it back I might be subbed

1282
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,455
Restocking fee

1283
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,479
Are there

1284
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:59,039
Protections in place or things that we should be advocate

1285
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,111
On my separate personal opinion

1286
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:02,879
One of the greats

1287
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,415
If you have cancer

1288
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,951
Ideas

1289
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,999
It's still under development open source

1290
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,047
Regular people

1291
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,071
Actually makes it

1292
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,375
Birds and components of it but

1293
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
Personally

1294
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:14,911
Yes I do

1295
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
Beverly gradle

1296
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,959
People could read the terms

1297
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,239
Service earlier

1298
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,263
Encouraged

1299
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,543
To I don't know

1300
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,359
Accept terms of service maybe once they put something in their cart

1301
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
Online

1302
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,407
But I think

1303
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,711
You know we still face the problem of someone buying something

1304
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,991
Wanting to

1305
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:32,063
Use the fun new feature isn't going click click click through

1306
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,855
Whatever is between them in the funnies

1307
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,927
Social adjustment

1308
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,999
Every in terms of service as much as I did sign

1309
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,047
Yes but I was thinking about you know

1310
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,583
With the GM story

1311
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:47,423
Text back I was looking at that in like hey you know what if I got my

1312
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,447
My boss my car

1313
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,983
I wanted to turn on Wi-Fi

1314
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,263
Pretty useful

1315
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,287
Features to have in a car

1316
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,567
And then I'm like oh

1317
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:57,919
Wait I'm giving them access to all this crazy data and maybe they did say that they were going to sell

1318
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,991
That's awful

1319
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,807
At the same

1320
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
Sports

1321
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,879
Definitely not

1322
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,183
So those are the kind of things are in like

1323
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,463
But I swear that

1324
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,303
I mean one of the

1325
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,327
Reason set

1326
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,655
I think I consumer-facing standard is really important

1327
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,447
People already read things like

1328
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
Consumer Reports

1329
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,239
When they want

1330
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,519
To buy a car

1331
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,799
And if

1332
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,823
Expectation.

1333
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,847
Terms of service

1334
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,127
Included in the

1335
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:32,479
Consumer Reports

1336
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,503
If you buy this

1337
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,783
Scar it could

1338
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,879
Require you to give over this information it could require you to sign up

1339
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,927
Terms of service questionable

1340
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,231
And so you know what third parties evaluating that

1341
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:47,071
And informing customers about it at the same time as informing them about

1342
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,375
The annoying turn signal flippy thing

1343
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,423
Part of the overall package

1344
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:52,959
Medication

1345
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,495
Great maybe

1346
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,567
Yeah I know I actually thought I'll tell you guys as my audience

1347
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,383
I am looking at this and I'm thinking hey as a reporter

1348
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,663
A lot of these things I do

1349
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,199
Or at least ask about

1350
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
Sometimes

1351
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,783
And that's kind of where we are

1352
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,623
But I would love to see more reporters

1353
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
Asking

1354
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,927
About that sewing

1355
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
Candy

1356
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,767
Reporters are great

1357
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,303
Distorted by carrot and

1358
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,583
Stack and bonus

1359
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,143
But I think the goal is you know anyone who wants to

1360
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,959
I think we're deeply about this any company can do it and he asked

1361
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,727
The organization

1362
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,287
You can do it and I mean it be great if

1363
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,103
On a major data breach of some

1364
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,895
I Was Here by someone says

1365
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,711
Hey you know

1366
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,783
Maybe if they'd adhered to something like the digital standard this wouldn't happen

1367
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,831
Right and so normalizing

1368
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,855
Best practices

1369
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,927
Could be a useful tool in moving the industry as a whole

1370
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,207
Will get there I mean

1371
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,255
