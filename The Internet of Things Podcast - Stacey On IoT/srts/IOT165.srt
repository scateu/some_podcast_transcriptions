You talk to us about

31
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:10,912
How serious is using iot for things like predictive maintenance and then also

32
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,448
What you can expect

33
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
You're connected

34

And more

45
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:55,712
Are you ready I am super hyped because I am in California

46
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,760
It's very early in the morning but

47
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,856
I believe it of the show it's only been going on for half a day and I've already gotten

48
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,904
That's a great information and data

49
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
And

50
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,720
I am really angry angry

51
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
Pyside

52
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
So far

53
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
Big topic is

54
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
Hey

55
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,168
We're kind of not going as fast as we thought because

56
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936
People are

57
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
Flying into this in

58
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,264
Hidden among this is

59
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,360
Value proposition for users expense

60
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
The big thing is

61
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
Probability

62
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
Nothing

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,992
It's hard for them to figure out

64
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Works with what

65
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
They're talking

66
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
About this at the show

67
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
It's this mystery force

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,976
Like not every single one of them has had

69
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,536
A goal of creating their own platform

70
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
You're ready to give that up

71
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
Actually work for Sammy's

72
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Spell standards

73
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,960
That's the thing aren't these the people that are creating this industry

74
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,824
And they have created this mess themselves by trying to do it all internally

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,104
In their own brands

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Yes

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
Yes that is true

78
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
So

79
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:03,296
I will not harp on this too much because we all know it's frustrating that are devices don't

80
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,648
Work together in

81
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
But

82
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,488
The first panel of the event officially

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
What is a bunch of guys who

84
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,840
Came up from Cox from ATT

85
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,888
There's someone from Vivint the result

86
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
August and someone from the beta store

87
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,728
Basically talked about

88
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
Interoperability

89
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
Yeah like it's hard

90
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
And it is hot

91
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
But it doesn't

92
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
I have to be hard

93
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
You know this is something obviously we've been harping on for a long long time and I don't see it getting any better soon

94
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,784
Partially because

95
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
This industry has

96
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
Gained momentum

97
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,184
Without the interoperability and yes interoperability would certainly

98
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,584
Pellet further faster but that may mean that people might have to replace devices hubs switches

99
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
So here's my

100
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,680
Does Hawaii have

101
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,008
In this is something I don't know if it's actually going to happen but

102
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,824
I've actually talked to two companies recently that are

103
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,920
In trying to implement OCS standards

104
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,016
These are data schema score

105
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,832
Different devices so basically think of a data scheme

106
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
You can

107
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
Automatically generate that

108
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
From their stuff and this is the open connectivity

109
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
Foundation this is

110
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
You should be Intel's group and then

111
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,375
Maybe that's going to happen

112
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,447
I thought that was going to happen in 2016 but they didn't come out with

113
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
Good reference back but now that's

114
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
Stout

115
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,359
I don't know that's really kind of my only hope invoice is not my only

116
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
I'm sorry people who feel like

117
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Chernobyl

118
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
Yeah they do it all the time

119
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:44,927
Your voice voices of user interface it's not the back and that's the thing and people kind of confused

120
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Potoo

121
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
I mean voice is just a way to interact with your devices but it doesn't help necessarily the devices interact together need back answer

122
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,167
Nervous system made that happen standards Etc so

123
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,495
I'm glad people are realizing my voice is not the answer

124
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:05,151
Interesting label two points coming out a little bit and the challenges of it

125
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
Voicemail

126
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,319
Listen to voicemail this week later in the show so they just highlights the challenge right there and also

127
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
This is almost like

128
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,207
We can talk about using matches well but this almost reminds me of the whole ezmatch thing we talked about last week

129
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:23,839
So what is the incentive for these companies to work with other products it makes more sense

130
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,191
With a device as opposed to the router guys because the router people have their own

131
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,007
Things that work their routers work today

132
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Interbrand

133
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
They don't want or need

134
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,151
To work with other brands even though consumers would benefit from that

135
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,199
The device side again

136
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,551
So much of this is already rolled out so this should have been done already

137
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,207
Now I will say and I'm going to write something up about this

138
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Spell so happy

139
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
Mark Spitz who

140
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
In charge of Google

141
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,631
Did Speaker business and that means Google home in the Google Max speaker

142
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,191
He was talking about AI

143
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,263
Products in what was really kind of

144
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Compelling and interesting is he

145
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
What about the levels of

146
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,431
Since you needed to deliver certain AI experiences and can we talk about this

147
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
Be more intuitive

148
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
So he was saying

149
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
If you want a curated experience

150
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,855
You have like a 70%

151
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Confidence interval

152
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,975
Hey this person seems to like this type of music

153
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Let me just play

154
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,791
It's highly likely that that's going to

155
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Right

156
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
Do you want a corrective mod

157
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
So something where they

158
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,447
Think of a motion sensor

159
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
Sitting to Silver

160
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
It's okay when that have

161
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,407
Just a little irritating you got to wave your arms around but it's not the consequences

162
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
Not too huge

163
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,223
For that you need to be 85

164
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
That you're going to get

165
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,623
And then predicted which is where we kind of want to go is you have to have a

166
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,975
Confidence level of like five 9 to be able to deliver this experience

167
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,815
Because otherwise you're going to get clippy their real-world consequences for

168
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Like money make change hands

169
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Smart assistant

170
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Hey I think

171
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,007
These signals all result in Stacy going to

172
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
The airport

173
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
What she always does

174
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Let me just send that

175
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
How to do those kind of things

176
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
Probably need to be

177
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
User

178
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
Supposed to add

179
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Quite some time

180
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,135
I thought that was really interesting it's good food for thought for you guys as you starting to build you know

181
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
AI products in

182
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
I'd be curious to hear what y'all

183
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
And that is all

184
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
All I've done so far

185
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Fox Home Center

186
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,167
I'm sure I'll talk about it next weekend I'm sure you'll see more in this week's newsletter

187
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
So now onto

188
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,007
Anime which is what we call

189
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,103
Amazon's personal assistant Just So to avoid setting off all of your devices

190
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
So she's got some new

191
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:52,319
Cheetahs and this is a talent that Google Assistant doesn't have is beyond me and you'll understand

192
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
Second Sole

193
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:58,975
What happened this week is Amazon announced their Madam a smart scheduling assistant

194
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:05,631
And what you can do now is ask Madame a to schedule a meeting with one of your contacts and she will actually check

195
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,655
Check and see

196
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,239
When you to have time available which is awesome

197
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:15,615
So I could say Madam a schedule a meeting with Stacy and matinee would say you would say Siri available from

198
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
3 p.m. today

199
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
5 to 7 p.m. on Friday what day and time should I schedule social actually check and then ask you

200
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
You didn't respond the time

201
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:30,463
You can give her the name of the event and she will schedule it and she'll send an invite

202
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
Email invoice to

203
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
The other party

204
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,655
If you already know the time you can just schedule the meeting with that person at a set time

205
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
And she will still check

206
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
To see if there's availability and

207
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,543
Will say if there's a

208
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
Conflict or something

209
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
So that's kind of nice

210
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,455
This is already out there for Amazon's madhumeh for business accounts

211
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,783
But it also is available for consumers as well

212
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
And it works with links

213
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,903
Calendars from a mixture have it right Gmail

214
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
G Suite

215
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,071
Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Office exchange 2013 or better so

216
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:12,703
Again this is one of those things that I'm like this with my Google Calendar but it doesn't work with my Google home

217
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,775
Either way I think it's an awesome use of voice

218
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
Assistance

219
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,103
Both parties have to have their calendars huh

220
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
Hooked up to

221
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:27,039
That is correct you actually have to add either your work or your personal contacts to the matinee app

222
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,599
And some of mine are already in there like you are

223
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Because

224
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Talked

225
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
The drop in

226
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
So

227
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
This is awesome

228
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
This is Mike this could

229
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
So much relief

230
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
Cuz half of my life is scheduling

231
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
Meetings I swear

232
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,287
So now everybody who wants to be with me

233
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
Man put your calendar on

234
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
Yeah please

235
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,991
You know what's really nice because managing these events also can be a time-consuming thing

236
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:02,367
You can actually say Madam a move my 9 a.m. meeting and change the time

237
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
It's like magic

238
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
Okay this is where we're going

239
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
So exciting

240
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
Okay

241
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
Is

242
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,911
Amazon the ACLU

243
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,495
Put out some data that Amazon is selling facial recognition.

244
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,031
Technology to police depart

245
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Which

246
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,615
Is upsetting because

247
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
Give me clear signal to the world

248
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,271
Hey we have all this camera dude is picking up our faces we have the ability to recognize

249
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
In

250
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
Now we can sell it to a lot of horse

251
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
I feel like the story

252
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
It's not overblown

253
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,743
Exactly it's a great example of everything that Kevin and I

254
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,047
Talk about in the abstract so I think it's important

255
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Forgot birthday

256
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,911
But it's also important to know that what Amazon is selling is

257
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,959
The recognition and that's a recognition

258
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
Computer vision

259
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
Facial recognition

260
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
So

261
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
This is not taking

262
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,431
Verdi. This is applying their recognition to

263
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
Cool to

264
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Cops

265
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Data

266
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,063
I say this because a lot of us are freaking out

267
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
Because Amazon sells

268
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
Because of the blank acquisition

269
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Cameras

270
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
And they have her

271
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,999
They still sell this but the Amazon Echo look

272
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,559
Which takes images of yuan

273
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
Cool outfits

274
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
Person tells you how to be more stylish

275
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
So

276
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,679
Big data Amazon

277
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
Reply it's facial Ricky

278
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
You should stop to that

279
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
For all I know it does

280
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Question to ask

281
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
But they're not selling your

282
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
Which I think is in a

283
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:38,367
It's a huge distinction as a consumer I'm not overly concerned that my cameras are using facial recognition

284
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:44,255
Mission sending out that data to third parties this is dated at the law enforcement agencies I think

285
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,655
Particularly sperm ACLU standpoint Washington County Sheriff's Office in Oregon is using it that mean

286
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,959
Had a database of mugshots and other

287
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:57,823
Things to cross-reference faces so they were using facial recognition on the day that they have

288
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,639
Not scanning webcams for

289
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
People which is very different you're right

290
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Aunt

291
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Now

292
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Just two

293
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,551
Put this into like hey the future is coming

294
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
Apply this with ring

295
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
The ring doorbell

296
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
The neighbors app

297
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
So Amazon now

298
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
They've got the neighbors out

299
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,279
This is actually your ring doorbell data

300
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Going

301
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
2

302
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
The police if there is an open

303
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Case File

304
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
So the police

305
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
File to get some data from

306
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,335
They have a case they can actually get dataforma neighborhoods ring doorbells

307
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
And from there they have

308
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
Facial data

309
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
From your smart home stuff

310
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,991
Which then the police if they

311
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
We had recognition any number of services that are similar

312
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
Other vendors

313
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
They could actually

314
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,207
Find a perpetrator or maybe find someone who's innocent

315
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
Just is in the wrong place

316
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
So that is something to say

317
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,935
Stop being a little paranoid and then we have to think about the ramifications of putting

318
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Cameras everywhere

319
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,543
When we also have access to really good facial

320
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
Recognition

321
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
And I don't think we've actually talked about that

322
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,943
Societal level noretta regulatory

323
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
Maybe we should

324
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
I think we should

325
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
All right

326
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
Let's talk about

327
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
Easy mesh

328
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
The cracks are already showing

329
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:23,071
PS so we talked about using match last week and just to recap this is the Wi-Fi Alliance standard

330
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
That

331
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,911
Will allow interoperability there's that word again

332
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Of mesh

333
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,263
Networking routers and access points from different

334
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,663
Bender so instead of today you can buy all Orbeez are all those are all Google I-5 whatever maybe

335
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
In the future you may be able to mix and match

336
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
And I had said

337
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:47,391
I don't see any incentive for these router makers to really adopt this and packets disincentive

338
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
But that was my thoughts

339
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,255
Sure nuff Fast Company reached out to several router makers

340
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,815
At some of these are Wi-Fi on its members

341
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,655
They say they are not rushing on interoperability

342
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:05,055
And in fact an executive at Qualcomm which makes the chips inside these router as an access point Express skepticism

343
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
Non-coding now

344
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,383
But the current standard will bring down prices or aloud

345
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,503
Competing systems to work together so even the folks who helped devise the standard

346
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,807
I'm in the alliance are like

347
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
I don't really think so

348
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
I just got to

349
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Too fast

350
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,207
Yes I need the Wi-Fi Alliance was behind the ball on this

351
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,023
Finishing the hat and now they have

352
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
No reason

353
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
The standard

354
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
So maybe

355
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
All right

356
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,191
Titus Comcast

357
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,031
It's part of their xfinitywifi

358
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
These are not the actual pods manufactured by

359
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
There going to be a 6 pack of these

360
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,295
Hi switch basically you plug in

361
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
Apartment

362
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,927
Where you have poor connectivity

363
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
Six-pack Acosta

364
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,583
199 which is cheaper than the plural version

365
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
Comcast is ginormous

366
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
And

367
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,239
I try these out I thought they were good they did suffer

368
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Prince of the sea

369
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Speed test

370
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Traditional

371
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
Magazine

372
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
And that's because

373
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
Their focus is on

374
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Average

375
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Fixing

376
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
Issues

377
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503
I think we're going to be moving for me

378
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
Hefei

379
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,599
Lasted in a small radius kind of

380
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
Check the speed

381
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
World 2

382
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Hey

383
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,975
Can I get decent coverage everywhere.

384
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,303
My house doesn't have to be the fastest because how many people are really

385
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,119
How many devices are really going to use a Kegerator 300

386
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
4 seconds

387
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
Really probably just

388
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,543
And you should really hardwired

389
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,335
Okay

390
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
So that's the

391
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,895
Cast news

392
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,175
All part of Comcast

393
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
Wi-Fi is super in

394
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Our plans

395
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
As a broadband

396
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,599
And without good WiFi you can't do anything

397
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,391
They can't sell their Smart Homes

398
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
Services

399
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
Chandelure good Internet Explorer

400
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:05,119
These are really smart because they don't have to send a tech out they just send out this tiny little device that you plug into an outlet

401
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,679
Your wife I magically gets better

402
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
Stop assuming that you were using your car

403
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
Comcast Supply

404
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Modem

405
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Router

406
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
$11

407
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Craziness

408
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
So

409
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
This is giving you value for that

410
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
Can you be

411
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
Nope sorry you can't tell me I'm using their router

412
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
That's okay

413
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
I'm not trying

414
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
That's all that

415
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,191
Yeah little bit of iot maker news now in the Maker Faire Bay Area event

416
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,775
The Arduino folks announce to new iot boards

417
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
Stacy you're a chip girl you're going to love the first

418
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,919
Is the mkr Vidor 4000

419
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:56,319
And it just the first Arduino board based on an fpga chip or field programmable gate array chip

420
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
You're excited aren't you

421
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
That

422
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
Is amazing

423
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
And we want to say why it's so amazing

424
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,791
I really love to hear you I would love to hear you say why

425
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
Oh my gosh this is time it is something that I actually want to write about

426
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
Which is

427
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,959
We're entering the Sarah ship customization

428
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,263
And it could be through fpga

429
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Architecture

430
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,639
But what's happening is Ashley at

431
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
Computing to everything

432
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,711
We no longer have these

433
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,247
Call Nautilus

434
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
Smart Home

435
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
PC

436
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
Server

437
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
It will still happen

438
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
So we have this additional

439
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Market

440
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
Or chips that

441
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,767
Optimized to do something very specific

442
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,095
So maybe it is to be very good

443
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
Empowering

444
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
Water sensor

445
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Or

446
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
To be powering

447
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,727
Camera

448
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Recognition

449
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
Retail store

450
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
So you're going to get a lot of these more

451
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Customize

452
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,151
Scale-out

453
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
The production of

454
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
Alien ships that you

455
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
We need to do it

456
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
Traditional chip pan

457
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Manufacturing

458
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
Process

459
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
Programmable

460
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
Or adaptive

461
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
Economic

462
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
So that's what the fpgas are

463
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
That's right

464
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,839
Yeah he's awesome a lot of what you describe is

465
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,679
What I would call like an Asic or an application-specific integrated circuit

466
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Annette

467
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
Just like a Bitcoin miner uses an Asic it's at that chipped as one thing and one thing only in it mines Bitcoin

468
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,431
You should say yes these are changeable on the fly in the

469
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
Reason for that

470
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
I was like

471
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
I didn't talk about an AI

472
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:36,671
The reason for that is because the jobs are going to be doing the AI job search

473
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023
Spot on

474
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
So I thought you would like this board

475
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
This looks

476
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:50,495
A lot like a Raspberry Pi board like if you're familiar with the large Arduino boards and it's got Wi-Fi built in and different ports and so

477
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:54,335
Salon I don't have a price on that I think it's going to be available next month

478
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,871
So we'll see what happens

479
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,175
And then if you need a really small

480
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:04,575
New Arduino board Wi-Fi revision to which I mean it looks like she's half a board almost looks like

481
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,647
Memory module inside a computer for crying out has a really small

482
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:13,023
And that has like just a miniscule amount like 6K of ram 48k of Flash

483
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
And that's what microchip

484
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,887
Yeah this is really freezing

485
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
Cloud-based

486
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:24,031
Iot devices that they say it will work with AWS and Google Cloud for example so

487
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,847
That also comes out next month so we'll see on pricing

488
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,639
Okay I'm going to let you guys know that I'm

489
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,663
Hotel

490
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,967
And it's starting to get a little noisy

491
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,783
703 distance

492
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
Ignore the background

493
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
Yay do Arduino

494
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
A company called eco

495
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,023
Million dollars

496
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,423
And Nico is a really interesting company to me because they make a light switch but they've optimize their sales

497
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
The builders

498
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,519
So what happens is it's for new construction

499
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,103
You go in and you say hey this is exactly how many light switches

500
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,687
And you say what rooms are and everything like that is

501
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Builder

502
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,735
You send it to decal

503
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
And they said

504
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,039
Send you a package that is like

505
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
No brainer install

506
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
Disguise

507
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
He put it in the right room

508
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
It's got the right

509
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
Intelligence associated with

510
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
Nothing has to be

511
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Programmed

512
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
Without

513
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
Any work

514
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
I do all the work on the

515
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:29,055
So there's no configuration by the consumer which is nice to one aspect because they don't have to mess around with it

516
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,383
So it's going to come with different scenes and so on pre-configured

517
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,943
Does that mean you can't change them in the future

518
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
Okay that's good

519
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,039
Guy ideas to make

520
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Make it as easy as pie

521
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,831
Gotcha

522
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,623
So it's kind of like the new lights

523
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
Except those are a retrofit option

524
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,743
Channel established

525
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
So with the new lights

526
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,583
You can buy them you install them

527
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,655
They have these programs being so you should never have to do it

528
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,519
Right if I recall correctly the decode lighting system

529
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:05,151
Is capable matamata on Google home already

530
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
And Google assist

531
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
You can add those

532
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
Don't worry

533
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
All right

534
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319
Let's go to next

535
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,391
Next little bit of news ala who is in iot

536
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,256
So companies like Hunter Fans I feel like there's some Appliance manufacturers in there

537
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,816
When they want to build a Knex product

538
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Famous cloud

539
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:28,192
Play pop it in and all their data goes to Eli Eli manages the device data

540
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,728
It managed everything for them

541
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:36,128
So they now have a dad

542
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
Google

543
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
So

544
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:43,552
Yeah and this is actually worth noting because Google doesn't have a great device management

545
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,696
They've got lovely insides and pitiful but they don't actually

546
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,976
Deal with

547
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,768
Telemetry data as it is

548
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,816
So this is actually Win 4

549
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
Both

550
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,680
Because they said their customers

551
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
We want to know.

552
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,752
Stinger stuck on AWS

553
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
They don't have to

554
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,616
And speaking of Google Cloud

555
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,456
Evan is going to tell you about our latest iot project

556
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,248
Which is moving our voicemail platform

557
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,344
Yeah so we

558
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,744
Guilty party voicemail hotline using Python and twilio last year and we talked about

559
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,584
Put it on the cloud back then but me being a very very

560
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,632
Amateur developer

561
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,192
Work for so we put on a Raspberry Pi

562
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
And that's worth

563
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:38,592
Mostly pretty well any issues after having been with a pie with a code it's been with

564
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:43,968
My dog pulling the power cord on the local Internet outages things like that

565
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,016
Outside of Genoa my control

566
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:52,672
So I started digging around and looking at different Cloud Solutions we could have gone AWS Google Cloud Azure whatever

567
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,000
But I already have a free account with

568
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,560
Google Cloud platform along with

569
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:04,448
$300 in credit and all that was good for a year and I highly recommend if you want to play with

570
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,984
Using the cloud

571
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:11,360
This is a great way to do it you can sign up for the free trial account and not paying anything

572
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
A year which is awesome

573
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,224
My years almost up but we still not going to pay anything because

574
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
AR

575
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:23,648
Voice mail server just barely uses any CPU cycles and not too much Network bandwidth it's only when you guys call in so

576
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,696
I mean calling you know anytime

577
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:32,096
We certainly got the van with the handle it decided to Google cloud and a post

578
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,888
Marty Explains It All

579
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:40,288
Basically I didn't have to change my single line of the Python code I just had to get it up on Google Cloud using there

580
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:45,664
Cloud console which is very easy to do and just add two other little files for configuration purposes

581
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,712
I also had to create a virtual machine

582
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:54,112
And you can choose the all really small virtual machine which is obvious that we did I mean it's literally 600 Meg of memory and

583
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,160
Just like one CPU core

584
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:01,024
But mean if you're on Netflix or somebody you obviously have hundreds and hundreds of cores

585
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:07,168
Tons of bandwidth that you needn't sound so the cloud makes a scalable that applies obviously to Google Cloud azure

586
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,752
AWS etcetera we probably won't ever have to scale this but it's good to know

587
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,080
In any case once I got all the files up there

588
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
Literally I just spun up the

589
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
Virtual machine and toilet to deploy

590
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
My app

591
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:25,600
And that was it and all I had to do after that because we use twilio and twilio needs to know when you guys call in on the

592
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,624
Trulia phone number

593
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,024
Where do I find code to do something with this information

594
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,816
URL

595
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:39,424
Configure Trulia wetsand naturally appoints to not the pie anymore but to Google Cloud

596
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,288
And that's it that whole thing was seamless you guys didn't even notice any transition because it just

597
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Happened

598
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,104
And so far it's been working great

599
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
Yay

600
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,712
Thanks Kevin and he said we in there but it's really

601
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,552
I like to Tinker

602
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
I love it

603
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
Would you like to Tinker

604
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
So

605
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
Speaking

606
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,928
Voicemail

607
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:05,024
If you would like to give us a call and have us answer your questions

608
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,328
60

609
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
7 4

610
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,960
This week's iot podcast listener hotline

611
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,896
Which leg you can have a brand new electronic lock installed in Venice just a screwdriver

612
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
And

613
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,200
They're easy to setup and use

614
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,504
To see what's possible visit schlage.com

615
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
To learn more

616
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,344
And this week we have a voicemail from

617
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
White

618
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,416
Perfectly illustrates

619
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,976
All points that we have discussed so far

620
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,328
Hey Stacy and Kevin this is Dwight from Atlanta

621
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,632
Actually calling with a question

622
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:46,752
I want to know if there is a way that if there's a device that I

623
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
Use

624
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:53,920
Physically cut on my light bulbs I have a mixture of Hue Lights and

625
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,736
And I know that Hugh makes a product

626
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,272
That can allow you

627
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,808
Toggle light switch off

628
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,392
But I was wondering if there was a device that works

629
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,720
Both lights anyways you can make that

630
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:11,584
If you know of a device that might be useful I would appreciate that thank you

631
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,656
This is a wonderful question

632
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
The state of the

633
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
You should

634
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,312
It's hard to answer your question exactly because we don't

635
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Actually know what you

636
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
So we're going to run through a

637
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
Apple scenarios

638
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,224
The basic architecture is you're going to have

639
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:32,320
To run each of your lighting things through some kind of software

640
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
Hug

641
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
And then run a button

642
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
True that

643
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,976
So there's a couple ways you can do this first way

644
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,280
Is probably in the best ways probably

645
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,096
Kevin can tell you a little bit about that

646
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
Right so

647
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:52,032
If you have homekit the lifx all the lifx bulbs actually support homekit so you're good there and Phillips

648
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
She was only have the second generation Bridge you're good there what you could do that and maybe is look at one of the homekit button such as the new

649
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,480
Button from fibaro and you'll be all set

650
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:06,368
My lifx bulb is the only thing I have on homekit so I can type tested this but this should work

651
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,648
Again if you have Home Care

652
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,952
What if he doesn't have Home Care Stacy

653
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,304
So if your home can implementation doesn't work what you're going to have to do

654
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Use smart

655
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,400
Don't have SmartThings

656
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
Proposition

657
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,472
Because you're going to have to buy the Hub

658
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,288
And her to probably going to have to buy something to act as your butt

659
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
And there are wide

660
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,848
Range

661
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,944
$30 buttons

662
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
Button to

663
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,016
Take these tiny little Z-Wave

664
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,088
So you'll hook up your lifx bulbs

665
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,136
3 SmartThings you hook up your

666
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
Free SmartThings

667
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Create

668
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
Recipe receipt

669
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
Little button press contact

670
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
And that

671
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
Is how you're going to be able to do that

672
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,448
Tennessee

673
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,104
The only thing I can think of on the wink Hub site even though it's not natively supported

674
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,640
The lifx bulbs I mean

675
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:07,040
Maybe using a third-party system like if this then that or you know me could work with wink at it should work with

676
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,344
As long as you have a button that would work with wink

677
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:18,304
Center operability issues

678
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,584
But that's how it work

679
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,960
Thank you to answer your question and everybody remember you can call five one two

680
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
6 to 3

681
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
744

682
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
2

683
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,080
Have us answer your own

684
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
Smart home question

685
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,432
And stay tuned

686
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
Midget bowling

687
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,760
CEO of Sears Home Services

688
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:44,160
In a message from our sponsor we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast

689
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,488
Our sponsor

690
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
Comcast service

691
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
And I have Alex Crum

692
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,096
To talk about how machine

693
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
Is evolving

694
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
So Alex

695
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
Remind us

696
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
What

697
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
Fishing Q is Comcast

698
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,312
B2B and b2c it business

699
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,616
Focus on providing network connectivity

700
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,896
For switching partners

701
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:09,504
We're also growing Andrew bus portfolio of points Pacific IT solutions

702
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,576
Awesome so last week we talked about how customers will

703
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,160
Use machineq to start measuring some aspect of their operations

704
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
But then they quickly

705
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,720
People try to add more

706
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
Can you offer an exam

707
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,048
For singing The Marketplace

708
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:26,656
Many of our initial solution providers are able to go in there and solve

709
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,448
Particular need at Syracuse

710
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
I'm going to come back to us

711
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264
And ask hey by the way

712
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,824
This additional services that these people looking

713
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,712
For so perfect example would be looking to go to a restaurant and provide temperature humidity for their Cold Case

714
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:43,040
One of our solution providers have provided in the full stack solution

715
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:47,648
That's what they sell for that they might want to do predictive maintenance all the refrigerators as well

716
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:53,280
They come back machineq and say is another solution provider in your ecosystem they can sell for predictive maintenance

717
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,072
Portland only see you there

718
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,936
Terms of private Enterprises but an example of beat for what we did a Comcast cares day

719
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,984
We went to a local Garden Philadelphia

720
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,800
And they asked us for swelling monitor sensors

721
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,848
Freezing a partner bars called sensoterra

722
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:13,248
After they realize that we had network coverage in that area and they were able to monitor their soil monitor with that device to ask this with anything else

723
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:17,856
Air quality that might be used there which of course we happen to have decent labs

724
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:21,696
Another one of our solution providers and they installed a decent labs are monitored

725
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,768
They said for the indoor Greenhouse

726
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,096
Use cases we're also trying to measure temperature humidity as well

727
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,912
There something that can be used there we said yes we actually have

728
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,192
Our own device called the answer

729
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,728
Q Flex that can do that for you

730
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:40,128
In the market is while many users have a particular need for one iot solution that quickly come back once

731
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:46,528
Recognize what that's done for them and they're seeking additional services at scale quickly but having to go and do an RFP

732
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,832
Where to go down as particular Pilots

733
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,184
We talked about this picture customers interested in working with machineq worry

734
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,952
If they aren't in a

735
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Comcast service area

736
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,816

758
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,256
So let's kick this off with

759
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,536
I just ate brought over

Cancel good questions

763
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Sears Home Services is

764
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:11,520
Appliance repair we've had that business for decades we also have a home improvement business

765
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,592
Wally home or Wally Labs as part of Sears Home Services

766
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,896
And we have a new exciting service

767
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
Call service line

768
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,248
So that's what we do we serve customers around the country

769
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,088
No matter what brand of Appliance they bought where they bought it we serviced it

770
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
I imagine so

771
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,232
This is a business that's tailor-made for The Internet of Things

772
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,024
I can think of my gosh predictive maintenance

773
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,048
Cats understanding

774
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,120
From a connected Appliance what's wrong see if the right parts on the truck

775
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,680
There's probably a million other things but can you talk about what

776
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,496
What you guys are doing here today

777
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
Will go into what you

778
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
Are thinking about doing

779
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:48,384
Yeah I mean you hit on some of the things that are happening today

780
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,944
Are Kenmore appliances that we sell our

781
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,736
Working web connected their smart Appliance

782
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,040
A lot of the appliances we work on for

783
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:59,648
Some other brands are also smart appliances so we're faced with those are we

784
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
See those everyday

785
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,744
We're able to use those Diagnostics to

786
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,280
Help solve the problem faster

787
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
For consumer

788
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,328
We also

789
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,144
Use technology to help our technicians

790
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,192
Turn the home solve problems faster

791
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:18,592
We do that by connecting that technician to an application to our effectively a tear to where they

792
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,128
They can call if they have a really tough

793
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
Situation in the field

794
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,968
Where they can send them live video then

795
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,248
Shenzhen pictures

796
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,320
We can send them back schematics to a product so

797
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,344
We're seeing

798
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
Connected devices

799
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,952
We're working with those were also using technology to be

800
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
Faster smarter

801
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,512
And help our customers

802
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,280
Okay

803
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:43,680
It's actually something I talked about was Sears at CES you guys were actually bringing this concept of using video to help repair

804
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:47,520
Turn appliance that your texts are using today in to hopefully

805
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,824
The consumer home so like someone like me

806
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,896
Steals fairly confident and mucking about with the stuff my

807
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
Also have to chance

808
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,248
Yeah we're working on that we have a lot of customer

809
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,832
Merced do DIY which is great we serve those as well

810
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,368
And as you said

811
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
We use the technology

812
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
Today 4 Hour

813
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
Technicians it's it's sort of our

814
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,232
Proving Grounds For That

815
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,280
Technology but we absolutely right

816
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
In the process

817
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,584
The ruling that out

818
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,864
We've tested that

819
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
We're making some change

820
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,168
Just to wear that what we want to be able

821
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:15,936
Things to do is

822
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,728
Give that DIY customer

823
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:21,312
Are the ability to call us if they just need a little bit of help troubleshooting

824
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
Where they can

825
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,872
Using their phone which

826
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,664
Practically everyone has a smartphone

827
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,712
And show us

828
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,760
Exactly what they are seeing

829
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,528
And we can help them

830
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
I think that is so cool

831
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,344
I cannot wait for this to become

832
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,136
Actually do you think this would become

833
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,928
Standard in

834
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
The service world

835
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,024
I think it's possible that it can work very

836
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,304
Excited about it the cusp

837
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
Feedback

838
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,888
Been very positive you know in this day and age is everything

839
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,960
Comes more and more automated smart device

840
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
Applicable

841
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
I think

842
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
If it's

843
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,800
I think it's almost

844
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,104
Impossible for it not to be very common

845
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
Play sand

846
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
Future

847
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,432
In other areas where I am

848
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,784
Well you mentioned predictive

849
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Maintenance

850
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,088
That's something that

851
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,368
You know the industry

852
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
Sears included

853
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Is working

854
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Whether it's

855
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,768
My group from a service perspective or are Kenmore

856
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:18,400
Team from a building those products and other competitors as well but that is the future I think of

857
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,704
Appliances for sure and more things in the

858
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,544
Many things in the home as you know are becoming smarter every day

859
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,848
We want to be able to get to a point

860
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Where

861
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,944
I'll just use an example your refrigerator can tell us

862
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,968
In a proactive

863
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:35,040
Give way whether it needs a water filter change

864
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
Origin

865
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:42,720
Maybe it has a part that's going bad or is using more energy than it should that's an indication is that something is

866
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:47,840
Wrong with that client so that's what you know the industry's working toward their real working examples of that

867
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:51,936
Today where that information goes to a consumer app on their smartphone

868
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,008
But what we're working toward is where we can

869
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
Look at that from

870
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
Service perspective

871
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
Proactively

872
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,104
Contact the cost

873
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,896
And solve a problem before it

874
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,224
That means that their inconvenience level drops

875
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
Refrigerator

876
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
Cuz

877
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
You know you have now you have

878
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,112
Food that can spoil and

879
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
That's not good for anyone

880
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,952
This is such a cool and compelling vision

881
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,768
As someone who's you know how to dryer breakdown

882
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,840
Right as I'm transferring my white clothes to it for example

883
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,400
Yes I lost refrigerator

884
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:26,752
How do you convince customers that you're doing this for their own good

885
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,544
And build trust because

886
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,592
There's also this sense of like

887
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,920
This is about to break down are you sure you just don't want to sell me another part

888
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,016
I think consumers today actually

889
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,600
Past that and understand that predictive maintenance

890
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,136
Part of life

891
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,696
As I mentioned before there are other

892
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:49,792
Devices in our lives today that are trying to be predicted

893
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,072
Some cars are trying

894
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
To be predicted

895
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,912
I mean if you think about it the check engine light from

896
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,960
50 years ago

897
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,240
Is an indicator that

898
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,056
Nothing is wrong with taking the check engine light to

899
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,616
A whole new level in this digital age

900
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:07,712
So I think consumers understand that it actually gives them an opportunity

901
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,248
Key to save money

902
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,040
From early detection

903
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
Versus

904
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,368
In a waiting and waiting when they may not know something

905
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,184
Problem creates additional costs

906
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,512
I think it's a positive for consumers I think it allows

907
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:26,912
Them to do things on their schedule versus the schedule of their Appliance if it breaks which it needs to be repaired

908
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,680
Now

909
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,984
Preventive maintenance they're going to have a window that they can

910
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,776
That's okay I think it's

911
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,544
Going to be

912
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,568
Very positive

913
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,360
Consumers when this becomes

914
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,640
Commonplace again

915
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,920
We and others have

916
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
These devices

917
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,736
Appliances in the marketplace now

918
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,040
It's making them the norm

919
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,832
And you know it'll take awhile but

920
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,368
Is there a lot of Legacy applying

921
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
Out there in Appliance last

922
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,952
But the changes everyday and

923
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
Percentage of

924
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
Smart appliances goes up

925
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,536
Literally every day

926
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
So it's

927
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
The future is exciting

928
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,168
You mentioned that you guys are working on this

929
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,216
What needs to happen for this to

930
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
Become

931
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,776
I guess common place or

932
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
Real

933
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
Well

934
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,104
Smart appliances are real today

935
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,128
They are

936
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,176
In consumer homes today

937
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
Connected to

938
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
The web

939
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,552
Connect to the cloud by a better way to say it

940
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
And customers are getting info

941
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,624
Information on there

942
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,184
Where I think there's a real opportunity is

943
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,744
Moving that to a proactive state

944
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,304
With a Service Company like ours

945
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,096
Where we can proactive

946
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
Contact

947
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,168
Customer maybe they missed the alert on the

948
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
Their phone

949
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,496
You know maybe they didn't Lodi Athena's there could be reason

950
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,288
They don't see that where we could help

951
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,568
Buy proactive

952
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,384
If we contacted them and I think what gets us there

953
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,920
It's time

954
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,736
Because we need more Ubiquiti

955
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,528
When I say we the industry

956
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,832
Needs more ubiquity of smart

957
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
Appliances

958
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
And that's happening

959
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,160
Just the way you know

960
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,232
Color TVs eventually overtook black and white teeth

961
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,768
It takes time for those

962
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,816
Things to be replaced

963
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,352
But that's part of

964
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,632
The evolution of

965
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,400
Smart Appliance

966
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,960
All right and let's go to one of my

967
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:08,032
What are the topics I've been most eager to hear about which is

968
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,592
Wally home Sears bought this a while back

969
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
And

970
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,664
It kind of went under the radar so

971
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
What are you guys doing with Wally

972
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,248
So yeah well he's a very exciting

973
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,296
Product anyone I came onboard

974
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,832
Sears giving my

975
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,368
Comcast background check

976
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
You know you're very smelly wet

977
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,488
We move that business into Sears Home Services

978
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
I've spent

979
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,584
Years of my life in the iot space

980
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,144
But it's a very exciting product

981
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,192
See all the product itself I believe

982
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
What's the best in the industry

983
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,008
Between the water sensors

984
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
Are hogs

985
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,824
The water valve itself

986
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,616
You know I have all of this in my house and

987
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
I feel protected

988
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,200
From a water leak

989
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,504
Water damage is one of the highest

990
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,784
Repair door

991
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
I guess damage claims

992
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
Industry

993
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:01,280
Because usually when those things happen it's hours before you know if you're at work

994
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:05,376
It's pumping water all day so we protect Palms from that

995
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,168
Again I feel very protective

996
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,704
Could I have that product soap

997
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,240
What we need to do is continue

998
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
Expand that so

999
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,800
We are working with

1000
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,824
Several

1001
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,848
Insurance companies

1002
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,640
The same way we work

1003
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,944
You know I work with insurance companies when I was

1004
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
Comcast

1005
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
4

1006
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,016
Security in home automation

1007
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:22,784
Devices

1008
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,088
Where we were able to

1009
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,624
Help consumer save money

1010
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
We haven't

1011
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,512
Are solved anything at this point but we're in great conversation

1012
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,048
We're also

1013
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,608
You know in that idea of water damage

1014
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,888
If you think about it

1015
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,656
As a

1016
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,448
Individual homeowner

1017
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
It's bad

1018
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,544
But sink imagine you are in a high-rise where is

1019
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,336
Apartment on the top floor has a

1020
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,384
Malik well everybody Bulova

1021
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
Then probably has a

1022
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,200
2 because of water flows downhill

1023
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,248
We talked to a lot of property owner

1024
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,552
And or property managers that

1025
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,832
If that's one of their biggest

1026
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,856
Concerned soap

1027
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
We're in

1028
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,648
Several trials

1029
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:06,048
Those with multi-tenant high-rise buildings today they're seeing the value of the products so we're excited about a real future there too

1030
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
Not only provide

1031
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,608
Vistana

1032
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,888
Consumer basis but also on

1033
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
B2B basis

1034
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
And in addition

1035
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,472
We have recently

1036
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,776
Started using our Sears home service

1037
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,312
Appliance technician

1038
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,848
There now

1039
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,640
Selling the product in a trial base

1040
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:26,016
Selling the Wally product when they go into homes especially to go into a second home for a consumer

1041
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,576
It's a perfect product for a second home because

1042
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,600
You're not there

1043
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,160
That experience that you had and others had of

1044
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
Water

1045
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,488
Pumping out all day imagiknit pumping out for

1046
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:39,328
Multiple days or a week or a month who knows especially if it's an

1047
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
Winter Wear

1048
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,400
Freeze software testing that now

1049
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,192
We just roll that out to

1050
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:50,848
Another three hundred of our technicians to sell so it's something we're moving across the company and trying to help consume

1051
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,616
Numbers in different ways

1052
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,687
So with the Wally product this is a zigbee

1053
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,711
And

1054
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
Play face Enterprise

1055
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,295
Search for anyone who's in in can you buy this

1056
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
Somewhere else

1057
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
PS on Amazon

1058
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,415
You can go to Wally home.com it is zigbee and Z-Wave

1059
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,231
Both are Hub zigbee and Z-Wave so our devices

1060
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:11,327
It really made up of a hub water sensors and the water valve it

1061
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,375
And zigbee and Z-Wave

1062
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,167
They're so and we can kind of

1063
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:21,567
Operate both ways it also sets us up to be interoperable with more platforms which we're in conversations

1064
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,639
For that as well

1065
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
My goodness

1066
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,687

Switch

1071

I think it's really interesting because there's a huge hole in the market

1072
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:38,719
For installations for a lot of these connected devices so talk to me a little bit about

1073
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,743

Into HVAC very soon

An infinite World of solutions

That will be able to provide

1105
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
Because the

1106
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,183
Needs of

00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,743

Example I use all the time

1110
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,887
Is 10 years ago

1111
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
Very very few

1112
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
People would have ever knew

1113
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,983
Needed an electric charging station

1114
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,007
Electric car charger

1115
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,287
Sensation in the garage

1116
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
Today

1117
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
The car almost everyday

1118
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,407
And that's something one of our electricians

1119
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,687
Could

1120
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
So

1121
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,991
It's just one example

1122
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,039
Of this ever-changing world of needs at your

1123
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,855
It doesn't mean that something is

1124
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,415
Broken here servicelive can provide

1125
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,951
DIY charging station isn't

1126
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
Problem it's a no

1127
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Opportunity

1128
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:19,583
It could be something as simple as you need someone to come out and hang your

1129
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
Lights the holidays

1130
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
A seasoning

1131
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,423
Come back out and take them down

1132
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
So it's not

1133
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,983
Doesn't have to be all hi tech

1134
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,775
Servicelive is

1135
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,311
A broad array of services

1136
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,359
But we are excited about in barracks

1137
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
Excited about

1138
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:32,895
What can happen

1139
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,687
Because

1140
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,247
I think everyone would agree iot is a

1141
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,551
Exciting but a lot of people don't understand

1142
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,087
Homeowners

1143
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,135
They kind of know they want it but

1144
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,415
How do you put it together

1145
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
So

1146
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:48,511
On both service live as well as our

1147
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,535
Home Appliance Tech

1148
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:53,887
Conditions are vision for that is that we could be think of it as a trusted advisor

1149
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,655
For this model

1150
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:59,263
When we could go into someone's home which were in millions of times a year and

1151
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,567
Help guide them through do I need

1152
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,151
3 cameras where would I put them do I need a door lock

1153
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
Do I need a door

1154
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
Bell

1155
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,967
Do I need a Wali

1156
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,271
In my home of course you do

1157
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,063
And that type of

1158
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,623
Are trusted advisor type of

1159
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,695
Assistance is where I want to take us we're not there today

1160
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:21,023
But we have to have that Vision to go forward and that's where we're headed

1161
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,607
Okay let's talk about some of the opportunities that you're seeing

1162
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,143
So right now

1163
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,447
What are the most common installs that you

1164
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
You get for smartphone

1165
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495
Devices

1166
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
See if thermostat

1167
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
Thermostats

1168
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,335
Very common

1169
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,127
And now the doorbells are bad

1170
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Becoming very calm

1171
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,199
And how much training do you need me this

1172
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,503
As someone who is installed a lot of this stuff

1173
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,039
And tried to get it all to work together

1174
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,575
Impossible soul

1175
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,111
How do you train these people

1176
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,135
This feels like

1177
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,671
Just a huge area of

1178
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,975
Previous angst so I don't know what it is for

1179
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,559
World Service live We Are

1180
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,583
Creating relation

1181
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
Recruiting

1182
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,143
Third-party provider

1183
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,703
So we'd intentionally go out in

1184
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
Chic

1185
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,007
Providers that

1186
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,287
Have these skills are

1187
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,591
And what we are is a connection with

1188
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
Consumer that need something need something

1189
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
Installed

1190
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,991
And the provider that is there a resource so will you create

1191
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
The connection between

1192
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:14,783
Supplying them

1193
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,087
So we're not doing that

1194
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,391
We go find people to have that tree

1195
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,927
You can connect them with

1196
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,951
Either our cost

1197
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:26,047
Timer for service live also has a a white-label aspect to it where

1198
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,071
We have Partnerships with

1199
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,607
Companies that have these

1200
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,375
Devices

1201
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,167
More than just iot device

1202
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,703
Anything that can be installed

1203
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
Several things

1204
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,751
Looks to be installed at home

1205
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,543
And we create the connection

1206
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,591
Queen that company in providing

1207
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,383
A resource for their custom

1208
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
Burnett case

1209
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,687
When you go inside

1210
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
What are they at

1211
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:50,111
I feel like I get bombarded by a crazy use cases all the time

1212
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:50,879
But it's

1213
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,439
So far the consumers are not like oh yeah

1214
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,207
I totally won

1215
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,047
Well yeah I think

1216
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,095
You know every day that education

1217
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,119
Improves by

1218
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:06,751
The smart home space is still a little bit of a mystery to a lot of homeowners so a lot of the questions we get our

1219
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
What connects with what

1220
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
Because

1221
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:14,431
Does my camera connect with my thermostat which connects with my

1222
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,967
Wally let's use that

1223
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,039
And I think that's a mystery for a lot of people I think bull

1224
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,111
Moving that direction we're not there yet

1225
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:25,183
To be able to be that trusted provider but that's the vision that I have

1226
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,719
And that's a big question

1227
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,535
You know people that I know just in my personal life

1228
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,839
As you know I've had a connected home

1229
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,887
Home for a long long time now

1230
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,959
A lot of people that I know don't and that's one of the reasons

1231
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,983
Stay it's

1232
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:41,567
A little confusing so we want to be sort of an educator and

1233
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,151
Trusted advisors what I usually call that but

1234
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,943
Where we can educate consumer

1235
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
Rumors of

1236
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,735
How it all fits

1237
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,039
Cuz once you understand

1238
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:55,903
It's more than just having a camera is what the camera can do for you it's more than having a thermostat is what

1239
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,927
Thermostat can do 4

1240
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,975
Thermostat can save you

1241
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,511
Money on your energy bill

1242
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,791
If you have it

1243
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,583
Install properly and setup

1244
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:07,679
But if you don't have those other two pieces it's just a therm

1245
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,495
We want to help people get the most out of

1246
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,519
Iot devices

1247
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
As well as

1248
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:13,823
Understand

1249
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,359
How to put them all together

1250
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
Okay

1251
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,687
Well I feel like I've learned quite a bit

1252
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
Today thank you so much

1253
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
For coming on the show

1254
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:26,879
So thanks for having me on the show I appreciate that we're really excited here at Sears Home Services about the future

1255
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,183
Probably more involved in iot and

1256
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,975
Helping consumers in new and different ways

1257
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,511
So thanks again for having me on

1258
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,559
That's it for this week

1259
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,095
