00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,984
Hey everybody is Stacy

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,056
Higginbotham if you are listening to The Internet of Things podcast

3
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:16,128
We are back and here is my co-host

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,408
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,224
Welcome to the show

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:25,088
We've got a lot of news today we've got some exciting Gadget reviews and we have a great guest

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,904
Who actually is also the CEO of the gadget company

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,928
So we're having a gadget

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
You are

10
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,120
And I'm a business gal and acatic how so many

11
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,472
So let's get started with the exciting news that is not exciting

12
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,752
Actually it's kind of sad

13
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,080
That's a terrible Segway so ninja blocks

14
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:50,432
Company out of Australia that was making a really cool

15
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,712
Home hub

16
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
Device

17
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,272
Call the Ninja sphere

18
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,808
It looked kind of like

19
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Heck it looks like an alien ship that was

20
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,672
Landed on your coffee

21
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:05,024
Table basically it was part Spear and part pyramid they called it a Stearman

22
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:11,936
They did and we had we had Pete Moore who was a co-founder of the Ninja sphere

23
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,496
Made by the company that made ninja blocks

24
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,616
On the podcast about a year-and-a-half ago and he talked about kind of

25
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,944
Thinking of his thinking about the market and designing this thing and

26
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,016
Kind of the differentiating factor about the ninja sphere

27
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,064
Was that it used gesture

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,624
Controls that used EMF actually

29
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
To figure out

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,000
Where your hands were in in the room

31
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,072
Seafood Chester to the ninja sphere to turn your lights on

32
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Or

33
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,960
Actually was mostly used for lighting but I thought that was a very nice you I think

34
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,616
Cuz it it kind of conceited it maybe you don't have your phone on you all the time and maybe you don't want to pull it out of your

35
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
Pocket

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
And open it up and

37
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
Turn on your lights

38
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Comedian

39
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
This is true

40
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,112
And I tell you it was an interesting looking product

41
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
It was really expensive I'm in a hit

42
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
Carbon cost of a normally do but

43
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
$249

44
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
It was a bit much I think

45
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,352
It was it was expensive and so what happened

46
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
They wrote a blogpost about it

47
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
They ran out of money

48
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
They

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,544
They spend a lot of time developing the sphere

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
And

51
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Basically

52
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
They

53
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
They couldn't raise their next round

54
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,016
And all but 300 of the Ninja Spears were built in box

55
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
And the ready to go

56
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,344
So they are going to ship those

57
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
If you ordered one

58
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
And you didn't

59
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
If you ordered one and

60
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,280
You're one of the 300 that

61
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
I can't make

62
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,376
They're going to prioritize those by those who

63
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
Ordered more than one

64
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,008
Set the ordered multiple ninja Spears you're probably only going to get one of them

65
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,592
And they're hopeful that maybe they'll get

66
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:00,224
Somewhere someone nice will give them additional money to get those last three hundred

67
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,088
If you bought from the site within the last few months you'll be getting a refund

68
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,880
And

69
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,464
Kickstarter backer Kickstarter backers will receive their Spears

70
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
I'm in

71
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,536
Sanders

72
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
Yeah it is sad

73
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
And

74
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Yeah

75
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
That is

76
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
That is sad

77
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,128
And there's the only other thing I would like to point out is they did talk about like the cloud cost because

78
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,432
How to make the ninja blocks

79
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
They have

80
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
Scale back some of the

81
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,160
Features and servers associated with the ninja block service

82
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,720
So they're going to try to keep that as well

83
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
To keep that going as long as possible

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,864
So you should expect it may go down

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
But they're going to let you know before

86
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,984
And that's kind of an interesting conundrum for anyone

87
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
Who buys into some of these cloud

88
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
Back products

89
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,920
I was just going to say that we've talked about this past shows how

90
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
I kind of prefer to have a

91
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,040
A Smart Hub in my house that's not really cloud connected but

92
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
More something that I'm in control of

93
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:13,952
Because while this is one of the reasons I think there's a couple of the reasons that I would prefer that but this is a Big E

94
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,280
It is in you know Cloud connected services do

95
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
Kum & Go it's it's very hard

96
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,143
I guess if you don't have a big back or two

97
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,959
Even if you do have to be back or Sony actually

98
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
There's a internet

99
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,055
Austin's 404 kind of Tumblr that

100
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,127
Tracks this sort of thing there's actually not that many products on it but

101
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,223
Sony's aibo robot I don't know if you remember the robot dogs they were like

102
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
2005

103
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
2006

104
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
Been around awhile

105
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Sewing

106
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,415
2014 they finally took those offline officially

107
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,463
So they stop supporting them

108
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
There no more

109
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,327
Little doggies

110
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
They put him down

111
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,215
I flipped a switch and put my puppy down

112
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,055
Companies don't support their products forever

113
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
That is the moral here

114
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
So sad news

115
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
I'm for the ninja blocks

116
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,479
I Spy

117
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,039
I think they did it the right way they were very transfer

118
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,719
You know you can feel in their posts that they wrote that they were kind of bummed about this whole thing

119
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047
They're doing what they can and they're trying to let

120
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
What does

121
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
So

122
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,239
There we go now we'll move on to

123
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
A big company doing something

124
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
I don't really know if

125
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,103
Happy or not it's just a big company doing something

126
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,175
Today at The Internet of Things World Conference in San

127
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Cisco

128
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
Samsung

129
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
You may have heard of him

130
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
Has launched a

131
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,879
Series of chips called the Arctic chips for The Internet of Things

132
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,975
Benton done in competition with Intel

133
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
Qualcomm broadcom freescale

134
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
Nxp

135
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,327
All the other

136
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
Atmel

137
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,447
Really every building tips for The Internet of Things

138
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
So there are three of them

139
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
There's the Arctic

140
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,335
1 which is a

141
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,151
Tiny little looks like in MCU

142
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,991
Bluetooth and A9 access

143
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
Sensor looks like a

144
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
Nine access

145
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
Gyroscope accelerometer

146
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:22,207
Addison's motion sensor on there on the Arctic. IO site

147
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
Okay

148
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,279
And that is running

149
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:30,143
Embedded artists the nucleus OS its artists from mentor Graphics I know that

150
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:35,263
I've heard of other companies using this there's a good Chilean million artists out there so

151
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
Is that your flavor of the month

152
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
That's what it's running

153
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,663
And that's design for really small

154
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Things

155
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
I don't know if it would run in watches that's my guess

156
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,575
Watches kind of things designed to work with the phone

157
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,135
And then the bigger versions

158
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
AR

159
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,255
Downtown and smarter phone is kind I think maybe

160
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
Smart Hub and

161
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
Door lock

162
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,519
It's hard to say it's hard to say me when you look at the the specifications for the Arctic 5 in the Arctic 10 you start

163
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
Getting close to a glow and smartphone

164
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
Processors here in Reno

165
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,431
Dual core and octa-core arm chips

166
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,271
512 Meg memory or 2 gig of memory

167
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
You get the addition of

168
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,671
Zigbee and Wi-Fi the 802 11bgn flavors

169
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,487
So you start getting you no more until

170
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
It was like a low on smartphone

171
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,375
But this is the Internet of Things Kevin so we're Thinkin thermostat

172
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Connect sub

173
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Yeah

174
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Feel like

175
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Smartphones

176
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:42,847
Police seem pretty powerful force a thermostat or something I mean they're talking about

177
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
Hardware video codecs you know of

178
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,783
720p decoding at 30 frames a second for the Arctic 5 in

179
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,087
1080p video decoding Sullivan

180
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,951
But it seems like overkill for a thermostat I don't know what they're going to use these for

181
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Well I mean maybe if you

182
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
You stick it I mean if you think about

183
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,095
Kind of a connected wall plate for example

184
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,399
You might want that to run

185
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
That's what you just can't

186
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,287
Maybe not Netflix but you might want to run videos who's at your front door or a tree

187
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Brown birds

188
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Your canoe

189
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Office

190
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
I have no I

191
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
Sew in

192
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
Honestly

193
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,063
They're probably I assume they're repurposing

194
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,903
I think I read somewhere that they're repurposing their exynos line

195
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
4

196
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,487
Chips so

197
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
It makes sense that

198
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
It might be a little Overkill but

199
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,215
You start out with some intelligence in one place and you never say Kush

200
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
I wish I could do less with

201
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,847
Whatever says that

202
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,919
Not nothing you typically not a good strategy for business no

203
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
So

204
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,735
So that's what these are and

205
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
On the OS side

206
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
I was kind of surprised

207
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
I don't know if you were but

208
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
They aren't running tizen

209
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,047
Yeah that does surprise me because you and I sat at that it's a small world keynote at CES were

210
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,095
Samsung song about Internet of Things

211
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,679
And we're all going to come together in one ginormous Global Group Hug

212
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,263
And Tyson's going to be the platform the ties it all together for Internet of Things

213
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,079
There's no mention ties at all instead it's all

214
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,151
Yo Arduino that uses nucleus OS

215
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,735
Programming in Java and C + + +

216
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Yeah

217
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
Where's the worst Eisen

218
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,343
I don't know but there is so there is

219
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:34,975
For development environment on these chips they do support groovy which is what the SmartThings

220
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,303
Home hub is using in SmartThings was bought by Samsung

221
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
For those of you guys out

222
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
There who are like

223
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
High on SmartThings

224
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,239
That is the Samsung chip announcement

225
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,615
Well we'll move into broadcom also it internet-of-things world had an announcement that

226
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,431
A lot of people might be excited about

227
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,271
One is a chip that does faster Bluetooth CC speed of

228
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
Give me the rates

229
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
Yay

230
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,647
That'll actually be good in your watch

231
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,487
Oh please hit need to let me just say that right now

232
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
Because all the appdata on the Apple watch coming from the iPhone it says it's faster sometimes for me to just blow the phone

233
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
I kid you not

234
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,215
I wouldn't doubt that is this the first generation

235
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,567
I probably excited about is the

236
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Is a software

237
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Platform

238
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
On top of it

239
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Chips

240
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
4

241
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
Developers and

242
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,343
This one they're adding homekit to it software platform

243
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
And as part of that

244
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
It's called wicked

245
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
Platform

246
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,999
They're supporting homekit

247
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
And

248
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,375
We're kind of reading in between the lines are actually we're not it talks about it directly

249
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,703
It talks about how it's supporting the bridging strategy

250
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
For homekit

251
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
And basically

252
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:57,919
It talks about having the bridge and capability to connect in points that are not homekit enabled

253
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
Yay

254
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:05,087
Yeah in fact they specifically Give an example they say this was a product like a bluetooth smart light bulb

255
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,391
To connect to a Smart plug containing brockhampton

256
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
Protons wecan module

257
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,511
Creating a bridge from the bulb to the homekit supported app on there

258
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
IOS device

259
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
So

260
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Dairy Queen

261
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,863
So yes and it says

262
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
It'll make it easier for customers

263
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,239
Using Siri or iOS application stink

264
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
Patrol

265
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Homekit enabled

266
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
Just kidding

267
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
That's not that's not in

268
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:33,247
I got all excited like I could use Siri to control mine on home can not yet not yet

269
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
Not yet my suspicions would be Apple products

270
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,647
Woodforest support that and then Applewood opencv upload more

271
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
That's the hope

272
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Apple stuff

273
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
Now

274
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,351
So that's that's kind of the big news for this week I can't think of other big news items

275
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
So here we got sadness

276
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
And we've got chips

277
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
How about a little

278
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,543
Joyous light bulb

279
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Review

280
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:03,967
Joyous life reviews I love it so yeah it last week I sent Kevin I had the shoe folks send Kevin's

281
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:09,087
Some light bulbs so he could actually get in on this internet of things and smart home stuff that we always talk about

282
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
It's about time right now

283
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,695
It is about time yes I did not have to unpack her like my own

284
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Stuff

285
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
From my

286
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
Move that didn't happen last year

287
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,095
Instead the Hue bulbs were sent here alone with a bridge

288
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,399
You were right on the last year you said this and take me like

289
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
5 minutes to set up

290
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:29,055
Kudos to the folks at Hugh because it took even last time I mean literally

291
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
Pulled out the

292
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,431
Raspberry Pi that I have connected to my home router over ethernet

293
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,271
And I plugged in the hue light Bridge instead in its place

294
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:42,879
Literally press the button on that had tube light bulbs already turned on screwed into the

295
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
Various textures and boom that was it

296
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,023
I never just a matter of getting the apps but Hue app on my iPhone

297
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,351
And I'll be honest I like the Hue app

298
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,935
Far better on my phone that I do on my Apple watch more than a second

299
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:02,079
You obviously said Stacy you've used up the Hue app so you know what it's like you can

300
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,151
Pick the color of any and all lights you can change the

301
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,223
Brightness on any of them so I was having fun with that

302
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
The iPhone

303
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:15,391
And then because I do have an Apple Watch it says hey we got Apple watch sport do you want to put that on your Apple watch I said sure

304
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
It's kind of limited

305
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
I'd say it's more like the

306
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
Like a widget

307
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
Basically did

308
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,935
Literally you pre-load certain scenes for your lights on to your Apple watch if you got off on the phone

309
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,263
And then when you go in the Hue app on your watch you have those scenes

310
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
I just have them

311
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
And the lights change so

312
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:39,199
You can't control brightness there I would love to see that digital Crown be a nice little

313
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,503
Raise or lower the brightness level

314
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,063
But maybe that's not possible just yet so

315
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,391
It is early days as you said the Apple watches version 1

316
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,975
I don't have to use my phone to actually change the colors of the lights are

317
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,023
You know cuz I can do that from The Watch

318
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,607
But it still has a little bit of control to be desired yet

319
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,263
Have you seen on other watch apps a little bit less of the widget feeling more of a true

320
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
Absol

321
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:09,407
You know I didn't look for I know there are other third party app

322
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,967
But I really just wanted to use the native

323
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
Hue app to give it a full

324
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
Taskus

325
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,903
I think most people who buy these bulbs are probably not going to go search around for apps are going to follow the instructions in the

326
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
In the cat and if they are going to go get my

327
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,999
My app from for iOS or Android

328
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
I don't know if they're going to venture beyond that

329
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
Oh I was thinking more

330
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,167
Less specific and more just in general on other

331
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
Apps

332
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
Okay well

333
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:38,591
Play honestly the only true native apps on the Apple watch a really those from Apple itself

334
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
Even though with the watch

335
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
Kid platforms available

336
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:48,319
Developers can't create native app so basically what they are they're all extensions of iPhone apps

337
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,879
Right now meaning they're very much like widgets

338
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,207
You can do notifications and glances and such but again

339
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,839
I'm seeing more of them that look and feel just like the widget you might add to your

340
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,399
Your notification screen on iOS right now

341
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,191
It again early days

342
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,007
Apple hasn't really opened it up yet for

343
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
Richer functionality

344
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
Okay

345
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
So now

346
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,455
Edwin Sumo CA an insteon review

347
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Right

348
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,271
You just you just wet my appetite

349
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
Now I want the insteon

350
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:27,743
I'm kind of tired from screwing any three light bulbs to be

351
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Describe my life

352
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,839
It's on my to-do list

353
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,399
I look at my Apple watch in the to do zits on there

354
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
There we go

355
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
I can't wait to see

356
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
All right

357
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,055
I will report back actually on me

358
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
On the Amazon Echo

359
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,967
In the house just a quick little reporting back I've noticed it getting a little wonky or lately

360
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
Hue Lights

361
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
In the last

362
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Week

363
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
It has been

364
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
It has responded when I asked it

365
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,231
To turn off the lights

366
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,815
It said okay but then it doesn't turn them off

367
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
So

368
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,935
It's it's kind of interesting I'm trying to figure out what is going on on the back end

369
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,519
Or maybe we need like a full reboot of the system

370
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,335
I don't know so

371
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,431
I reached out to Amazon to try to figure out what might be happening

372
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
On the back end

373
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,783
And I guess I should reach out to you as well

374
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
I'm just to see it because

375
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
And then I'm curious readers

376
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,511
I guess you could be listeners listeners noticing the same thing if you got this

377
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
You know tight end

378
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,863
Let me know info at iot podcast

379
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Dot-com

380
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Because

381
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
It's a little weird

382
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,263
Cuz it it had been working perfectly and now it's getting a little

383
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
A little laggy and a little

384
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
Iffy

385
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
So

386
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
Silly silly Cloud systems

387
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
I know how do I reboot the cloud

388
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,783
Okay so we're going to start a new segment on the show

389
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
We're going to see how it works but we're calling it

390
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,183
It's in the spirit of it podcast and other clever naming

391
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,999
The 5-minute device review

392
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:10,143
What will it be let's see probably five minutes of device review

393
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,703
Where to take 7 minutes and talk about flowers

394
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
So this is

395
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
5 minutes

396
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
On a device

397
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:21,407
I haven't actually time this so it may actually not be 5 minutes may take a little more a little less

398
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,967
But this week's device is going to be

399
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
The Mayo

400
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,807
And demaio is an armband

401
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
That you guys

402
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
You put it on your

403
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
Forearm

404
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
And it is a gesture control

405
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Device

406
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
It is brand new

407
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,815
Well it's actually not that day was about a year old

408
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:43,423
You can buy it now from Amazon and you have been able to buy it for the last

409
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
Couple months

410
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
4

411
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,543
$199 it's from a company in Canada

412
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
And

413
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,103
It's called Thelma claves

414
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:58,783
And they sent me one because on Thursday they're announcing basically that you can now use them IO to control press

415
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Presentations

416
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,903
I have been excited about the Mayo since it was announced back in like

417
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
2013

418
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,999
Because I think gesture control is really fascinating

419
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,071
I've been playing with it all the way back in

420
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
2012

421
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,399
Thinking about like using

422
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
A disco

423
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,495
A disco kind of rmotion till I turn on my lights

424
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
Party boat I thought I'd be like

425
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Superfine

426
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,639
Even then Stacy was hooked on the lights

427
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
Even then yes

428
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,199
I'm I'm hard to live with

429
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,063
And in my disco our motion is is over-the-top completely

430
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
So

431
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
I just did

432
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:38,463
There's a place for gesture in the home and with the Internet of Things

433
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
So when they announced this I was like huh

434
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,559
This could be really interesting

435
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,655
So having tested it for only about an hour or so

436
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,751
I think it's too much money

437
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
To spend on a very limited use case

438
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
Unless

439
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,383
You have

440
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,199
Severe Mobility problems

441
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,623
The presentation thing was not as interesting to me because they don't give a lot of presentations that I actually think if you were giving a

442
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
A lot of presentations

443
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,207
Some of the gestures like double tap in

444
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
Making a fist and rotating them

445
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
Would actually be very distracting

446
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,375
4 people watching you give the presentation

447
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
It would be kind of like

448
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,775
What what is she doing up there why is she doing that little weird mining dance thing with her arms

449
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
But

450
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,615
You can actually assign mouse keys to

451
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
De Mayo

452
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,711
And keyboard keys to the Mayo

453
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,271
Fairly easily and that's what I was playing with

454
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
And so you can actually

455
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,391
Instead of like clicking on your mouse

456
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
You can actually

457
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
Assignment

458
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,767
This rotation so instead of a double tap

459
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,559
I assigned a fist rotation

460
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,375
Is that was actually kind of fun

461
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
It wasn't

462
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,935
Exactly practical

463
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,983
I think I would have to spend a lot more time

464
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
Figuring out the

465
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,359
Smoothest Jester and then training myself to actually

466
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,663
Instead of using a mouse just using

467
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,967
Tamao and my body

468
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,991
Right

469
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,551
We had a lot of promise and

470
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
Since I have

471
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,135
Especially towards the summer a lot of carpal tunnel

472
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:17,535
I thought it might be worth it cuz I actually spend 75 or 80 bucks on like a really fancy

473
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,351
Sideways Mouse

474
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,679
Another hundred and something on

475
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,983
Dragon dictation software so

476
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:30,079
Yeah I think you're hitting the nail on the head I see this more as a

477
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,359
Essex

478
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,943
Tool for people have limited Mobility because this doesn't just

479
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,783
Just measure how your forearm itself is moving but as you said

480
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,319
You can make a fist you can

481
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
Do different

482
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,135
Gestures at the finger level

483
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
Because they're

484
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,951
Special

485
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
It has sensors that

486
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,023
Can actually track finger movement as well

487
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:55,423
So that there's a lot you could do with it and for somebody with limited Mobility I could see a lot of value here

488
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
Exactly it

489
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,495
Because what it does is it

490
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
It rests right in your forearm and it's actually

491
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
It seems

492
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
Pretty comfortable to me

493
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919
I don't know how long the battery last

494
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,223
And it does take up a USB

495
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
Port for the Bluetooth

496
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Connectivity

497
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
If your if

498
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,623
Short on ports that something to think about

499
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,440
End

500
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,256
Like the tapping there's there's

501
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,560
The finger motion there's fist

502
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
And then there's like a

503
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
Lego

504
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,168
Forward backwards risk music

505
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,960
I meant with your hand that's kind of

506
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,264
Fun and useful and I'm not sure

507
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
Again

508
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:38,432
I haven't I haven't played with it enough for set up the right sequence that I would feel comfortable using it all day long yet

509
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,016
It's definitely worth playing with

510
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,064
Or something like that or even

511
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,392
I would be really interested in getting a physical therapist

512
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,440
Play with it and set up

513
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,304
Something for me or for someone who's having a hard time using it

514
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,840
I think that would be kind of

515
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,144
Definitely worth paying for it if you

516
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
Could set up something effectively

517
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:04,544
Sure I could see potential industrial uses as well robotics

518
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
Control and such like that

519
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:12,480
Picnic, collapsed at that you should get a full day use out of a single charge so the battery should last you all day but

520
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,552
I don't say how much of a day that is in constant use or

521
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,856
Occasionally yours about the day so

522
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,392
My mouse uses

523
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,672
Pretty constant so

524
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,512
I did not I did not have there is no Disco

525
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
Disk arm movement

526
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
Unfortunately

527
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
I'm going to have to wait for

528
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
For something to do

529
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
Control my Hue Lights

530
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,472
There is also a developer

531
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:38,080
Platform for that so if you want to play with it and you have $199

532
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
You go right ahead

533
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
If you have

534
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,480
Some technical Little Star

535
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
Will be excited

536
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,576
Maybe I'll try it

537
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
I'll try

538
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
Your app out

539
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
So

540
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:58,816
Are just coming up is Andrew Thomas who is a co-founder of skybell which is a

541
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,608
Wifi controlled

542
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Doorbell

543
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
That shows you who's at your door

544
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
And they're part of the

545
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:09,056
Bevy of startups that got the deal with Comcast last week there also homekit partner

546
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,384
So stay tuned to hear from him about kind of

547
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:19,296
How he got those deals and kind of the choices he's had to make because of them and

548
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:25,696
I think that's it so we'll see you next week sounds good

549
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:33,632
We have on her show today Andrew Thomas who is the co-founder of a company called skybell

550
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,656
Hey Andrew

551
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
Thanks for coming on the show

552
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,008
Hake fish is absolutely thanks for having me

553
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,824
I am super excited because

554
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
You make a product that

555
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:49,760
Actually I want I really wanted one of these for a while and I've tried a couple in have been a little disappointed in summer

556
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,600
A couple of yours but couple of other products in this kind of

557
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
World Of Products

558
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:58,464
So you make a connected doorbell that offers a camera

559
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
And when someone

560
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,536
Ring the doorbell

561
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:06,656
It sends a notification to my phone and it also can send me a video

562
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,448
Yes exactly

563
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:14,080
Skybell is a wifi-enabled video doorbell and it replaces your current doorbell

564
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,152
And I don't actually have to be on my Wi-Fi network in that case

565
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,688
That's correct

566
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,480
Absolutely you can be

567
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,368
UPS guy just leave it at the door.

568
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,928
Sign for it

569
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,000
Exactly

570
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,792
Calling you if you don't leave it there

571
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,632
There were there we have it I could beg maybe it would happen

572
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:44,032
The skybell is available for 199 you can buy it on amazon.com

573
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,848
Bestbuy.com and if you want to see it in person

574
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,152
Have to go into a Best Buy store

575
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:54,016
We're having on the show because this week you guys actually just signed a really big deal or I think it's a big deal

576
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,064
You signed a deal with Comcast

577
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:02,720
And you are one of nine actual Partners in their Xfinity home business and

578
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,792
I thought it was kind of significant what did you think about this deal

579
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
I didn't get to marry

580
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
Significant

581
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,704
About the announcement and CVT fluid in

582
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,752
Xfinity home announcement

583
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,336
I need a Comcast has a great plan for

584
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
Answer

585
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,456
You know the market and the team is focused and they have

586
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:32,928
More security for their plot on by letting their users know who got their door

587
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,000
Animal Control

588
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,304
You may be above all else.

589
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
Their attitude about the

590
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,376
Space

591
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
Secondary

592
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
Ashley Nissan

593
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,728
Trinity 2

594
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
Creative very nice Seacoast

595
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,336
And they have always prioritized

596
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,408
A user which is very important for us to so

597
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Are same values

598
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
Nursing priorities on

599
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
Finding out how to

600
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:04,160
Create a truly good user experience and presenting it to their subscribers and

601
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,464
Responsible

602
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
Or a little

603
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
As they want

604
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
And

605
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,864
So we wanted to be a part of that

606
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,656
Excited about it

607
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
Got it so you guys

608
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,264
Now have this Comcast partnership and before

609
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,312
This you are also a

610
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:25,664
An apple homekit partnership I recall seeing your your name up in lights

611
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,200
Last

612
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,736
WWDC

613
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,552
On stage in June and

614
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,344
That's a big deal to so

615
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
How are you kind of

616
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,024
Managing all these Partnerships are how are you kind of thinking about how you're going to sign these Partnerships going forward as a

617
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,072
Start up with kind of limited resources

618
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
That's a great question

619
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,960
The Apple announcement for homekit was

620
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,752
Almost a year ago now

621
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
It was

622
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,824
Such a big moment

623
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,616
At that time

624
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
We work

625
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,944
Just barely under a year old

626
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:03,040
Six months removed from Shipping our first product

627
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
Sky Valley

628
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,648
Included in that keynote presentation

629
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,000
Left us speechless it was such a big moment for us and it was

630
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,304
It was a big validation for

631
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
Geico

632
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,632
The device but I think also skybell

633
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,216
As a group of people who want to make a great product

634
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
How people

635
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
So I think they

636
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
Validated

637
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,896
The company in division

638
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
Omniscience

639
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,016
Answer your question how do we prioritize

640
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,576
To work with the best company

641
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
In the world

642
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,952
And our goal is to get Sky those on more home so that people have

643
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:46,304
The security mean a feedback we get some people just continues to motivator

644
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
Forwarding

645
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,656
And we've already been apart of preventing a couple of break end

646
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:55,264
And when you get these stories it just motivates you want to get high though

647
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Von Maur home so

648
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
And when you look at

649
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,128
I can do retail item

650
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:04,480
Partner with people I can look at resellers what we love about Sky balls at

651
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,784
We can participate in all of those

652
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
Go to market Channel

653
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,136
And someone can go to Best Buy and just say

654
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,696
Autographs

655
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,536
That wants to be part of a greater whole

656
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
The Naked Bee

657
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
Your home care

658
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,376
Smother clowns

659
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:25,728
I'm working it out staying or they can say I want someone to come in and help me

660
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
Comcast

661
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,312
Come help me and you take care of it

662
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,848
Set it all up for me

663
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,688
Ridgid work perfect I want to reach people every way

664
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
So for us

665
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,296
Having these two companies who are absolutely top in their class

666
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
Just phenomenal

667
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
And

668
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:47,744
As we move forward we're going to continue looking at the best companies and what can we do with them too

669
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,792
Create good user experiences

670
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,936
You'll raise money and build a table supporter

671
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,984
Are they decent

672
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,056
Validate user company and used to think that

673
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
Top priority

674
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
2

675
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,176
Have the resources

676
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,480
If it's bigger deals

677
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
Will let me see cuz

678
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,344
In previous conversations you've actually told me about

679
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,488
Kind of when apple called you up that first time to tell you about being a home kit partner asked you about it

680
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:24,608
Because you know they didn't put your name up on stage without letting you know first thank God you might have

681
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,144
I don't know what would have happened

682
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
So why don't you

683
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,312
Tell us about that because I mean for any company in this space

684
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,200
Having Apple give you a call and say hey you want to work together that's probably pretty cool

685
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,016
I don't know if they've never called me up and said hey you want to work

686
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
Together

687
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,856
Absolutely right

688
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
It was

689
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,672
Really cool I mean

690
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:52,000
That's that's what you want right so when we

691
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,096
Start a company

692
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,888
Next to Wi-Fi doorbell so

693
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,936
People can see who's at their door

694
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,264
We had an idea who we wanted to work with

695
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,312
And he's already I wouldn't it be nice

696
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
We did that

697
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,408
Basically

698
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
13 +

699
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,784
Nanjing 2014

700
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,600
So literally

701
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
Island paperwork

702
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,208
Spell announcement was made in

703
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,256
Yes I have that happened

704
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,048
In between those two

705
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
X.

706
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,168
One by we got the message and

707
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,216
I first had that conversation

708
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,008
And they come to you right

709
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Track

710
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,336
Big they reach out to us

711
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,664
We were only a couple months old

712
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,248
It was just starting out an Indiegogo and finish

713
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,832
It was just amazing and we just didn't think that would happen

714
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
So quickly

715
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,904
And have them

716
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,952
Reach out to us to just save

717
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,232
We love what you're doing

718
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
And

719
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,096
Don't why don't we start having

720
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
Conversations

721
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,752
Curly it is

722
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,128
We just weren't we couldn't be happier in

723
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Incredible

724
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,088
So speaking of all of this I have to ask you and

725
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
When

726
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,392
When is Apple

727
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,208
Going to actually release their home kit product

728
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,024
Estates at the top one

729
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,584
I don't know if

730
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,424
I'm going to space where I can answer that for you I'm really sorry but

731
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,216
Yeah but have to plead the Fifth

732
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
Sofitel B

733
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
You have to kill me

734
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
Is that is that what I'm hearing

735
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,432
Yeah that's what I'm about

736
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:52,320
I even like how you're he won't even threatened to kill me here in the here on the podcast you're so that you're so nice

737
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:56,672
So I will wait for then I will I will keep my

738
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,976
My I will wait for my Apple products

739
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
And

740
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,560
Maybe maybe I'll cross him off my list of things I'm

741
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,608
I'm hoping for for Mother's Day

742
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
So

743
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,680
We're probably going to be waiting but

744
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,960
We want mines because

745
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,544
When it comes out we're just going to be like this is awesome

746
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
All right

747
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
What will keep that in mind

748
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
So

749
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,200
Let's let's talk a little bit about

750
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:25,344
Kind of the limited resources and we'll tie this in with the Apple stuff because you had mentioned

751
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,904
Set design apple has a huge focus on design

752
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,488
You guys have had a huge focus on design your your product is actually

753
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,512
Very attractive

754
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:37,632
It does not look like a 3D printed monstrosity that you know I've duct taped to my door

755
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:44,032
Actually my duct tape things to my door cuz that's just how I roll but my

756
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:44,800
Improperly

757
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
That's how he rolls

758
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
So

759
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,408
With the resources that you have

760
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,296
How have you made your decisions because a lot of the companies who are in the space that are startups

761
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,880
They did they don't have infinite resources so how do you make

762
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,696
Decisions on what to focus on cuz

763
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,232
Ace Hardware is hard

764
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
And so

765
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,840
What have you guys decided to focus on and why

766
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,168
Absolutely right Hardware

767
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,960
Hard work was hard enough

768
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,008
When you just needed to make a product

769
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,544
NL Hardware

770
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,896
A product that has to talk to you

771
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,712
Smartphones and has to talk to platforms

772
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
And servers and

773
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,088
Are the days of making a product and putting it on the shelf or

774
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,952
So it was just a couple years ago

775
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,024
Restart WiFi module

776
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,816
Everything that we met

777
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
So

778
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:44,448
Big thing for us is when we need to go going to be raised $600,000

779
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,728
That was very helpful

780
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,776
Getting us the resources that we need

781
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,616
Experience making Hardware before

782
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,944
So we've been able to do this pretty Lane

783
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:00,576
Breaking too much money at early-stage to get through the first Federation

784
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:05,184
Prioritize how do we make the best video doorbell

785
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
And I think

786
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,328
We did a good job at version 1 and then we took a lot of theoretical feedback that we got there

787
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
Indiegogo

788
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,448
Combine that with the real world that we got

789
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,984
Conversion wine

790
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
And then we released

791
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
Version 2

792
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
So

793
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,128
For us we just been focused on

794
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,408
The video doorbell

795
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:29,504
Even before we thought about Integrations with companies in other products

796
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,552
We just said we got to make

797
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,856
Skybell is great as it can be

798
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:38,976
Skip it to give his many the feature that people have told us that they want we got to get that to them

799
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,536
Before we even integrate with other people

800
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
So that Focus

801
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,632
Till a couple of months ago

802
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
Skydive Chicago skyline

803
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,776
Crazy distribution offers

804
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,336
Call Wendy great if you did this and

805
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,872
This is a separate

806
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
Completely

807
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00,224
But it's always just been focused

808
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
Getting our progress

809
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,320
So that's that's how we do

810
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,368
If you can't make

811
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,392
Hyde Park

812
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
Same time

813
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,744
So we just went back to make one product extremely well

814
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,280
Animal

815
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
Next steps

816
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,864
And speaking of next steps

817
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:21,472
What kind of company where do you envision the company in a couple of years because

818
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,264
A lot of companies

819
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,056
In the space right now

820
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
Are stuck

821
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
Thinking about Amaya Product Company

822
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,688
Or am I really a data company

823
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
And I hear that a lot from

824
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,272
From start-ups so

825
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,064
Where do you kind of see

826
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,088
Skybell

827
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,136
What we are planning

828
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
Reaction

829
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
Smart Home

830
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
Security company

831
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,816
So you know what is home security look like

832
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
In the future

833
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,936
And that's sort of what we're focused on so we're starting with

834
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,496
You know about that

835
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:00,384
Gives you a great sense of security at your front door where a lot of people really want it and then

836
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,944
We do use data we do collect device

837
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
Status about weekend

838
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,784
Understand how people are

839
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,064
Actually using

840
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,624
And what's important for us

841
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,440
Limited resources you have limited power

842
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,488
So you can't do everything

843
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,792
So if I know users are

844
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,864
Are having longer video sessions or there

845
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,240
Then we can prioritize

846
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,032
How we allocate power outage

847
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,592
Or we can fireworks

848
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,408
Somewhere so that certain features

849
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,200
I'm a prominent and others

850
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,992
And we definitely done that

851
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,576
Still one example early honest we got feedback that people

852
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,648
Wanted the ability to turn off their indoor chime

853
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,184
So that

854
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,464
Baby bouncing house

855
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,304
FedEx UPS driver doesn't wake up their baby

856
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,120
Describe how you can hit a button

857
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,448
I don't know that turned off your indoor chime

858
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,520
That was all based off of user feedback

859
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,568
It's always

860
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,360
Great feature list

861
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,920
And so we just been doing that along the way and

862
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,456
It's been working out

863
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
I'm very well.

864
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,296
That's the word focuses and

865
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,856
Will keep using data to

866
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Prioritize

867
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:20,256
Teachers of people want in the people we know the features that people are using

868
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,120
I like it yeah I love I love that idea

869
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,168
Using both data and user feedback

870
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,984
To actually prioritize your future releases

871
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
It helps

872
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,336
Mitigate kind of the most vocal user problem

873
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:40,480
Cuz sometimes they'll tell say something but you cannot now actually look and see what people are trying to do and then you're like oh

874
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,504
Let's do this

875
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,064
You brought up an interesting thing though

876
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,880
What do you think security does look like in fiber

877
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,416
Let's just say five years

878
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,976
Would I have a connected home for example

879
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:55,328
I have a lot of things my security is now automated in the sense that

880
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,656
Devices in my house talk to each other so when I'm not home

881
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:03,776
It takes on the role of turning lights on and off or turning my shades of down

882
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,360
I'm in all of those are triggered based on certain events happening

883
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:12,992
So I'm just kind of curious like how a doorbell might play into that or maybe

884
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,808
Maybe your version of security is very different I don't know

885
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
It is lame s*** out of the doorbell

886
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,392
That would be awesome

887
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,952
And we just filed that actually

888
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
There you go see

889
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,792
Cocina

890
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,352
Yesterday's news

891
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,144
Find the real deal

892
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,984
Let's see if you don't have plans coming out of the door

893
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
You know five years

894
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,200
Yeah right now he's got a solution this type of 2G Wireless

895
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,272
Fortress around your house and if

896
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,296
Penetrate it

897
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,856
Then you know what call the police and I think

898
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136
There's always going to be

899
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,440
Trump's are not right.

900
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,720
Call monitor

901
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,256
Home security solution

902
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,280
Yes

903
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
I feel like

904
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,864
There are so many opportunities for

905
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,424
Homeowners to do exactly what you just talked about this

906
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
How do I appear

907
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,568
Eye exam

908
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,152
Kumon Mason Kenny support and help

909
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,272
So I see all of these preventive things possible

910
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,552
Because of home automation

911
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,112
Upper down

912
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,416
Team light coming on

913
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,464
At the same time

914
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,048
You can sort of customized security

915
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,936
This is what I need I don't

916
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,496
I don't quite need a $50 a month

917
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,776
Through your commitment

918
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,616
But what I really want is I want to know who's at my front door

919
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,408
I want to let them in remotely

920
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:49,504
And maybe I want to censor the backyard and something on the garage

921
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,552
Between us three products

922
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,600
At 6

923
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
I got exactly what I need

924
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
Got it alright final question for you

925
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,584
Just like this is like Final Jeopardy

926
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,888
How many seconds I don't know

927
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
No

928
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
So

929
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:14,848
Recently I think it was the Wall Street Journal there was a great article on this being kind of a bubble the smarthome bubble

930
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
It talked about

931
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:20,224
Products like connect to toothbrushes I I've actually tried one of those

932
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,296
There I think there was b-connected fart detector

933
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,600
That I have not tried

934
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:29,440
But if I were a teenage boy I would totally race race out its

935
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
Support that

936
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,280
As a company that is selling

937
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,304
You know

938
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,888
A connected device in thinking I'm sure you know

939
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,960
Probably think of yourselves as may be more valuable than

940
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,984
Connected fart

941
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,752
Detector

942
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,568
Little bit

943
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:54,016
I didn't think it's a good product for a certain demographic

944
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
Bubble in the space

945
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,160
I look at you know the ryzen platforms

946
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,488
Comcast is not making a secret of its interest here

947
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,816
Google has in a nest in his buying

948
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,632
Arbat Dropcam podesta actually

949
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,704
What do you think your future looks like

950
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,240
How do you how do you

951
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:18,592
Plan to do you plan to stay independent how do you plan to continue

952
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,968
I guess being the best company you are and I should also throw in there that Fitbit

953
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,088
Crazy Fitbit just filed for an IPO in what will be last week by the time the stairs

954
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
So

955
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
You know what it feels like

956
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:37,792
Wow there's a lot of really interesting opportunities here for a successful kind of connected device

957
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,120
I agree I think there's there's tons of possibilities

958
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,912
Sometimes I think that

959
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,984
A lot like how

960
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,520
Social media was

961
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,800

00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,951
People going out there and discrediting Facebook

970
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:10,559

Dog owners than

972
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,447
For me it's

973
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,799
We're getting articles like that because it shows

974
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
There's something here

975
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
Ricers

00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,863
It's for real when companies

984
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
Apple

985
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,983
Yeah Samsung

986
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
Google

Microsoft

988
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:52,799
Comcast

989
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,847
Involves all the ice p

990
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,711
Home Depot Amazon I mean it's everywhere

991
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,247
I don't think it's messed

992
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,783
Barely a bubble I think

993
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
We're getting a lot of

994
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,599
Good attention

995
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
Could skybell become

996
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,719
The

997
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,279
You know that I am in with Google buying nest

998
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,327
That was kind of one of the big kind of

999
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,863
Hopes for a

1000
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,935
Independent company that rises out of this kind of

1001
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,751
I want a bubble but this flurry of activity

1002
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,639
Add skybell be one of the big independent the eBay's are the Amazons coming out of the Smart Home

1003
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
In a flurry

1004
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,479
You know I never know what the future holds

1005
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
I think this

1006
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,551
What we have with skybell

1007
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,623
We have a lot of great things going for us

1008
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,439
Portmore very grateful to be in a position where

1009
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,231
Almost every

1010
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,791
Group that we've spoken to has reached out to us

1011
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:50,655
Because they know that having coverage of the front doors in the big part that's missing

1012
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,959
When I look around

1013
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:01,407
I see the one that do all that do something at get real valued

1014
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:06,527
Nest Thermostat helps people save money it's also really cool

1015
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,063
And it's really convenient

1016
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,599
Started

1017
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,415
Skybell gives you security

1018
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,231
Tangible real security at your front door

1019
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,303
Your parents feel more comfortable leaving kids alone

1020
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,583
So that they can

1021
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,447
And so

1022
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,519
You know our hope is to be relevant in a couple years

1023
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,823
We're going to continue looking at ways

1024
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
2

1025
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,383
Stop real problems

1026
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,015
Aspirations

1027
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,039
The gift people

1028
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,087
More real value

1029
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,391
So I think when you say focus on real value

1030
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,671
You can create life

1031
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,463
Company

1032
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,767
That's that's what I'm banking on it

1033
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,791
I know this

1034
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,863
Solutions that my staff

1035
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,399
Install problem

1036
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,983
And I know that there's something for everybody out there but

1037
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,615
What are meaningful impact that we can make some people

1038
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,175
I stay focused on the other sale

1039
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,967
Involved

1040
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,735
Security

1041
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503

Actually seeing the pizza guy from
