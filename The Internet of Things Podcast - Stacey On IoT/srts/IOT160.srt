00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,080
Does your host Stacey Higginbotham

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:18,176
And your co-host

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:21,248
Are you today about Microsoft's

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,528
Azure sphere

7
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,808
A new security product

8
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,624
Ross can we talk about you secure

Purity standards for the Enterprise for the online trust Alliance

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,000
We're also going to talk about

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,280
Apple acquisitions

12
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,072
Possible acquisition

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,120
New details on

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,656
What your August locks

15
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,424
Can talk to

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,216
Twilio has introduced a new

17
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,240
Iot product

18
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,336
We've got a crazy idea in transporting small pets

19
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,920
Kevin's going to review and talk about the fibaro homekit sensors

20
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,200
And our guest this week

21
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968
Zeke is gay

22
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,736
The hunt

23
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,016
Was actually

24
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,808
The Mastermind behind

25
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,088
Azure sphere

26
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,880
So we're getting a lot of detail on

27
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
Plus we got him

28
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,696
From our sponsor for sure

29
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,720
And now

30
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,024
Will hear a message from one of our other sponsors

31
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:12,448
Is you know me so you know me platform from the makers of the free you know me after you know me

32
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:17,824
Is a cloud-based platform-as-a-service for companies Building Solutions for the connected home

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
You know these offerings include a cloud a server list iot platform for device manufacturers

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
Get their products to Market quickly and securely and also you know me what a powerful integration engine that connects

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,024
It's more than a hundred top smart home devices this week on the Stacey on iot podcast

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,864
Hang up their five-part series what the next billion dollar smart

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,704
Home startup will look like you can find part for it part 5 today

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,848
By visiting platform. You know me. Oh Stacey on iot

39
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
Okay

40
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
Heaven

41
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
This party started

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
Microsoft

43
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,112
Yeah it's going to be fun to talk about Microsoft and not

44
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,648
Talk about Windows

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,976
Yes so everyone was very excited about this

46
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
Probably the most common headline I saw was

47
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,816
Microsoft

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,728
Yeah I doubt they did that pizza

49
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,312
Yeah they've actually done a good chunk of

50
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:26,432
Work on bringing Linux to Windows desktops recently which is great to see

51
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,272
Obviously this has to do with iot devices and seizure

52
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
Would you say that there

53
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,648
Using a you're creating a Linux embedded OS

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,928
Not exactly

55
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,280
This is only for the address fear is only for security

56
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,328
So I think that's a really important

57
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
To note so this is

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,656
Obviously going to talk about it later

59
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
Gary Bradley

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,752
Is a secured microcontroller

61
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,312
It is secured OS layer

62
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
On top of that my

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Microcontroller

64
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,176
It handles the back and forth between that

65
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,712
The MCU and

66
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
What is a

67
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
Secure

68
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
Cloud Elliman

69
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,112
So the OS is really just handling the back

70
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
And forth between

71
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
The hardware

72
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
And kind of

73
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
Brains and

74
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
The cloud seoul

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
What's Happening Here

76
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,560
Is the MCU

77
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,352
Who has a lot of the elements that you would

78
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
Expect

79
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
From

80
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Trusted

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
Cute environment secure boot Olive

82
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
What is also

83
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
Has is

84
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,824
It also has the certificate based on the

85
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
Sanitation

86
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
He's going to

87
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
Communicate with the certificate granting

88
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
In the cloud

89
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
End

90
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,528
Also in the cloud

91
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,832
His threat detection so when new

92
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Viruses

93
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
Abilities are detected

94
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
It's going to be able to

95
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Basically

96
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
The check goes in

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,328
Tell the chip and get having a secure patching ability

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Back down to the ship

99
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
If that makes sense

100
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
Yasso

101
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,568
Product self is the Azure sphere and then the cloud service that you mention that the security piece that's the address.

102
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,152
Security service in the cloud so this song

103
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:07,552
Which would not always understanding is there secure at all times

104
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
When they're not secure

105
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,136
And how to update the security on them

106
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,952
It has been a challenge so this should help with that

107
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
Yes this gives you 2

108
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
Detection audit

109
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Zation

110
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
There's a lot of things that gives you

111
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
Now

112
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,959
The issue here is Microsoft is doing this for

113
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
It's open sourcing

114
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
That's so it's open

115
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,591
It's trying to work with all the chip vendors to get this on

116
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
I'm bored and

117
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,711
Will people take it that's really the question there's plenty of

118
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,551
Chip companies that have their own security standards in them anyways that's part of the problem

119
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
Is it

120
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
Fragmented Market

121
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,439
You'll never hear someone say

122
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
It's not

123
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,839
This feels more in line with something like Samsung

124
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
Arctic which has they have their secure module

125
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,287
I'm curious with Amazon could probably do something like this

126
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,103
The free artist if it wanted to Overlay security

127
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Some of those

128
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Thanks right so

129
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,711
They would have to do a deal also with

130
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
What the Chip n

131
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
Letters to have the hardware

132
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
Comment sold

133
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
That's a little

134
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
But

135
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
This is a good

136
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
Model

137
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
It feels like a good model

138
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
And

139
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,303
I am excited to see if it works it's not retroactive though so

140
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Right right

141
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,959
You mentioned chip makers and trying to get them and Microsoft already has mediatek is one of the first

142
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
Companies to make peace microcontroller units you mentioned Arctic and that's the one challenge that Samsung doesn't have

143
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,199
Samsung does made chips are these designs chips and have some produce

144
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
So

145
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,039
If they wanted to do something similar

146
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
They could without

147
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Bering

148
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,879
Chip makers are going to come on board

149
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Secure

150
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
So

151
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
I don't have the block diagram

152
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
What

153
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
I can't get this

154
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Come back to you on that

155
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
We'll see ya

156
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,575
Problem

157
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,975
I'm sure that our guess is going to get into the details even further boat in one thing is worth stressing Riverfront is Microsoft

158
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
On the security aspect of this through address fear but the date

159
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
Sent to Microsoft azure

160
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,495
Yes and we talked about all of that and we even talked about

161
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
When you see this

162
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
And

163
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
How

164
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
Little bit about how the trip is made so

165
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Stay tuned for Galen

166
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Because he is worth it

167
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
Also

168
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
On the security front

169
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
We have the online trust Alliance

170
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Switch

171
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
Cool stuff

172
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,415
James a ringing endorsement

173
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
They actually created

174
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Several years ago

175
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,815
They created a checklist for what to do when

176
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
When you move from your smartphone

177
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,423
So how did I remember

178
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
They've created an Enterprise iot

179
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Security check

180
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,847
Quest best practices for

181
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,639
Things if you're going to have an iot Network

182
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,455
Your office and I won't call them to it

183
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
I won't go into all

184
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
There's about

185
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
11 or 12

186
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,927
You probably should have a guest Network or separate iot

187
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Yay

188
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,535
You should update all your passwords and don't use products with hard-coded password

189
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Yay

190
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
Some of the more interesting

191
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
Is

192
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,495
Don't allow or severely restrict automatic connections via Wi-Fi or other be

193
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,055
This will restrict the ability of other devices to

194
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Infiltrate

195
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
I don't know why

196
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
I feel like

197
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
That kind of defeats the

198
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
The purpose of

199
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,527
Some of these iot devices I don't know what

200
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
Well

201
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,463
I mean deployment of a society devices is always a challenge

202
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
It's simpler to Adam but

203
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,839
Obviously that's not a good security practice so I get what they're saying there

204
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:08,703
Enterprise as opposed to home so I can understand

205
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
Cover up all my

206
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,615
Disabled

207
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
So in my favorite one which we should all do

208
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
Although this puts the burden on the consumer

209
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
Enterprise or

210
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Consumer consumer

211
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,135
Is closely

212
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
From service when they are no longer updatable

213
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
More secure

214
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:35,839
So in this actually you I'll bring back the Microsoft thing cuz in my conversation

215
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Michaela

216
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
He mentioned that

217
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
The

218
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,703
MC user supporter for a 10-year

219
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Cycle

220
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
So

221
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
I was think

222
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,871
Supremes my washing machine stops being secure a sphere

223
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
10 years

224
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
But this

225
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
In the Enterprise

226
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,759
You've got similar sort of

227
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,319
You got some Thor gear this could be running around

228
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
4

229
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,903
7 to 10 years is usually the longest I've seen

230
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
These connected devices in their support

231
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,231
Contracts

232
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
Chilling at reasonable

233
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
It's reasonable but check

234
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
That's a challenge

235
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
If you'd like to see what you should be

236
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
Skipping riddle

237
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,031
Home security news

238
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,615
Called nice out of Italy

239
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,175
Is buying a 75% stake in

240
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Abode

241
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
Which is a home security system

242
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Lots of pee

243
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Love

244
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,903
The value of the 75% stake is 18.75

245
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Million

246
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
And

247
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
De stijl

248
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
Is

249
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,023
It's a good one

250
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
Fits with what

251
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Aldi

252
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,911
Smart home security companies getting purchased by

253
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
Barter companies

254
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
Such as

255
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
Ring

256
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
Who else has not been

257
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
Where she did see the iota

258
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Gateway

259
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
Fromm adult at CES

260
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,903
We did we did and then plan to sell that for $329 and would ship

261
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,695
In late q1 well

262
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,023
It's now early cute to and

263
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,839
This acquisition but no updates

264
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,495
Right it turns your Bose system into something compatible with

265
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,799
And if you don't have an existing

266
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
About system

267
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
You can buy that at

268
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
Add about pieces on

269
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
Security system

270
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:34,623
Supposed to work with nasty Kirby Philips Hue and lifx right out of the box I will see what happens if and when that shows up

271
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,183
Alright also in a position

272
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
Lucci

273
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
The maker of

274
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
Favorite light switches

275
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,607
Tetra which is actually an austin-based company that makes

276
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
Really fancy high-end

277
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Commercial lighting

278
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,983
Tetra is a company that was actually

279
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
Created by no suits

280
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Who was one of

281
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,615
Founders of silicon Labs so school Austin

282
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
Guy here

283
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Are the chip world

284
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,223
The cool thing about technology

285
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
They make

286
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
LED

287
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
Chips that

288
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Are in there

289
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,879
False so this actually give us

290
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
How to do it

291
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
I'll say it

292
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
Lighting

293
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
So they can make the

294
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
The chips that

295
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Make LEDs

296
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
The bulbs

297
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
And then the

298
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,471
Radio protocols that allow them all to talk to each other

299
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
And catchers

300
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
Unique because

301
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
The chips actually

302
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
Controlling themselves so

303
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,687
To the right color that

304
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
The company or the

305
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
Resident wants

306
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
They walk

307
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
Always stay that color

308
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
So apparently LEDs can pop

309
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
In-N-Out us

310
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
2

311
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
Dismiss apparently

312
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
So

313
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,399
Do you think we promised to actually get into the business cuz this is a very unique

314
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
Technology in LED

315
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
I

316
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Sync

317
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
So I've been to catchers demo

318
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
Maroon and Kesha's lights are in like

319
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,871
The Museum of Modern Art in Chicago

320
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
Some very fancy high-end

321
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Fun places

322
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
Lot of nice retail stores

323
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
I think this gets

324
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Flu shot into the

325
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
Commercial Lighting space

326
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
More so than

327
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
D

328
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
Cherry Crest Market

329
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
Yeah so

330
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,535
I think this is a smart move for them

331
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
They know what they're doing

332
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
In terms of like

333
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
And I think

334
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
Bringing their expertise from the

335
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
Consumer world

336
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,007
In the high-end home in dealer

337
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Which is why they started

338
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
I think this is really

339
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,127
Esprit Market

340
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Competition

341
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
I guess

342
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Phillips

343
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
Other big

344
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
I think it's a smart

345
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
Trap mix

346
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,999
No word on how much this cost

347
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
So sad

348
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,631
To hear that and I don't know if actually Lutron will suddenly have an outpost in Austin

349
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
We should be super cold for me

350
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
Granny backyard

351
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
This is true

352
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
All right

353
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
That is

354
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
We have

355
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Touted as someone who

356
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
Might acquire

357
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
Nokia's

358
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
Health division

359
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
Which we all know and love

360
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,719
Are used to know and love is why things

361
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,535
A little convoluted but

362
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
Leukemia

363
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,143
Now in February of this year they were like yeah

364
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
This isn't for us

365
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:37,151
Yes the internal memo explained the digital Health business did not look like it was going to be profitable for the

366
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,991
The company and they were evaluating what to do in February

367
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:46,879
I forget the quote something about failing fast isn't failure to accelerated learning what they said

368
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:53,535
Terminator was failing fast because things for $100

369
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,607
In 2016 and I suspect whoever guess

370
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
This part of their business it's coming

371
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,959
Be a lot less bright

372
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
A lot

373
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,519
Google makes sense to me

374
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,103
Only because

375
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,943
It could tie into their nest in the hardware teams

376
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,831
Also because and this is just my experience I try this several times

377
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,183
Google is not that great with Health Data Google fit in particular has just been

378
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:27,583
Wonky for me does not work and not synced with other services so maybe

379
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,983
Why things I peking come in there I don't know

380
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
That perspective to me I don't know what's going to happen obviously

381
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,639
Write another I think they also floated Amazon as a possible acquire

382
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,967
Which would be interesting because Amazon is launched that health initiative

383
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
Southwest JP Morgan

384
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
I believe

385
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,391
That we don't actually know what the heck that is but you know

386
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,695
Sew-ins

387
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
We have

388
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
Watch Dora

389
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:03,679
Yeah if you have an Apple Watch like I do I don't have an August lock you can update

390
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:10,079
And now just tap on your watch to unlock the door keep in mind I know the August has

391
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,407
Walk up to your door and have it unlock when you have your phone with you

392
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,967
This does not do that if he has cold smart unlock

393
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,527
This is not that this is actually just

394
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:23,135
Tapping on the watch to in the app to unlock your door so it's going to be clear about that

395
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,671
So you have to tap

396
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,999
The Watch

397
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:34,911
Yeah but keep in mind you can set to complications on Apple watch to be shortcuts to apps

398
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
R show data

399
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:42,591
So 1 tap to open up an app or two types of is pretty quick

400
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
Waiting for 5 seconds

401
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Also

402
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Twilio

403
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,807
It's now generally available

404
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
Programmable Wireless

405
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,183
Basically this is the ability to have a

406
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
Connected to

407
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,655
Places with a SIM card the last you provide SIM cards and service and they have pricing plans that are

408
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,447
Pretty reasonable

409
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,287
Maybe you want to create your own little iot sensor that connects to the

410
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:18,687
Weber something for whatever reason and it's remote he can pop a Sim in there and you know I have text messages sent to your phone

411
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:27,391
People who are do-it-yourselfers number one but there have been some companies that are using this they mention in their blog post

412
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
I did eat a bit and

413
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,743
Not a bit snow just kidding dwelo

414
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:38,399
Which is a cellular connected Smart Hub for apartment buildings but even the folks are just

415
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
Connected dashboard camera

416
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,591
They talked about using trulia's programmable wireless cellular

417
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
Iot devices

418
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,687
And Kevin has a brilliant idea

419
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
Maybe we'll send him

420
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:05,791
Bunch of mailboxes all together the front

421
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:10,143
Ascensor in there and then have it send me a text message saying your else here we could all do it

422
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,959
People

423
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
I'm sure Kevin

424
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
I'll tell you about it

425
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,639
I'm going to patent and sell it to the post office

426
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Hugo

427
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
All right oh also

428
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Now you can

429
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,039
Astra products

430
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:32,415
Yeah this is interesting I haven't taken it for a test drive but this is their VMware pulse iot Center

431
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:38,815
State of couple of Hands-On Labs where you can actually remote so you can explore

432
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:44,703
For the polarity center consoles dashboards you can manage simulated IRT

433
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:49,055
So this is a way for them to educate people on their product to manage devices

434
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,871
Latex free to access the lab zombie run through

435
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
These things

436
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
I thought it was kind of cool looking Kurama

437
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
And

438
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
Prayer since summer is coming

439
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,063
Kevin also found

440
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
The video is cheesy

441
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
Peta safe so this is how to transport your pet

442
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
Safely

443
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:17,471
Yeah safely right it'll actually help you if you have not said you're moving across the country and you were going to take your pet on the plane

444
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:22,079
Unfortunately

445
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:28,479
Or you're going to have a transportation service take your pet will digipak for example has a company that uses this

446
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:33,343
Technology and use RFID tag tracking

447
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,159
To basically monitor where your pet is

448
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:43,583
Temperature yeah they can even help you

449
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,679
No smoke

450
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:54,847
Not everybody transports their past but I just thought it was a cool Easter Vallarta to the summer sometimes

451
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
That's nice

452
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
Bring your dog with you

453
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
So

454
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,271
If I use it I'll let you guys know how I found

455
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
All right and

456
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
Kevin this week you reviewed

457
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,647
Homekit sensors from fibaro

458
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:15,583
It was time to look at home kit stuff since I just moved everything over to SmartThings so I have the $60

459
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,983
Sbarro door window sensor and the $70 fibaro motion sensor the eyeball

460
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,567
They're pricey but they're very well-designed

461
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,895
They are very responsive easy to set up in home app

462
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:35,295
For iOS for automations I have the door window sensor literally from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.

463
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,855
In the office and shut the door the light just comes on

464
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
Can you open the door to leave the light goes off

465
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,487
Obviously you can use that for security as well very configurable

466
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,047
I'm a little concerned about the batteries only because the

467
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,143
The knot standard like double a triple a kind of batteries that sort of unique

468
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,959
Tomorrow said they should last two years so

469
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:59,359
If that's the case then it's less of an issue I mean you pay a premium for good design while working

470
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,967
Cancers that don't just do what they claim to do the motion sensor and the door window sensor

471
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:10,367
Also report temperature which is Handy and the motion sensor can tell you the brightness

472
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:15,487
Set a room in terms of Lux so you might be able to make some custom automations based on room brightness

473
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,791
Open my shades

474
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,119
Mapleshade's and I believe you actually

475
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,655
If you want to do something like that

476
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
And you can see the Lex on the home app

477
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,823
Yeah then you could do that with Lutron Serena shades

478
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
Hunter Douglas also has a shade that works with

479
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,175
So if you're

480
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,967
Eager to try something like that out

481
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Which

482
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
I would be

483
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
That's actually kind of

484
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
I think so too

485
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,879
Allright basal temperature actually

486
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
Bring the sheets.

487
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,023
All right well now it is time

488
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,071
Are iot podcast

489
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
Listener hotline

490
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,983

491
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,287

Ashley

497
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,903
Maker of electronic locks

498
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,000
Schlage smart locks work with most Smart Home & security systems

499
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:24,352
You can get the most out of your life whether you're an Apple homekit user or you just love Amazon

To see what's possible visit schlage.com

501
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,448
To learn

502
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
All right this way

503
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
Hotline

504
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Question

505
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Comes to us

506
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:40,992
Hello my name is. I live in Louisville Kentucky and I've only been listening to yourself a couple weeks now

507
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,064
Into the home automation

508
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
I love you so

509
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
But what I'm wondering is

510
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,928
Is there a

511
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,488
Video doorbell system that work

512
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,304
Being good for someone in an apartment building

513
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,608
Who does not have the ability

514
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:01,472
A wired system because there is no existing wire

515
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,264
Thank you for your time

516
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,592
Okay Scott I wish this were longer answer

517
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,360
Because

518
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
Then you have a lot of choice but

519
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:12,736
There's really only one choice out there for battery powered doorbells today

520
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,296
I'm going to recommend you don't go and buy

521
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
What are some of the no name brands on

522
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
On Amazon which

523
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
Are out there but don't do it

524
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,440
A Lot of Things Fall Apart

525
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,232
Genki to have terrible apps

526
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512
So your options

527
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
I really rich

528
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,912
Ring the original for $100 or the ring video doorbell

529
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
For 200

530
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:37,824
And the video so what that price difference will get you as a slightly different camera

531
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,872
On the video doorbell 2

532
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
It doesn't have his wider field-of-view

533
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
But it is high resolution

534
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,992
The other thing is

535
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
The battery pack

536
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
For that one is

537
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
Rechargeable

538
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
So

539
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,368
You just take it out

540
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,416
And you can actually buy an extra battery pack

541
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952
I want just like alternative

542
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,488
So some people find that way more

543
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
Convenient

544
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,792
Lie by Rihanna

545
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,888
Original video doorbell is also rechargeable but you have to

546
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,424
Take the whole thing off

547
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
Retarded

548
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
It's a little less can be

549
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:12,640
Yeah if you're not in a rush Scott I would consider waiting to see when the

550
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:19,040
Blink video doorbell arrived it was coming out in 2018 we last heard still says coming soon on their site

551
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,368
Blank was purchased by Amazon so I don't know if there's any changes

552
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,232
That will also be a battery-powered option I know they announce the price

553
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:32,864
Previously but now there's no price listed on the site so I'm not going to Hazard a guess that may change

554
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
So there you go

555
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
You can wait

556
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,032
And you don't mind a little inconvenience

557
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,080
You can always swap it out later

558
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,872
So there you go also

559
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Nest

560
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736
Hello doorbell speaking of doorbells

561
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,016
I found

562
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
It difficult

563
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
Because

564
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,832
It just was not connect

565
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
I have the

566
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,624
Darkness time

567
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
Connecting my Android phone

568
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
To this thing

569
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Which

570
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
We did get someone who

571
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
Call Dustin said hey

572
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,816
I get that problem sometimes too

573
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
Doing what I do is like

574
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
End

575
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,448
That person I say you are so right that is it

576
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
Exactly what you

577
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,264
When you have an Android phone

578
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
That is not

579
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
2

580
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
Turn off

581
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
Mobile data

582
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
Usually

583
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
Horses things to go

584
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:27,136
But I would also say eating with iOS because when I had problems with my ring that's what they had suggested originally

585
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,976
In the case of the nest

586
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
Do that

587
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
It did not help

588
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,840
But other people have said that they installed on an Android phone

589
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,144
No problem so I am just a special special

590
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,216
Which does not surprise me

591
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
Okay

592
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
Do you want to call

593
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,872
To The Internet of Things

594
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Hotline

595
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,944
Please dial 5 1 2

596
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712

597
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,528
37424 and leave us your question

598
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,064
And now

599
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
Because I'm feeling like I'm

600
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,672
Cleaning Out My Closet

601
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
If you guys

602
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488
Call and leave a message

603
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
You'll be registered to

604
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
My old camera

605
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:14,496
Got an SD card for those of you guys who don't want to send your stuff to the cloud

606
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
Thursday

607
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,824
And some sensors that you can actually connect to it

608
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
And

609
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,152
Have the camera go on when the sensors go

610
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
Or off or however you

611
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
You want to set it up

612
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
So that is

613
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
Yay

614
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
And now

615
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
Stay tuned

616
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:36,512
For our guest

617
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,608
Break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor

618
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:47,008
This week we have been Goodman Innovation at 4

619
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
What is 4

620
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,664
Our scale flexibility lets our customers move Beyond

621
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,456
Traditional Enterprise I-10

622
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:01,088
Typically people use identity management tools for things like provisioning employees

623
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
Is access to corporate applique

624
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:08,256
We like to do a lot more but we also do things like the authentication security for your bang

625
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:12,864
Cellular network or for connected cars or even things like connected

626
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,912
People doing really cool things

627
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:19,008
When it comes to digital transformation by leveraging for trucks technology

628
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,872
Okay and what are the challenges with identity management today is that it's applied

629
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,968
To so many things or maybe it should be applied to so many things

630
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
How are you guys looking at that more

631
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,088
It's a great Point there's this Rush right now

632
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
How to get technology to mark

633
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,464
And I think as technology just keeps moving faster and faster

634
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,864
The reality is that securing identity is Austin after I thought you know you hear these stories about

635
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,888
It has thousands

636
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
Sensors on

637
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,704
Collect all this data

638
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
Enjoy your day start with

639
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,776
Something like that

640
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:56,384
And they don't think about okay how am I going to secure that day. How am I going to secure that

641
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:00,480
And we're also seeing is that you know the government and the regulatory

642
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,808
Climate can't really keep up as well and so you see things like

643
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,856
In Europe they have gdpr which is

644
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Privacy regulation

645
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,952
In there and it was probably yours too late

646
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,488
Yet it's ahead of

647
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,536
Pretty much where anyone else in the world is

648
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,328
So how does identity manager

649
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
Actually

650
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,448
Identity if used properly is like magic

651
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:24,544
It's one of the few technologies that can actually improve customer experience

652
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,872
Why actually making their interaction more secure

653
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:32,224
So I didn't he is also one of the few technologies that is future proof

654
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
The reality is

655
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
In order to

656
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
Secure something you must identify it first

657
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,672
And if you think about it no matter what the device is identity persist

658
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,208
You always are who

659
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,768
Who you are and your thing always is who it is

660
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:48,096
And so are people realizing this and building their products

661
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,120
With that in mind

662
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,192
I think this whole concept of identity in

663
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,984
Security being an afterthought

664
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Is starting to

665
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
And quite frankly

666
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
We're working with

667
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
Consumer electronics companies who

668
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
Are now thinking about

669
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:07,040
How they create an end-to-end identity driven customer experience so from when you order it when you put it on the first

670
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:11,904
They provide a better customer experience but they also make the device more

671
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,976
We're working with large Industrials that are building

672
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,280
Command-and-control iot Networks

673
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
Stutter making sure that

674
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:23,424
Since Inception that they ensure that everything is secured all the way from the chip

675
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
The Clown

676
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
Sounds good so where can we go to find out more

677
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,056
To learn more about what you can do it

678
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,872
What our customers are doing with identity

Digital

683
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:44,416
- identity

684
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:50,816
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house

685
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,120
And today's guest

686
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
Is Galen hunt

687
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
Who is with Microsoft

688
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,960
Hey David how are you

689
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
Good

690
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,752
It's great to be here

691
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:02,080
All right you guys are at RSA where Microsoft just announced

692
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
A pretty big product

693
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,432
Azure sphere

694
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,224
Coming for a while cuz we talked

695
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,808
Last April about some of the core ingredients

696
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
What is azure sphere

697
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,440
Azure sphere

698
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:21,024
Is an Ambien solution for device manufacturers

699
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
Who built

700
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
MCU micro

701
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
Controller based devices

702
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
Allows them

703
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
Build devices that are

704
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
Connected

705
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,216
The internet

706
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,240
Highly secure

707
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:36,128
You might ask you what's an MCU or what kind of devices use those are museums to use our

708
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,664
They're in everything from

709
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,736
Toys to Home Appliances Industrial

710
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,576
Factoring equipment and basically none of them are connect Jets

711
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,136
Huge transition

712
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:50,208
Over the next couple years of all these devices

713
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
All right

714
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,816
So yes Galen as you might imagine is correct

715
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:59,680
Guys out there we talked about computer usually talking about processors

716
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,448
Your phone

717
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:07,360
What we're talking about with microcontrollers are all the as the arm m-class devices although there are plenty of

718
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:15,552
Things in your washing machine and and yes they are getting connected to the internet so you guys are created a secure

719
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
MCU

720
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,624
There is also a secure OS

721
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,416
In a secure cloud

722
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:24,000
Opponents of the idea is that this microcontroller

723
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
Who actually used to explain

724
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
What is happening

725
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,864
If I do we need all these

726
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,936
Well if you remember but when we talk back

727
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,496
We talked about the seven properties

728
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,776
Highly secure device

729
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,360
That was a paper that we wrote released

730
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
The year-ago

731
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:44,736
Basically we looked at from our experience at Microsoft building devices

732
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
What is NASA

733
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,552
Build an iot device

734
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,832
Stanolone

735
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,624
Internet device that is highly

736
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,696
To address those seven properties

737
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,024
You need three pieces you need Hardware support

738
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
Software support on this device

739
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
And you need

740
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
Collaboration with

741
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,632
Cloudtail Pecos

742
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
And that's what we've built

743
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
We built azure

744
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,240
Sphere are these

745
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
3 LM

746
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,056
So there's a new class

747
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:15,456
MCU sphere certified MCU these will be built by our silicon partners

748
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,248
Is not getting the business of building

749
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,552
Sailing ships we do however have

750
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,136
Pablo Acosta silicon IP blocks we have Microsoft

751
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,672
Security technology

752
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
Developed

753
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:29,792
That we put into every single one of these Azure sphere certified ship

754
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
And that gives a hardware rooted Trust

755
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,888
And the second element is the

756
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
Spear operating

757
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
System

758
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,496
Defense-in-depth multi-layer properties

759
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
System that

760
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,080
Create a very secure environment on the hardware

761
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
For the song

762
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,176
Temdan the third aspect is the

763
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
Azure sphere security service

764
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
Security service

765
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
A broken trust

766
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,368
Between hydrosphere devices and other devices

767
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,512
Cloud it monitors for emerging then to text emerging security threats against the devices

768
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,584
Across the entire ecosystem and it renews this

769
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,888
Security on the devices through software update

770
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,680
It's new security challenges come out

771
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,008
Okay threat detection and then

772
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,824
Renewing Security on the chip what's happening

773
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,872
Well okay so we'll talk about

774
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
Software update

775
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,480
When a device is out there

776
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:25,600
And it's some music 33 it emerges or maybe even someone finds a bug in some peace

777
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Coats on the device

778
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,416
You want to be able to

779
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,952
Create a patch for that and

780
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
And get it out on the coast

781
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
Devices

782
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
Do it reliably do

783
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,864
Attentively another every device you build it out in a field

784
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,144
Is now running the latest

785
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Software

786
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,752
Security service

787
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
Provide the

788
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:49,152
Does it also do things like signed update sign patches does it

789
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,176
Check for that

790
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
It's all apps

791
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,552
Yes so it

792
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
I'll just talk about one of those

793
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,368
Vulnerabilities in which town

794
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,648
In Microsoft experiences

795
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,720
Version one of your software is out running on

796
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
Sounds like you figure out

797
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,816
Security vulnerability

798
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
Guitar version 2

799
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,632
Well Packers will

800
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:14,240
Try to trick the device into instead of running person to the rollback version 1

801
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,568
Bill Clinton

802
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
Is rollback

803
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,408
Protection in a way that we can

804
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,968
Physically Modified by blowing some fuses

805
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,736
And the chip

806
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
Say hey

807
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,320
Don't ever run version 1 ever again

808
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,600
Vulnerability

809
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,160
Wow so it's kind of stone self-destruct button

810
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
For a particular version software you

811
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,304
You guys originally worked with mediatek

812
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
On this hard

813
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:43,424
How can other companies become Hardware Partners or is that

814
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
We have a program

815
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Working

816
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
With

817
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,312
As many silicon partners

818
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,432
Over a dozen companies were working with right now

819
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,968
Detecting the first partner

820
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,992
You're the first one that's coming

821
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
Market

822
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,296
And what we do is we go out and

823
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,856
We are licensing royalty free

824
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
AR

825
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,416
Security technology for the chip

826
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,696
And that's so that

827
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,976
The Spinners can use it

828
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:13,376
MCU Market very different from like the PC market in the regard of

829
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:17,984
Maybe you can I come at 3 silicon providers for the processors in the MCU

830
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
Market 32

831
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
Jasmine

832
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,360
And so in order to provide app and

833
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,408
Breath and get a solution outfits

834
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
It will be an everyday

835
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,736
We realized we were going to have to life

836
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,600
Give them

837
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,416
What's called an IP block that goes into their device

838
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
We get them

839
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,976
Sports teach them how to use that

840
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
Appropriately

841
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,048
And we also work with them.

842
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,072
Validate to take

843
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,632
Put it in writing put the rest of the architecture

844
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,168
Ship correctly together

845
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,448
It really is

846
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,752
Secured and then we certified

847
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,288
We let them put the address

848
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,336
Sphere brand on that ship

849
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:59,712
How does this compare with something like arm has their trust Zone that they recently extended to MCU

850
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,016
There's nxp has I can

851
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
Remember what they're

852
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,368
Secure module stuff is called for their kinetis lines

853
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,904
In the MCU world

854
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,976
Everybody right now has as you said roll their own

855
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,512
Compare

856
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,536
Coexist with

857
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,608
Ours is a solution that we have

858
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,400
Built based on the Learning Zone

859
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,680
15 years of

860
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,960
Security

861
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Game console

862
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
And in that game console business Microsoft concert

863
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
Three generations ago

864
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
Consul

865
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Justice

866
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,640
Significant

867
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
Amounts of money

868
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
Security

869
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
Console

870
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,760
Clear Lake to prevent piracy

871
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,296
But in the process

872
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,344
Doing that we learned a lot

873
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
About

874
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,208
What determine hackers will do how far they will go

875
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,512
And what kind of defense mechanism

876
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
Eaton Place

877
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:51,936
And then we took that learnings and created this it block that we are using I think one of the things that stands out

878
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,752
Compared to some other Solutions is that

879
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,800
It really has based on this

880
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
Many many years

881
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,664
Experience dealing with very persistent very determined

882
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,224
I guess another way to describe it is

883
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
It is built

884
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,832
Shoe function with the address Pier operating system

885
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,368
And the Azure sphere

886
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,416
Security service

887
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,440
Optimizing

888
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,744
Fire system in the end

889
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,816
So the all the pieces work together perfectly

890
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:25,728
So if I'm a customer and I'm like hey this sounds awesome I totally want to go and get these devices

891
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,288
Never worried about security does that mean that I

892
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
If I buy

893
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:33,920
This does that mean all of my date that these chips are generating get sent to

894
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,992
The Azure iot Cloud eventually or could I use

895
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
Another

896
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
Or keep it on premise

897
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:43,648
That's a great question as I mentioned before you were really committed to open this

898
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,280
But we don't actually

899
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
Hold your data

900
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,632
Connect to whatever cloud service

901
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,216
So if you that you're running proprietary servers

902
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,008
On-premises Enterprise

903
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,544
Will you connect to them

904
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,104
Are you connect AWS or Google

905
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,432
Or I am or Azure iot hub

906
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
Shroud

907
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,808
Obviously you want to make it as easy as possible

908
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
Thatcher

909
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:16,928
Created a fantastic very easy to use while buried and freeway

910
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:21,024
For people to use Azure cloud services for their date if they want to but we don't

911
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,840
Let's talk about Azure sphere

912
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,864
But I buy it

913
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,400
Have you guys would I buy

914
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,168
The chip Inn

915
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,472
Can force from the chips

916
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,544
The way you

917
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,336
We would purchase address

918
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,384
Fear is you would go to your

919
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,176
Distributor

920
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:41,504
Spirit certified ship and whip it would come bundled

921
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,320
The license for the Azure sphere operating

922
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,904
Come pre-installed on the ship and

923
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
The rights to use the azure

924
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,976
Security service

925
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,512
Or attend your lifetime

926
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,816
At the one-time transaction

927
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
One-time pay one cost

928
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,912
You get the operating system

929
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Security service

930
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,960
An ongoing service

931
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
Prices for that

932
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,800
Okay so let's talk now about

933
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,104
Macro iot thing

934
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,176
One of the big things that we

935
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:15,040
We talked about a lot is this oh my gosh are we going to do everything in the cloud to do everything at the edge

936
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,576
It's probably going to be a bit of both

937
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,112
Depending on your use case

938
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,672
This feels like a very cloud-centric model

939
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
Because

940
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,768
Sending my data from the secure MCU up to

941
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
The cloud security

942
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
Development

943
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,656
How might I build this to work in borovan

944
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,936
Distributing in Bayern

945
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,216
It may not have

946
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,800
Always on or even reliable connectivity does that break this model

947
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,616
We have to see the clouds in a very important element

948
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,688
Microsoft message

949
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,480
Talk about the intelligent cloud

950
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
Intelligent

951
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,576
Azure iot

952
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:55,232
That allows you to take computation you normally run the clouds and bring it down locally in the environment

953
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
Stare

954
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,864
Container ship that's offline

955
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
The time

956
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,984
Factory you don't want to shut down your after shutdown your product line

957
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,520
Just because you have lost your internet can

958
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:13,152
And so have the capability bringing this coffee tastes very very vocal as well

959
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:18,016
Am I correct in understanding that this will work with Azure iot Edge

960
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,808
Yes absolutely

961
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
And

962
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,856
Would it work with some

963
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Other

964
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
Edge Computing platform

965
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:24,928
I'm not using

966
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,952
Iot Edge

967
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,744
It could be made to work with enough

968
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,048
Platform

969
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
We got it

970
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,376
Chicken got an operating system

971
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,168
And we provide an API

972
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,192
Programming.

973
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,216
Chips and

974
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,264
Or giving you internet connection

975
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,080
TCP IP connection TLS connection

976
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,384
Programmer to program

977
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,920
The actual device

978
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,200
They're open today

979
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,224
Program

980
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
Execution

981
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,552
Local device they're open till

982
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,648
Whatever local devices are other things in the environment as well

983
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,464
In why is Microsoft doing

984
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,232
What is

985
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,792
Obviously we care a lot about iot security

986
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
White in Turkey

987
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:07,168
What is a hardware platform in a Linux distro which is kind of crazy for you

988
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,520
But you don't participate in the it

989
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,848
Think about I guess Jeff back and think about

990
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
Descendants you

991
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,944
Billions of these devices

992
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
Coming on

993
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,600
We look at it cuz they that the Technologies of people are using right now

994
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,880
Free azure

995
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,928
Those devices are not going to

996
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:30,976
Security nightmare

997
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,512
And we looked at it

998
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,048
Start this project

999
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:34,816
4 years ago

1000
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,352
Looking at that eclipse

1001
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,448
Future that looks like a very scary future and saying

1002
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,496
Yeah we have the technology

1003
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
We have

1004
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
A lot of

1005
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,616
Experience we could that kind of do almost started the research

1006
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,664
Could we take everything that we've

1007
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,200
Learned a Microsoft about

1008
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Security

1009
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,016
And figure out how to package unit

1010
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,856
Such a way that it could be used on these very very small devices

1011
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
So that we lived in a secure where

1012
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
And that's what we create with that

1013
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,512
What year was kind of

1014
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:08,608
When I talk

1015
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
It was reason is Galen wants to live in

1016
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,312
The security is out there is out there for him to use

1017
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
I could not get it

1018
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,896
So we're bringing the Technologies to make those

1019
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,200
Microsoft

1020
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,992
Ultimately a corporation

1021
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,528
Responsibility

1022
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,624
But we see is if there are many of these devices and their

1023
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,648
Picture and people

1024
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,512
They will be part of Cloud solution

1025
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,560
So they will use cloud services

1026
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,680
Are all of the Azure service

1027
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,752
So we see tremendous economic benefits there

1028
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:51,360
Okay so what are the things that you cited several times in relation to the creation

1029
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:55,199
This is your seven properties of Highly secure device

1030
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,247
Just briefly letsrun

1031
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
Okay soda

1032
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,575
7 properties

1033
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
Margarita Trust

1034
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,927
Then defense-in-depth

1035
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,207
Small PCB

1036
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,743
A trusted Computing base

1037
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,279
Dynamic compartments

1038
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,815
Certificate-based Authentication

1039
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,607
Online are recording

1040
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,655
And renewable security

1041
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,447
Yes okay

1042
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
So

1043
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,287
Let's just dig into a couple of those that people might be like what

1044
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,335
Compartmentalization what does that mean

1045
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,871
Okay I love this

1046
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:27,455
The compartmentalization is actually probably almost one of the oldest

1047
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,735
Security Technologies

1048
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
Known to man

1049
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,807
And this is the idea of

1050
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,111
Having multiple layers of Defense

1051
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
Having

1052
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,671
Separation of concerns

1053
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,719
Example

1054
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,559
Compartmentalize with Floodgate one part of the ship

1055
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,583
Because there's a lake

1056
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,887
That doesn't just fill up the entire ship

1057
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:51,263
Buildings where we have firewalls inside a building if there's a fire

1058
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
Prevent it from property

1059
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,103
Lego Back to the Future cast

1060
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,151
If you think about all that s***

1061
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,991
One of the most important lessons we've learned at Microsoft about security or less

1062
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:04,063
20 years is that it isn't a matter of

1063
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,343
If I will get her

1064
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,623
You will get high

1065
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,415
Make sure to buy some version of your device

1066
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
Question

1067
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,487
When your device

1068
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,327
What are the medications and what how prepared are you

1069
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,143
It's a building compartment actually end of the chapter

1070
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,935
Self and the operating system

1071
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,983
Allows us to if

1072
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,031
Partnership becomes compromised in summer

1073
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,823
That compromise

1074
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,127
Compartmentalize they can't go any further

1075
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:32,479
And then we can use the rest of the ship and the rest of the operating system and software

1076
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,759
To build restore

1077
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,527
Security.

1078
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,111
I'll even go a little bit farther because one questions you might ask

1079
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,647
These chips are different

1080
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,183
The traditional MCU

1081
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,231
We brought in a cortex a class

1082
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,791
Processor in addition to the cortex M class

1083
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,607
Non-exempt to use for the very first time

1084
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
The reason why

1085
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,471
Because it gives us Dynamic compartments

1086
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,519
Traditional MCU

1087
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,311
Aesthetic Apartments I have like

1088
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,383
Maybe at TruStone and then one other Lakes

1089
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,175
Willie two compartments on the chair

1090
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
And so

1091
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,783
You can't change departments like after you've been out and employment if you figure out the

1092
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,807
You custom music

1093
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,623
Security vulnerability or some news form of attack

1094
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,415
Like with a device been out with you

1095
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,439
Light years

1096
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,975
And some new

1097
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
Security attack is

1098
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:20,351
Embedded we can actually change the compartmentalization

1099
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:26,495
In the device by years after it's out in the field and mitigate against and prevent that attacks will be you

1100
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
Wow

1101
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:31,871
That sounds awesome but it's also brings up these are not chips

1102
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,431
Battery-powered devices the song

1103
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
It's going to consume

1104
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
More power

1105
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
Glass chip

1106
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:40,831
Well one of the innovations that we get so we partnered very early with

1107
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
Arm

1108
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
Building

1109
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,951
Figured out

1110
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,023
Scout II with their help to construct an a class

1111
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,047
Processor

1112
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,351
It is much lower power and

1113
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887
Smaller area

1114
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,447
10 people traditionally associated with the cortex 8

1115
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,031
And so we will see battery power

1116
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,055
Address to chips

1117
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
All of this sounds

1118
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
Really intriguing

1119
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,663
My biggest question

1120
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,199
With this is forever

1121
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,223
Going for

1122
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,527
Is there a way to retrofit some

1123
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
Space force

1124
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Are all healthy

1125
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,087
Millions

1126
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,159
Hundreds of millions of connected devices that are already
