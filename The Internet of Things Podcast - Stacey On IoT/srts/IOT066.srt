And Kevin today may sound a little fire away but that's because he's in the midst of his move and you're talking on

7
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,296
What are you

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
I'm using a phone headset

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,672
18.4 in

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,792
Android tablet call the Samsung Galaxy view which is a little ridiculous when you think about it but

11
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,864
It suits my intended purpose which is to use it

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
Kitchen

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,936

Kevin always has crazy gear

17
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,688
I mean I have crazy gear but none of my gear actually does

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,712
What is supposed to do

19
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,736
His does

20
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,296
Distance backflips no no

21
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,880
You could have it do backflips but then it probably wouldn't work as

22
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,672
You could do one back

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,440
What

24
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:07,584
So this week in the podcast where you be talking about the end of I-5 and how did end of life

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864

Two camera

33
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,736
I don't want to talk about so I'm going to not use that freezing anymore

34
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,808

We talked about

38
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,512
The future of insurance and also kind of

39
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,560
What's next for the Smart Home

40
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840
On the insurance

41
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
It's going to be good

42
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
Hey

43
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,704
Just a quick break to talk about Ayla Networks

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,032
Which provides the industry's first agile iot platform

45
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
Accelerating development support and ongoing enhancements

46
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
The connected products for The Internet of Things

47
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,576

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
Cloud a nap environment

52
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,424
And now back to the show

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,472
So let's kick it off with

54
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,776
The end of ice

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
You told me about this

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,944
Doing a web search for the letter i v

57
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:32,320
With what are you talkin about I completely forgot because I used to review of the products from

58
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
I-5

59
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
Spell e y e

60
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
Either like

61
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,768
SD cards with whip-like Wi-Fi radios in them

62
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,864
And you would use those to get your photos from a non connector camera

63
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
2

64
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
Some other device

65
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,496
Take the card out just pop it in another computer

66
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,312
Gets rid of the whole sneakernet thing every was literally just

67
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
Wireless a transfer tank

68
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
But

69
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
Obviously

70
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,712
The rise of smartphones and other connected devices

71
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,760
Obviated the need for a lot of

72
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,576
Yes I V came out man like in 2000

73
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
R2000

74
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
6ish

75
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:15,840
Sixth sense about right and

76
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
In time 2

77
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
An era where

78
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,984
People actually had those little point and shoot cameras

79
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
Which you know I had one and

80
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,616
It was it was a little frustrated he would you take a picture and then you'd be like

81
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
I have a digital picture and if you wanted to you

82
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,736
Method usually with a USB cord and some

83
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
Proprietary software

84
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,088
And then you can get it on your computer and then you could do things

85
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Things with it but

86
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
Sci-fi was

87
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,928
Pretty awesome and then it made it

88
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Easier

89
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
You just shared it

90
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,072
It didn't always work I had really iffy experiences with

91
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
Will a little because it work

92
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
Two different ways and

93
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,520
We said it beginning II the end of I-5 one of the ways sort of will still work

94
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,056
We'll talk about that in a minute

95
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,128
Maine weather in people used it was to

96
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
Abbott photos

97
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,200
Send automatically to an

98
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,992
Through a Wi-Fi network

99
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
They were round

100
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,112
After the cloud and then will be synced on whatever devices you wanted set up everything

101
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,416
It seems to me as I read the

102
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,232
Rachel on I-5 site that after September 6th

103
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
Battle Cloud it is

104
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,559
Pretty much defunct

105
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
Because you can't sign up for new

106
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
Accounts

107
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
September 16th

108
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,007
There's another piece of it which I think they called director mode

109
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,103
Which would set up an ad hoc network so you could just wirelessly transfer

110
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
Turn off all devices

111
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
Hunt's photo

112
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
Set DSLR

113
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
Have the card in it

114
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
So that is

115
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,367
Theoretically still working and it should still work because that doesn't have any do with the cloud

116
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,463
But there's no guarantee it will work so bi people say after September

117
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,279
It so people are really upset because

118
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:54,143
Basically sent out an email last week saying that they were going to

119
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,471
Shut that aspect of the service down basically all the clouds stuff

120
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
And people

121
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
They had

122
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,103
Stocks development of these cards

123
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,967
In 2012 but they were sold through authorized retailers

124
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,271
Through March 2015

125
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:15,135
So people were like hey this is like a little over a year that I've had this if they just bought one

126
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,207
And then apparently unauthorized retailers

127
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,303
Still selling them so like you know if you go on Amazon sometimes you can buy something

128
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
That isn't available anymore

129
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,399
Those people may have bought it you know

130
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
Who knows when they would have bought it

131
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,543
And those people are really upset because they purchase something that

132
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,103
You know maybe they didn't even get a Year's worth of life out of

133
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:41,247
Right and not all of the products are actually being discontinued or unsupported after the 16th of September

134
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
And I say that because

135
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
The X2 cars that are ghosts

136
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,879
Specifically mentioned herein those of the older ones

137
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,719
And they are they being eyesight they are giving

138
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,791
People the ability to upgrade you there movie Pro 6

139
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
Citicards

140
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,887
After three units at a 20% discount

141
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,679
And you have to do that before September

142
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
15

143
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,263
So they still have something

144
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:08,895
Going to happen are in fact I'm looking at the website now the movie promo cards if you buy them now

145
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,223
You get one year of the ice iCloud service so it's literally just

146
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
1

147
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
Product line that is

148
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,319
Being discontinued here with cloud service

149
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,111
And there is probably their largest

150
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
Ryan Reynolds

151
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,975
They say this is a security issue

152
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,279
And this brings up a couple things so

153
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,839
I'm sure going to hear that it is like the second revolve

154
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
I think it's worth thinking about

155
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,447
What it means when you buy a connected device

156
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,567
How long-term the support is going to be in for the manufacturers

157
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
Do they need to put

158
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,479
Closer watch on their retail channels authorized retail channels

159
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,807
What kind of plan for if you're going to obsolete something

160
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,415
Maybe you shorten your window and then you go after

161
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,719
Are authorized retailers more aggressively

162
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,303
There's kind of pros and cons to that because you know sometimes

163
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,375
Things aren't so through authorized retailers

164
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,703
Jennifer variety of reasons maybe it's refurbished

165
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,007
We'll get to that later that could be bad

166
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,895
Mechanism of controlling your channel which sometimes is it the best for the end consumer

167
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,991
That's where I was going by the inventory Channel

168
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,063
So it's one thing for a manufacturer or a product

169
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,367
Designer to know that at some point we

170
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,927
Romance obsoletus or whatever but

171
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,999
Do they plan for that inventory probably not if people can still buy them

172
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
Chances are they going to keep making them

173
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,143
I mean they're going to sell what they have

174
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,471
Also consumers don't we don't know

175
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,287
We don't know what's going on behind the scenes what the plans are so it's

176
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
It's really frustrating

177
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,407
I guess we'll skip ahead a little bit

178
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,735
Because this ties into

179
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
The Arlo

180
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
Camera from Netgear

181
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,879
So I've been testing this out and we'll talk about in a minute but

182
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,719
It was two weeks ago I want to say it was recently the subject

183
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
Security

00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,071
Thread on Reddit

185
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:08,959
And a tissue was that somebody had bought an Arlo camera decided they didn't like it and returned it

186
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
A couple weeks

187
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,519
Slater they log

188
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,407
Vacation on the go

189
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Motion

190
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
The camera that they

191
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
Return to the vendor that they bought it from

192
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
I got an email about it

193
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
Correct

194
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,391
This person was like well that's terrible that I can see this family

195
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
Quit

196
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
Purchased

197
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
His discarded cameras

198
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:37,631
So daycares response was like we're aware of this which is why we tell our sellers to actually send

199
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
The devices back to

200
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
Netgear

201
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
For hard reset

202
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Which wasn't

203
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
So

204
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
That makes me feel like

205
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Okay

206
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
Are the retailers

207
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,455
So are your authorized retailers going to be your friend

208
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,015
Your phone and are you going to treat them

209
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
If they're going to be such an important Link in the chain here

210
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,415
It's got to rethink the relationship between

211
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,511
The consumer and retailers and the manufacturers and their authorized retailer

212
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:11,167
I see both sides of this one for one thing we should mention we can already be personal return the cameras

213
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,495
He didn't like reset them or do anything he said he forgot to reset the

214
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,031
So

215
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
There's some burden on the can

216
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
Consumer to think ahead

217
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:24,223
Which une iot device if you're no longer going to use it or going to retire it you should be trying to

218
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,271
Factory reset it if it all possible

219
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
He did not do that

220
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
What's your

221
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
Yeah we got a level of trust

222
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,951
Third-party vendors worthies middle

223
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
Where people that you know sell products

224
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:41,631
I don't know what Memories Are

225
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
Can you tell I did it for 15 years a long time ago

226
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,567
Middleman in this transaction didn't do their job but the fact of the matter is

227
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:54,687
Retailers don't make money doing things like that retailers make money by selling products

228
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
So what's the incentive

229
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
For that retailer to

230
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
Send it back to Netgear or trying

231
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,135
Mulefactory set himself to sell as a refurbished unit

232
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
They're does in

233
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,559
With connectivity we actually have a really good way of going about doing this

234
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
So

235
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
I will say

236
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,655
It's possible to know

237
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,239
When connected device changes networks Wi-Fi networks for example

238
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
It could be very easy

239
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
4

240
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Maybe not very easy

241
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,407
When a new device connects to a new network

242
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
Ask the person

243
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,527
Are you XYZ the last known person on this account

244
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,391
It's very similar to how if you log onto like a web services account from a different

245
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Computer

246
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Sometimes they will

247
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,279
Be like you'll either get an email or some sort of notifications

248
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
By the way

249
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
You just like

250
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
Completely new device

251
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Is issue

252
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:50,751
Or the web service will say I am not logged in here on this computer you know please enter this

253
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
Password or whatever

254
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,335
And there's another level of authorization

255
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
Exactly so if

256
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407
Something like that

257
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,479
Is doable that could be a way around something

258
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
The other thing is

259
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,855
As someone who tests a lot of these devices

260
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,927
Create counts download stuff

261
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,767
Put things on my network and then I send them back

262
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,631
So I will say that I always

263
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
Look for a way

264
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
To delete the device

265
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,007
Where do a hard reset on my devices

266
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
I will say though

267
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,847
Did not every product offers that

268
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,431
That is also true and every product should any that should be

269
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,015
A given for these types of devices

270
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
Sometime before you know

271
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,903
Alpha Testing and sending it out for beta you need to have

272
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
A way to

273
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,999
At a minimum delete the device

274
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
Count in the software

275
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
So I guess we're asking for three things here

276
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:52,959
Hard reset button on the device awaited to delete the device from your account

277
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
In the app

278
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
And then

279
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
3

280
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Is

281
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,639
Do you want to get extra fancy create an extra layer security by noting

282
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
When a device change

283
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,015
What other got here I want to let Netgear off the hook here

284
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,575
And here's why I'm saying this and you can tell me what you think

285
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,135
The fact of the matter is this guy rich

286
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
Camera okay

287
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,719
When he got the email notification

288
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,023
That says hey your camera just detected motion

289
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,095
Obviously the camera is connected somebody else's house

290
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
They have their own cow

291
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
What is tied to that camera

292
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
And yet

293
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
His

294
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
Account is also tied to that cat

295
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
That should never happen

296
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
That is true

297
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
It should be a one-to-one

298
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,687
Your user to device

299
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
Argue

300
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
Like right now

301
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
Cuz I shared my Arlo camera

302
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
I was with you so you could see what

303
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
What it's about

304
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
Which I forgot to look

305
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,839
Satanic big party for Fourth of July I missed it cuz I was packing

306
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
It's not even Skyping it

307
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
I'd be watching

308
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,983
The camera

309
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
Saints score

310
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,847
Shooting off fireworks and drinking while I'm sitting here packing up

311
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
U-Haul

312
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
I can see why you

313
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,943
Sorry

314
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Your

315
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
Did you have to create a separate account

316
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
Want to get access to it

317
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,903
Yes I do it's easy to accept this invitation I'm reading the email that

318
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
When you invited me

319
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
I got

320
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,815
Advantage of create your own Arlo netgear.com account

321
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
So there you go

322
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,423
So it is time multiple accounts

323
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
To a device

324
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
A better way

325
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Sorry

326
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
Okay I was like cuz that's that's a

327
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
Semi legit reason to

328
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,919
Do it is if you wanted to invite

329
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
You know

330
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,527
Maybe it's something in the baby's room and you want invite the grandparents to see it

331
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,159
Oh you're right you're right I mean I don't know what if there's a better way

332
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
When it's more secure and sell them

333
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,767
I don't know what just seems like these two accounts

334
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,839
Obviously these folks are not on purpose sharing their

335
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
Camera with him

336
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,423
Is account is just still attached to it

337
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,751
Give me some division there between

338
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
An account that has access to the camera

339
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,407
Because if their camera and an account that is shared

340
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Or temporary

341
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,503
Like maybe instruction like I would imagine

342
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,575
If you didn't want me seeing your roof top camper anymore you could shut me off

343
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
I can I can

344
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
I wonder if these people can

345
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
That is another good question

346
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,375
When you buy a new connected device

347
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,727
Are there things that you should look for as a user to see

348
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,359
If it's been bought and sold or if there's other accounts attached to it I imagine there's not

349
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,687
Wrote there a lot of these devices that use

350
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,271
Tape to close the boxes and some of them you can tell if it's been opened

351
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
I suppose you can reseal that particular tape a lot of things have

352
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,647
Ink printer tape it says you know

353
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:56,511
710 Freeway

354
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,327
I remember unpacking these things and I was like

355
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,887
Holy cow how am I ever going to get this back

356
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Together to send it back

357
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
But

358
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Sia Magic

359
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Sorry

360
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,615
Flashbacks to that cuz I was actually a huge deal

361
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
This is just so arduous

362
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Okay

363
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
That's probably enough of that

364
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,063
We'll talk about the Arlo cameras next show

365
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,903
Because I've actually got some other cameras we can do like a all cameras all the time

366
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,207
Let's skip to the

367
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,767
Nest connected crib for a moment

368
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
Because

369
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,375
Dang I got this is pretty cool this is Rico found a patent

370
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,703
So we have no idea if Nest is actually working on this or not

371
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
But it is a connected crib

372
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
It has

373
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,359
Cameras microphones

374
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
Sensors in

375
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Matricide

376
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
I mean it

377
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
Wi-Fi

378
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
Thermostat

379
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,319
No no that's what they're known for

380
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
A way to quiet

381
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
That would be

382
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Worth it

383
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
So worth it

384
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
So I will say

385
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,327
Parenting is one of those

386
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,399
Markets in the iot that feels just

387
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,751
Rich because parents new parents will spend

388
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:15,615
Gobs of money on ridiculous stuff and only later when they would like return to sanity they like

389
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
Wait did I just drop

390
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
$1,000 on a

391
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,271
Oh no no no this is a baby shower wish list

392
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,855
You have somebody else by this for you

393
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
I did also

394
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
I bought a crib

395
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,511
I did buy the mattress and then I bought a baby

396
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
Baby monitor

397
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,095
Hey why don't we

398
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,631
Magical system

399
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,727
It makes sense to me though I mean it seems like the next logical step baby monitors

400
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Rate

401
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,055
Cameras microphones Etc

402
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:50,687
I mean if you got sensors in there to track the baby's moving so you can tell if a baby is asleep without having to go in there

403
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,991
Yeah I guess you can tell from the cameras well unless

404
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
I can't see the baby's face

405
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,575
I think a lot of value

406
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:02,719
And there are mattresses that like will detect SIDS for you so sudden infant death syndrome

407
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,423
Some of them are sensors that are underneath the mattress some of them are mattresses themselves and there's also a whole generation of companies like

408
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
Owlet and sproutling in

409
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
I know that

410
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,799
Offer some sort of wearables

411
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:21,919
But you either attached to the baby's clothing or you put a sock on them or like a little bracelet around their foot

412
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,503
This is a rich Market

413
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
Because people will pay anything

414
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,831
There's a lot of information

415
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,415
I love the idea of having like you can track your baby's weight

416
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
Very well through like

417
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Just putting

418
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,767
A sensor inside the mattress

419
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,327
I think why things

420
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
Biggest why things has a

421
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
Baby scale

422
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,959
Just a straight-up connecta baby scale so

423
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,495
There's a lot that could be done

424
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:52,639
I wonder if they could even add that I don't think it's listed in the patent but but patent application

425
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431
Yak to tell the actual

426
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,991
Skin temperature of the baby and then timeout true

427
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,551
Just so happens if they make a thermos hepatitis

428
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,623
App to view the baby down radhey

429
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
As needed

430
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
After 30 minutes

431
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,399
I will say though baby cribs

432
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,727
Are one of those things where you're not supposed to resell them

433
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,799
Cases because there's a baby cribs are subject to

434
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
Crazy numbers of recalls

435
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
A lot of people

436
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,199
You know baby crib is not a device that

437
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,991
It's like a generational thing like

438
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
Literally my daughter slept in my old

439
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
Very not safe baby crib

440
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,671
That was at my parents house you no one would go visit and

441
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
Please do not

442
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,743
And the CPS

443
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,583
With a connected Crib in like the life cycles were seeing

444
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
This is something that

445
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,167
Time is it going to be recyclable or

446
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,495
What because this isn't something I feel like you could have for like

447
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,055
25 years and keep it in your attic waiting for grandchild

448
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,359
No it's not it's all integrated in

449
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,895
Benefits add-ons to

450
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:01,503
In frame or something in the mattress that's one thing but it's integrated in no I mean it's like saying

451
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,855
Smartphone that I bought this year is going to be my smartphone in 25 years obviously this topic

452
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,207
Yes lot of skepticism here about

453
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
If this is a product

454
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
What am I look like

455
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,607
I will say I talked to a parent and she was like oh that's awesome I can't wait

456
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,447
Possible disc

457
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,727
And

458
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:27,871
What else do we have let's talk about wink last week we spent a lot of time on wink with the relay switch

459
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,431
Which was the connected Wi-Fi light switch

460
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,479
Titan deer week system

461
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,015
Show you all kinds of cool stuff

462
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,879
We said that it was $149 for two and $99 for

463
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
Reply

464
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
Come to find out later

465
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,511
The wink had actually done it as a promotional price in

466
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,047
I was not aware of this

467
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,631
So after we launched the podcast we got a bunch of questions for

468
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,447
4 people say hundred $49

469
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,239
So I reached out to wink and they said

470
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,079
Yes it was initially a promo but we decided to make that the standard

471
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
MSRP

472
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
If you bought it from

473
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
Seriously tell him I said

474
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
And a lot of you guys seen

475
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
Really interested in this product

476
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,023
Your feedback

477
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,375
Yeah I was actually disappointed when people started coming back saying I can't get the deal

478
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,423
I actually was online I was able to get the deal

479
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,239
Whatever I didn't buy it

480
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,103
Rack up the credit card so

481
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,407
I'm thrilled that it's to Toronto

482
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
Yes

483
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
So there we go

484
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,991
Russian out

485
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
If you are so inclined

486
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,319
Alright final news of note

487
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Is

488
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,623
We got to talk about this

489
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,439
That's cuz I'm a sucker for wireless network

490
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,559
Capital keep me from going to.

491
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,887
All right this isn't this is important

492
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,423
Laura

493
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
Which I think we talked about

494
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:02,591
Daniel Conrad the CEO of beat Network switches alluring at work to talk about the standard

495
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
Long distance

496
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
Lowe's

497
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
Network

498
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,223
For The Internet of Things

499
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,063
Competitors would include sigfox which is doing kind of proprietary

500
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
Same thing

501
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:18,976
Some of the LTE cat 0 lte-m are all efforts to kind of take LTE

502
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
And create these

503
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,280
Low data rate Network

504
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
And then there's

505
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,864
Ingenue and

506
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,680
I want to say there's a couple others running around out there

507
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,472
I don't know what happened with weightless

508
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,336
Miley Cyrus older 3-g Networks

509
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
Apparently

510
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,408
There's more efficiencies and redoing it

511
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,016
There are and you know 3geez going to Sunset eventually

512
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
Not anytime soon 2G is being sunsetted right now

513
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
And that's after 115 years

514
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,208
At least

515
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
If not more

516
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:57,632
This is cheaper there's battery life considerations like 3-g is not the most power-efficient mode

517
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
There's

518
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
The cost of the modem itself

519
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
So it is

520
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:06,080
They're also redesigning for like cellular there we deciding things like

521
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,896
The number of packets that are the header soda

522
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,480
Creepy smaller payloads basically to send over the network

523
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
So there's a lot happening

524
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Sometimes it's

525
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
It's better to start

526
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
Dr. Laura

527
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,696
Because a couple big news announcement

528
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
Have happened

529
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,768
There's a company in the US called Senate

530
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,560
S e n e t

531
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,120
That has built a network

532
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,680
810 US cities

533
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,728
Before you get too excited

534
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,128
I know that these are very small cities and there's only covers about is it's less than 10% of the population

535
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
But

536
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:46,016
It's really a great start their other companies were trying to build Laura networks in the US so

537
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Ghetto

538
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,112
We could see our smoke detectors and

539
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:54,720
Trying to think of other things that you might want at the sensors like parking sensors

540
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,816
I was just going to say all the Smart City type devices

541
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,144
Exactly and smart cities

542
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,424
SK Telecom

543
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,216
Is doing a

544
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,800
First I believe Nationwide Lora Network and they're doing it in

545
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
South Korea

546
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
And

547
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
They actually put out pricing

548
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Looks pretty good

549
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,760
Interstate at one-tenth the pricing of their LTE based out of

550
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
Offering switch

551
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:24,416
No baby gets into creating something new from scratch their able to do so more efficiently but

552
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,464
Es6 different plans for

553
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,024
Companies were cities that want to use their

554
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
Lora Network

555
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,328
Ranging from

556
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,912
Well the data allowances I should mention

557
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,704
Range from 100

558
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,984
Killing bites

559
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,288
Two 100gb switch

560
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,616
Why are you the cell phone you like nothing

561
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,920
Of course these devices really only Center

562
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:50,528
Fixing bleep something of information here and there hopefully depending on the device you know

563
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
A water meter doesn't need it

564
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,112
Sending outside gig of data every month

565
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
No it's not.

566
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,952
It's this time and I'm

567
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
Open

568
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
Enclosed

569
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,120
Exactly exactly not

570
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,912
Continuous streams of data

571
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,216
Where we would use for them for streaming video

572
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,008
One example but

573
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:16,640
I'm sipping a pricing standpoint that 100 kilobytes will cost 350 Korean Won

574
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
A month

575
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,688
Which is a whopping

576
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,968
$0.30 us

577
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,504
And then if you want

578
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,320
Any plan of 100 megabytes for your devices

579
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,624
It will cost you 2000 Korean Won

580
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,416
What is all the dollar 70

581
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
Now 2

582
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
What's crazy is

583
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,048
If you take the

584
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
$0.30

585
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,400
Her hundred kilobyte plan you translate that to megabytes

586
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
You had a twin

587
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,312
It was 30 was at $30 for

588
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,616
That was for a hundred megabytes

589
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,176
$0.30 so

590
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Yeah

591
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
Wow it's adds up quick

592
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
So if you're going to

593
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
Consume many megabytes

594
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
Which

595
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
And again this is what the carriers do with leftover cell

596
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,512
More BiggerPockets cheaper on a

597
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,584
Megabyte or kilobyte

598
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,888
And hope that people don't use as much as

599
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
I think

600
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,824
Haven't had a Colonel Sanders

601
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
Chicken bucket in quite a while I've seen

602
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
Five different Colonel Sanders in the past too much

603
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
What's up

604
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
Kept like I'm scarred for life

605
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
This is this is pretty cool

606
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,624
So and then there's also in Scotland

607
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,160
The University of Glasgow

608
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,184
Glasgow

609
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
Class Portland

610
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,024
Guess I'm not going to

611
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,048
Because it would just be a bear

612
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,400
Network in Glasgow

613
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
Dora is really

614
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,984
Taken off

615
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,312
Sigfox which is a French company

616
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
Was

617
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,408
We heard a lot about that about a year-and-a-half ago

618
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
And

619
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,504
I'll be curious to see how well you know

620
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
Laura versus sigfox

621
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
How to play this out

622
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,856
I mean there's no one that says we have to

623
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
At 1

624
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,952
But it is nice if you're buying a sensor in

625
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
You know

626
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:11,328
These are tiny tiny little devices they're not going to support multiple radio standards on

627
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,864
One of these devices

628
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,496
So if you don't have the flexibility might have a tablet or phone we've got room put in

629
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,544
Modems larger modems in different video

630
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,592
Antennas for frequencies

631
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,896
So I should that's a really good point maybe we do need me

632
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,504
Maybe we'll get just one I imagine I mean if I was denied once

633
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
Competition

634
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Ashley between

635
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,088
Linode ideas going

636
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,904
Between a a sick fox versus a

637
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
Laura at work

638
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,000
Appeal to me

639
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,304
For Smart City you really wanted to be

640
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
You don't have

641
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,632
One radio that works with

642
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
You're in

643
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,960
Austin and then a different radio that works

644
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
Dallas

645
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
On your car

646
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,616
You know what they're going to do is they're going to

647
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:00,736
There's going to be a whole market for hubs that go on telephone poles that take blue signals in

648
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
Jamar hubs

649
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
I was like an hour back at the beginning

650
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,160
Alright so now that we've come full circle

651
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
Please

652
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,976
Stay tuned for our guests Ryan rice

653
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Who is

654
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,536
At American Family Insurance

655
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,096
And we were talking about the future of insurance

656
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,376
The future of risk

657
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
And

658
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,008
What technologies ensures might bring into your smartphone

659
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,848
Hey this is Stacy I breaking into the iot podcast for a sponsor

660
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,944
Search I back with Todd Alka who is the CTO of wolf

661
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
SSL

662
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,808
Hardware acceleration for securing the internet

663
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,112
You guys have invested a lot

664
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,160
In building software thick

665
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,208
Can take advantage of co-processors

666
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
Various devices

667
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
Why is that so important

668
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,608
It's really important for our users and makers of devices

669
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,424
Because it increases the security level

670
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,728
Safety for the users as well

671
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
The cost

672
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,336
Because I don't have extra memory and fast

673
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
Processor

674
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,176
Consumer Buttowski because there's less

675
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
Power consumption

676
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,992
So the long run Macy

677
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:11,392
Cheaper priced operate the device it's also huge huge increase in performance

678
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:16,256
Consumer perspective what does it have to do with security

679
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:21,888
The Securities are we done in Hardware so there is less chance for attack

680
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,936
And you can create your safety

681
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:28,032
It's that sounds a little obscure in the home i a t Market you not think of that

682
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,848
Pick up printer attack with someone issues

683
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,640
100000 jobs in a row

684
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:36,480
Duty cycle the printer

685
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:43,136
As a consumer do I have much say or influence in helping make devices more secure

686
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,184
Consumers can have a say is

687
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,000
By picking and find bison Sprite that have

688
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,816
Locations in this case

689
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,096
CM Security

690
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:57,984
It's highly important to many many users and probably most of your listeners so no one wants to broadcast their

691
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,080
Iot devices in vacation mode weather on vacation right or

692
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
Stone monster

Public

695
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,456
So if I'm a manufacturer who cares about

696
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
My customers

697
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,760
Why should I

698
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
Better security

699
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,856
Good security helps

700
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:18,976
Shimmer with the privacy and risk for the Builder

701
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,256
Resume curso

702
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
Win-win

703
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
So you guys helped implement

704
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
All of this

705
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,704
Iot devices

706
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,032
Where can people find you if they want to call you

707
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
For more information

708
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:39,200
Easiest way to reach this is Cam coyote

709
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:45,600
Hey everybody Welcome Back To The Internet of Things

710
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:52,000
Things podcast Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Ryan reist who is the director of it

711
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,560
Innovation at American Family Insurance

712
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,912
ICC doing great thanks for having me on the show

713
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:05,056
I am super excited because I think the insurance world has a huge role to play in adoption of the smartphone

714
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
So

715
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,360
This is going to be fine

716
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
Let's get started with

717
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,456
You guys have been super innovative

718
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,528
Y'all done some Partnerships with ring the door

719
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,600
Connect the doorbell company Deltona partnership with Nest protect

720
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
And I have subsidized

721
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,696
The cost of the devices in some cases

722
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,488
And you also offer discount for

723
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,280
Companies who are installing

724
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
So

725
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,352
What is your take on the Smart Home

726
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
At Anthem

727
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:34,752
That's why I'd agree with you I think insurance companies have a really unique role to play here I think

728
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,776
You know

729
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
American Family Insurance

730
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
Have been

731
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:45,248
Trying to sort of talk about insurance differently as protecting people's dreams as you know elevated Insurance out of this

732
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
Product

733
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,832
Don't really want to use don't know what it is

734
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,392
I'm skeptical about it I don't

735
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,184
Interact with it much and

736
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,720
I think the Smart Home

737
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
MS

738
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:59,584
Huge opportunity for an industry that is going to change a lot

739
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
In the next I think 10 years

740
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:08,288
Okay well let's breakdown kind of the role of insurance going forward because you're right you guys are thinking about it

741
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,104
When I talk to you guys

742
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,640
You're telling me things like

743
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:17,248
Usually I have to call my insurance company

744
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,880
You guys are thinking about making Insurance part of my

745
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,672
More helpful so

746
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
Can you kind of

747
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,512
Break that down and talk about some of the stuff that you guys have

748
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,864
Sure so we talked about it this phrase proactive

749
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
Protection

750
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,192
And I think the opposite of that is reactive reimbursed

751
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,288
Which is really what insurance has been for a long long time and if you don't Insurance places

752
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
Fundamental role in

753
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,384
The economy how many people would own a home if you couldn't get

754
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Insurance

755
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
To help

756
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,224
With Banquo

757
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,296
Insurance places big rollomatic a little bit of micro-level just

758
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
Consumers don't

759
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,856
TV everyday value so

760
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,904
I think that's a huge opportunity I think

761
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,024
Today the last year year before I think insurance companies interest was really piqued by the idea of

762
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,304
Loss mitigation

763
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
So a home that has

764
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
Leak Detectors

765
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,936
Is going to identify and detect a lie

766
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:12,288
And hopefully homeowner will prevent it before it causes massive damage

767
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,824
Fires we know that funk

768
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
Smoke alarm

769
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,384
Prevent fires

770
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:21,248
So I think the original sort of interest is round loss mitigation I think that's definitely

771
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,528
Thought an angle

772
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:26,112
I think the long-term angle that the better approach is

773
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
Product services

774
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416
Beatrice duchess

775
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,720
Help customers solve problems and all

776
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
Okay so

777
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:37,376
What would that look like so let's let's fast-forward three years I've got a bunch of stuff in my home

778
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,168
How would I start to interact

779
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:39,936
With my insurance

780
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,288
Church so I think it starts with that sort of same digital

781
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
Mobile

782
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,104
Experience that you might

783
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
Used for

784
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:52,480
How can I get home products today so I think that could be part of your insurance

785
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,504
Experience I think

786
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,832
And iot triggered event like a leak detector

787
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
Instead of just notifying you on your home

788
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,184
There might actually be serviced

789
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,488
Maybe send somebody else to help you

790
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,280
Check the water offered to help

791
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,816
If you start the process of

792
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
Cleaning up

793
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,168
I think there could be Services that's one example today what we're doing was Ness

794
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Is where

795
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,728
When your batteries

796
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
Diplo

797
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,568
If you're part of our program American Family automatic

798
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,848
We send you replace the battery

799
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,688
Call batteries last long time but that's a cool sort of

800
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,016
Think that insurance companies never used to do in the history of insurance

801
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,600
You get this data and it's really important to talk about your nest program

802
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,904
People at first or like what's happening

803
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,208
Where's if my insurance company seeing all my data

804
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,744
That's a little scary so

805
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
Which nest

806
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,376
You don't actually see the data and asked shares the information about

807
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:49,568
Battery life different programs with Masters the works with Nest there's the safety Rewards program is Xavier

808
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,592
Doors program was

809
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,872
Design for

810
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,712
Insurance industry and we make it very clear when you enroll

811
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,784
We ask customers if they're willing to share their data with us

812
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
So

813
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
There's a clear opt-in there's

814
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
No way to opt out

815
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
And so we are getting battery health data

816
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,464
Top of the people that have

817
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,000
But if I opted into that

818
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
Weekend in triggering event

819
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:15,168
Based on low battery so that's an example of a service that I think is really the tip of the iceberg for how weekend

820
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
Get to

821
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,520
Adjust notifications popping up

822
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,568
So is part of the nest program

823
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:28,736
The people who opt-in get subsidized Nest protect and they also get a discount on their insurance

824
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,272
What's in it for them other than

825
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,392
So they get a discounted product so if

826
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,976
Nest it's a free Nest protect right now their work or running in

827
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
And state of Minnesota

828
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,584
And in addition to get 5% off of there

829
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,608
Homeowners policy

830
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,168
So there's definitely monitoring to a customer

831
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,472
But when we talk about it's your cousin

832
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,008
Today's hits about

833
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
Helping

834
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,824
People say this. Practice protects

835
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,848
We don't know yet

836
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
The relationship between

837
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,432
DIY Smart Home

838
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
Connected home

839
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
And insurance

840
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,784
Now we have 85 years of History

841
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,064
All the bad things

842
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
Can possibly go wrong

843
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
When you're home

844
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,160
And cause damage and injury

845
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
So

846
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,720
We're trying to figure out what is the relation

847
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,792
Shep and can we prevent some of those bad things from happening

848
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,096
What are the next so you got the nest

849
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,632
You got a program with ring

850
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
What else are you looking at

851
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
Do you know

852
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:26,848
Traditional Going Back 2 years I think there's a few insurance companies looking at the typical losses in the home so fire

853
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,896
Are water and staffed and that sort of order

854
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,432
Are the perils

855
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,456
Apparel

856
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,528
60% of the losses are really wind and hail

857
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,832
Stuff that happens to your roof and siding the other 40

858
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
Percent of stuff inside the home

859
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,904
So can we

860
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
Create a marriage

861
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,744
Connected home or we can actually help prevent these

862
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280
Carol's are happening inside

863
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
The water is

864
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
It was a really

865
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,352
Space that we're looking at

866
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,936
Surprisingly there isn't a ton of really gray water detection

867
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,984
Solutions out there there's a lot of sort of low cost

868
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,008
Contact sensors

869
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,800
You can put around this connect to a hub

870
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,104
But I think that's an area that we're seeing some

871
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,896
Innovation and receipt companies

872
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
Start to do more

873
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,456
It also kind of brings up to

874
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,504
Point of retrofit which is

875
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,040
This isn't like cars

876
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,320
Where everybody's going to have

877
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
A new car in 10 years

878
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,672
How do you retrofit a home how do you put

879
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,232
How do you encourage customers to let you in their homes

880
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,792
Stick a water shutoff valve requires a plumber

881
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
That's a pretty big ass

882
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
Sprite

883
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,192
So I think something I've heard you talk about is Smart Homes going to take awhile to get there

884
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,008
Because we're all living in homes that are going to be ready

885
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,104
It's true this is this is something that makes me so sad

886
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:35,712
As I rip and replace all kinds of stuff in my home is actually it was built in 2013 and

887
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
Justin

888
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
Justin 3 years

889
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,880
This I would have put this in

890
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
Course I probably wouldn't work

891
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
Working 5c

892
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
I won't worry about that

893
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,000
So what about trust

894
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
Because

895
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,352
This sounds really nice I would actually love to have

896
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
Hero

897
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,656
A notification

898
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,960
Stacy by the way you got to leak

899
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,544
Or we're sensing a lot of water coming into your house somewhere

900
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,872
Here's five plumbers that we cover in your area

901
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,944
Do you want us to start asking for estimates

902
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
I would love you

903
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
Forever

904
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
But

905
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,344
A lot of people look at this and think about things like

906
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:19,744
They're going to start costing me money maybe if I don't fix something or they're going to see data and they're going to be like oh we do

907
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,072
Not one insurer that house it's got like crazy drafts or I have

908
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,144
So how do you kind of address the idea that

909
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,936
You guys are going to get this data

910
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
And

911
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,240
Use it for baby

912
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,776
Differential pricing

913
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
I don't know something punitive

914
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,896
I think that's a very natural

915
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,176
Expected response

916
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,968
Summarize the time because I think

917
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,112
You look at the insurance industry the whole it needs to change I think

918
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,648
Find a different areas where

919
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,184
Call Jessica

920
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
I think

921
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,816
If you understand the business we're in and we're rats today I think it makes more sense so

922
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,864
What's walk down at example of

923
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,936
Aviva insurance company I mean I already today

924
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,984
The insurance is in what we call low engaged

925
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,336
Consumers do not interact with a very often other than paying for a bill

926
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,384
Maybe once every 10 years you have a claim

927
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
What's the fact that we live in an age

928
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,808
Exponential technology growth we live in an age of One Click Amazon

929
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
Shopping

930
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:20,928
And Uber description of experiences the den entrepreneur Ozark rating

931
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,976
That's a recipe for Destruction

932
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:26,560
So I think any insurance company that thinks they're going to use this data to

933
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:31,680
Sophisticate there their pricing model which is already pretty sophisticated and not

934
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,728
Ensure people raise prices

935
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,264
How is that going to impact

936
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,568
Customer experience in any sort of positive way

937
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
They want

938
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,128
And I think that's the recipe

939
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
For failure

940
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
So

941
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,224
I mean we're looking at this really at the long-term and saying

942
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,528
How do we take an industry that

943
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,088
Yo is it love today and how do we make it lost

944
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,136
Because that's really where

945
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
Long-term

946
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
Excessive going to rest

947
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,256
And as we add this kind of data

948
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
How does this change

949
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:02,400
Underwriting practices and kind of what risks because if you can say

950
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,960
You got the sensor in your house that

951
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,520
Can detect a leak before it gets bad

952
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,336
Your reducing a large

953
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,152
Chunk of Rights provided someone takes action

954
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
So

955
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:21,088
Does this mean like eventually overtime my insurance rates could go lower insurance as we know it

956
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,904
Because we know it is going to change so take the car for example

957
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,208
People predicting anywhere between

958
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:30,048
20 and fifty years that there will really won't be personal Auto Insurance

959
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:36,192
Anderson companies either companies are going to make the artificial intelligence that runs the car they're going to pick up the liability insurance

960
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,728
Another example is

961
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,008
Is cyber cyber threat

962
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
Cyber insurance

963
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:44,128
So much of the world is going from physical to digital that a lot of threats or now

964
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,968
Cyberspace so if you're not into cyberspace 20 years from now

965
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,016
Yeah will you be around will you be relevant

966
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:50,784
So I think

967
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,064
Risk is changing

968
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,136
Customer perception of a current industry is not great

969
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,696
And I think the connected home presents this

970
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
Wonderful opportunity

971
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
B2

972
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,536
Be a hero brand you better

973
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:07,168
Farris Motor Company you guys have a team driving program and I think it's actually exemplifies that type of thinking

974
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:11,520
Do you want to talk a little bit about that I'm very passionate about that that was my job for

975
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,592
Well over a year was to travel around Middle America in

976
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
Meet with parents

977
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,408
Continue to try to convince them to put this

978
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,456
Basically a video camera in there

979
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
Cars

980
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,624
And that's sort of the seeds were planted there I think of American families Innovation or rats today so what happened is

981
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,160
There was a video event

982
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:32,256
Recorder that would get placed in the car and it would be triggered off of motion

983
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:38,144
So it's the teen driver did an erratic turn or slammed on the brakes all the things that actually lead to accidents

984
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:42,752
Hayward be a video clip that was sent to the parents so it only recorded you if you did something

985
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,616
And so quickly overtime in a very short period of time

986
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,384
Beetlejuice

987
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,944
Went from like 40% to 100%

988
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
So all the sudden have kids with driving with a seatbelt

989
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,576
The next thing was parents started talk about tailgating

990
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
Stop texting while driving those types

991
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,416
What is program

992
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,440
Doubt it was

993
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:06,048
Economically was it sound no cost for way too high back then but costs are coming down

994
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,328
And

995
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,632
You cannot do the same thing with your phone basic

996
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,936
Zapp's today that you can mount on your dash

997
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,984
Duke primary the same thing

998
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:17,312
And out of that program I saw parents in tears

999
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,408
Saying I will never switch to another insurance company you guys helped save

1000
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
My son or daughter's life

1001
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,504
And that's a really powerful thing when you're in the industry this

1002
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:30,880
Has historically I changed a lot

1003
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,440
Can drive a whole new different type of business

1004
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,000
OKC and I would

1005
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
Question

1006
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,352
Power to you guys protect my child

1007
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,264
To show every time you break rapidly

1008
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,312
My husband would go for it.

1009
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:54,943
Yeah and if you look at where the usage-based insurance industry is gone

1010
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,223
There's very few companies

1011
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,527
Second cousin

1012
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
Sleep analyzer

1013
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,855
Driving bad most of them

1014
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:07,743
I think most insurance companies are hesitant to go in that other direction and to penalize people for

1015
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,559
What to eat Pacific risky Behavior

1016
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,583
I certainly know

1017
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
Are we taking

1018
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,399
Incredible amounts of

1019
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
Carson and

1020
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,215
Effort

1021
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,007
Detroit number one transparent with customers

1022
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,799
If they know what's going on

1023
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,823
Why are using a

1024
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,383
Opt-in for the voluntary

1025
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,175
Answer some benefits of them

1026
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:32,831
I think what we found in are certainly connected home and working the connected cars that's the recipe for

1027
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,111
Mutual Trust

1028
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
And

1029
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
Awesome

1030
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,999
Alright well let's go into the connected home a little bit because

1031
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:46,655
You guys have experimented with I think you told me for every program y'all Implement y'all have tried out 22:30 differ

1032
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,703
Other devices on the back

1033
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,471
Gantz o

1034
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,007
You seen a lot of stuff

1035
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
And

1036
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,055
Where do you think

1037
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
Smart Home

1038
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,919
Yeah I think if we were to sign intelligence

1039
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,455
Score

1040
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,247
People that this is the intelligent home

1041
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,807
I think it's somewhere you know around an IQ of us

1042
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:07,135
Sixty or seventy I think it's you know it's sort of a mentally deficient

1043
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,671
Home it's not a smart

1044
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,207
But that's good because

1045
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,023
Fights in years ago it was a totally unintelligent

1046
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,815
What I'm seeing as

1047
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
Success

1048
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
Companies

1049
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,167
Salisbury specific problems

1050
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,983
Wonderful Whites of the nest

1051
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
Thermostat

1052
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,543
Was way better than the old

1053
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,567
Programmable thermostat

1054
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,407
Sold a very specific problem right then try to create

1055
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
Smart Home

1056
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
The ring video doorbell

1057
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,247
Is about

1058
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,271
Preventing

1059
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
Justin burglaries in neighborhood

1060
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
And everybody has a dork

1061
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
Nobody knows

1062
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:42,207
That the old doorbell did one thing and the ring doorbell does like

1063
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
20 awesome things

1064
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,279
I should interrupt you for a second

1065
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,071
To know that you guys are an investor

1066
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,143
Thank you yes we are an investor with a venture capital

1067
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,447
We have a investment in

1068
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:56,543
But ring is interesting because people get it because they sink

1069
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,335
Did they want they wanted to protect their home

1070
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,895
Outside in a public

1071
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
Space

1072
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,199
Scrapy in any way

1073
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,503
That's something somebody can hack him

1074
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:09,087
See inside your home but when they get it they have all these other benefit

1075
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,623
It's like they see when packages arrive

1076
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903
Macy win

1077
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,231
Your friends come to the home and now you can unlock your door

1078
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,791
From ring administrations that they're building so I think

1079
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,839
Rings for broke through

1080
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,887
By being really really good at

1081
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
Solving cost

1082
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,679
4 problems

1083
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,703
Pacific area

1084
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,543
I think what's going to happen is now with sort of programs like works with nest

1085
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,615
People get these things it solves problems for them

1086
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,687
And I can maybe get another thing in the Abby's building blocks

1087
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:38,527
And then pretty soon things like Amazon Echo come along make

1088
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,807
Easier to work with them

1089
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,599
And I think it's going to take time off

1090
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
Will get there

1091
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:48,255
So let's talk about Amazon Echo because in the last probably I'm going to say 6

1092
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,535
12 months

1093
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:57,727
Everyone's like oh my God I have a smart home I have voice control it's amazing it was it's kind of like

1094
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
Possibly

1095
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,335
What is your oven do you have one what are you guys

1096
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,103
Speak about that

1097
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,151
Yeah I have one eye

1098
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,199
Can I retested Schoology

1099
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:07,967
Devices

1100
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,271
Test of in my home personally

1101
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,295
Oh my pasta

1102
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,623
Big family issues with cameras in the house and

1103
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,415
At the echo is

1104
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
Really interesting

1105
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,487
She follows where the customer adoption

1106
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
All these devices

1107
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,839
It's a lot of the stuff is early adopters will buy anything

1108
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,863
If it's cool

1109
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,399
Engadget e Wright

1110
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:31,519
What happened with the echo is you know it took the interface from the phone and

1111
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,055
At a fatigue

1112
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,591
To the physical world

1113
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
And I don't think anybody would have predicted

1114
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,663
The echo

1115
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,735
And for me you know it's something that my kids use

1116
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,319
In fact we got a rule if you if you play Shut Up and Dance One More Time

1117
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,415
Vehicle goes away and it's something my parents are not giving away to their friends

1118
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:52,255
The problem is connected home is really bridging into that mass market and I think

1119
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,535
Carla Thomas gee

1120
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,327
Are the problem I think is

1121
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,119
Making the devices song

1122
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,215
Customer problems real problems in the second part of it is making it really easy and natural

1123
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,543
I have to ask this because you are an investor

1124
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:12,991
And it was a step back for the industry the shutdown of the revolve Hub in the absolute

1125
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,807
The way it was handled felt really

1126
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
Preemptive

1127
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,111
And now they're giving

1128
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,903
A refund to people who bought it

1129
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,975
Aren't the nest guys are getting a refund of people about it

1130
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:26,303
Beforehand they just for like hey Rita shut this device down

1131
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
And

1132
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:28,863
Thank you

1133
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
So

1134
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,423
How did you feel like

1135
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,239
That was handled or that could have been

1136
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,799
I can't comment on

1137
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,079
Specifics of nest

1138
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,151
Handling of the Revolt shot. Bride you think it shows you

1139
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:45,759
And if you talk to the people at Bolton other places and no Hardware really well

1140
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:50,367
It just shows you how difficult it is to be in the space you know how do you sound setup

1141
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,647
How do you turn something off

1142
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,695
Because it was so publicized

1143
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,231
I think it did

1144
00:46:55,743 --> 00:47:01,887
Do some damage to adoption is a whole cuz people were forced to suddenly realize it there is spending a lot of

1145
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,655
Nice things in

1146
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:06,751
Is something that's owned by such a legit company could suddenly go away like

1147
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,567
It was kind of like

1148
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,639
What am I really willing to invest on all this stuff

1149
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:17,503
Yeah so if you spend $203 on device how long do you expect it to last

1150
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,039
That's a great question

1151
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,087
I think we're learning I think

1152
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,879
Industry still trying to figure that out

1153
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Okay

1154
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,463
Final question for you

1155
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,767
Because you tested so many things

1156
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,303
What are your

1157
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,399
Favorite devices or what are you looking for excited about then

1158
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
Years to come

1159
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,471
Well I'm really

1160
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
Interested in

1161
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,031
Now is

1162
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,567
How these devices

1163
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,615
And how the data from these devices

1164
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,895
Can lead to service

1165
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,967
So I think that opportunity for

1166
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,759
Connected home is not

1167
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,575
Notifications in apps I think it's healthy

1168
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:56,159
The data the real data from The Real World which is busy

1169
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,463
Instrumentation

1170
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,511
How do we use that information

1171
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,583
To create new products and services that

1172
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,119
Never existed before

1173
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,959
We still screen and test a ton of

1174
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,239
Devices ID

1175
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,799
Amazon

1176
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,335
That goes for the Breakthrough

1177
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,359
In the last year

1178
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,943
There's a lot of cool stuff for looking at now and that's where the water shut off side

1179
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
But I think

1180
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,247
Really it's about

1181
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,295
Services I think that's what we're seeing from

1182
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,575
Consumers wants

1183
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,391
Yo bro get a real big aha this last

1184
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,951
Which was it's not really the connected home it's the home

1185
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,743
It might be that may be connected

1186
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:35,583
It's the home and it's homeowners that are living in the home that have real problems

1187
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,119
That they need salt

1188
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,703
Owning a home is one of the most complicated challenging things

1189
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,495
32 speight painting to home

1190
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:46,335
Childish things that you're not doing right now and I'm not doing that we don't even need me

1191
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,615
No need to do

1192
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,407
I change the furnace filter

1193
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,943
Every six months or

1194
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,711
What we started

1195
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,479
Dive into

1196
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,759
Is less of the gas

1197
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,551
Three more of the problems in the home

1198
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:01,183
And how can connected home be apart about holistic solution that includes devices-and-services and insurance

1199
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,463
I can't wait

1200
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,255
I should ask you I lied to you

1201
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
One more question

1202
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:11,423
Am I ever going to have to have like an app for my insurance company for monitoring this or do you guys want to do most of this through

1203
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
Partnerships

1204
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,263
I think you're going to find delightful

1205
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,311
But you have insurance companies do it right with

1206
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,895
You know American Family certainly thinks we're heading that direction you're going to want to

1207
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,687
Use your insurance app

1208
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,759
Mobile app or mobile experience because it's more than just

1209
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,527
What happened

1210
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,807
It might be

1211
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,343
Contextual information about

1212
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,879
The weather it might be

1213
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,159
Information about

1214
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,695
Non iot device

1215
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,743
That you care about the robin

1216
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,047
Oh you could do a partnership with next door

1217
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,863
You could be like hey there's been a rash of burglaries in your area

1218
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,167
There was a company we looked at that was

1219
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:49,567
Layering from connected home to external Transportation so do I want to go get on the

1220
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,615
Bicycle or do I want to take the bus

1221
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:55,455
You're so not just me and my home but as I leave my home and go by lights

1222
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,015
Flight yeah I think actually

1223
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,551
Connected home app

1224
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,623
Is going to be part of something bigger

1225
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
Sing

1226
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,439
In the future now is that insurance

1227
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,719
We certainly hope we're

1228
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:11,583
Have that sort of role in people's lives

1229
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:18,239
Thank you for having me that's it for this week's show please join us next week on the Internet of Things podcast

1230
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:24,639
And thanks for listening
