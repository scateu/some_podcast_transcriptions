Let's talk about the Amazon Echo Show

38
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
Before we do that

39
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,440
How much caffeine have you had today

40
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:13,120
You're singing your dance and I can't see you but I know your Bebop and everywhere

41
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,424
Hear it cuz my chair squeaks so that's that's

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,008
What's happening I'm glad I have not had a lot of

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,312
Surprisingly

44
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
But you do have an Amazon show and I do not

45
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,176
I did see if you had we could be doing this

46
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
On the show

47
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
That's actually

48
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,088
Good reason not to have a show

49
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:39,488
The Amazon Echo Show it came out it was delivered on June 28th to anybody who pre-ordered the

50
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
Device this is a

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,352
Amazon Echo so mad amazed inside

52
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
And

53
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
It is a 7in touch screen

54
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
On this

55
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
Funky bass

56
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,264
Is it is not the most appealing

57
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
Looking design

58
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
Out there

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,128
And we'll talk about a little bit more on that in a second

60
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
It cost $229

61
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
You can get $100

62
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
Offer to buy to go correct

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Yes

64
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
And

65
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,648
That's why I titled the show what I titled it which is the Amazon

66
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
Michelle makes me feel so lonely

67
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
Because it does

68
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,768
Because I have one

69
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,096
And the biggest problem with the Echo Show

70
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
Is that

71
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
It's really freaking hard to call people

72
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,984
It's hard to find your friends

73
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
It's hard like

74
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
I've only got out of all of my contacts

75
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
Tax

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
I think I have 10 people I can

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,576
Another was our people who have a show or who have an echo because I know you and I have had a voice call

78
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
Those are people who

79
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Who have

80
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,464
Actually it's an echo it's the whole Echo interface but I don't mind not being it

81
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Caucus

82
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Could I call you

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
Skype

84
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,864
Google Hangouts

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,424
I sent you a postcard

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
Yes all of these options are available to

87
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,520
But I can't I can't just drop it on you

88
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
So so let's talk about

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
How this work

90
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,920
Show with the Echo Show I can do to differ

91
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,480
If someone else has an

92
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
An Echo Show

93
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
I can

94
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
Call them

95
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
We would essentially have a video call

96
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672
It looks nice it works really well actually

97
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
Or

98
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,280
If we're really good friends are like your parents or something like that

99
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,583
You can actually drop in

100
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
You can

101
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:25,471
Label someone is being okay in your contacts list to drop in and then they can call you

102
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,519
Any point in time in the actually

103
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
They can do this from

104
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
Madam ASAP

105
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
On the phone too

106
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,967
Kevin you could actually if I if I said it was okay

107
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
From Madame ASAP

108
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
Youku

109
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,575
Call me on the show

110
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
We could do a video call Ashley

111
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
To show

112
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,487
That's funny you say that because I was actually in the app as you were described as Mike I bet you I can

113
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,535
Have a video call with the phone and I could

114
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Yes

115
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
Or if I said

116
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
It's okay for

117
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
Kevin

118
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
To drop in on the show

119
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,983
Kevin could actually just use that drop in function

120
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
Pinterest

121
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
What happens then

122
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
Is

123
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
He would

124
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
Actually start seeing

125
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
Right away he would see a blurred version

126
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
Busy typing

127
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,783
Eventually it comes clear and clear

128
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
So this is time for you to put on your shirt if you're dating

129
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,671
Then suddenly would be like

130
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
And

131
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
We can talk video conference hands-free

132
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Gotcha

133
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
Okay

134
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
Tell a couple things

135
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
Amazon

136
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,519
Pics the people in your contacts it ask for permission when you give it permission to look at the people in your

137
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,591
It's going to look for the people in your contacts 12

138
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
Phone number that's registered with

139
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Amazon

140
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,199
If that is the same number registered with the

141
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Echo

142
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,527
Or there a account

143
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
Then you'll see their name

144
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
Gotcha

145
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
So it's like it's your mom

146
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,231
The Amazon account is in your dad's name

147
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
You're going to have to have him

148
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
He'll beer

149
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,375
Pssi telephone number essentially

150
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,447
Yes in the phone number that they registered their Echo devices

151
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
Weather

152
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
Padme stuff

153
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Amazon

154
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
Okay

155
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
So that's

156
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,383
That's one so it's really not easy

157
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
To connect

158
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
It's not as simple as sending out like an email in

159
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,367
And my mom is like to have one of these and she's I can't be just talk on Duo

160
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
I was like okay fine

161
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,183
Hide and then she's like I don't want Google to have

162
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Have my phone number

163
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
No no no I don't want to talk into

164
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,655
So we're going to Skype

165
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
Stacy I don't want to talk to you anymore

166
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Tall

167
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,799
And that's what my mom and I are no longer talking

168
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,847
So some other things about the echo

169
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,175
The show doesn't have the capabilities you want

170
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
I'm just going to say this to be

171
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
Totally real

172
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,575
The potential is really there in like doing things like

173
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,135
You can tie it to some of your video cameras

174
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,207
I wanted to tie it to my August doorbell

175
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,303
But so far that doesn't seem to be working for me I'm not sure why

176
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,119
Cuz I would like to be like hey

177
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
Animated show me my doorbell

178
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
Which cool feature

179
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,287
I'm you can also if it's linked into like

180
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,615
It's temperature sensors inside you can paint show me the indoor temperature

181
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
Edible show you that it

182
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,199
It's nice for features like the weather cuz you can see the

183
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,623
It is also nice for Amazon Prime this is a use case I didn't really think about that my daughter and I were

184
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
It's my show is in the kitchen

185
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,231
The other thing is

186
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
We put

187
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,303
The original Echo

188
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Away from her

189
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,143
The kitchen at used to be in the kitchen and now it's not

190
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
But

191
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,215
The show is not as good

192
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
For two reasons one

193
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
You can't tell

194
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,103
If the screen is not facing you you don't know if it's

195
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,455
There's no light indicator of any kind not on top of it

196
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
In into

197
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,599
I don't want their Mike's all around but when it's not facing me

198
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
It doesn't seem to hear

199
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,207
So it's hearing seems to be a little bit in

200
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Compared to the rake

201
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,095
And this is an exact same position

202
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
The other one was

203
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:10,495
Right I think the original Echo has zika 7 array microphone

204
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,591
Or 7 microphone array I should say I don't know what the

205
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,943
Show house but they are far field mics

206
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
So it was It was kind of surprising to us

207
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
So keep that in mind

208
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
And then

209
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
The scream can be a distraction

210
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,487
Cuz as long as it thinks you're there

211
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,279
It's showing you stuff it shows you

212
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
They're not actually ads

213
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,911
All the time there's like trending topics but they sometimes could be an ad

214
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,239
Also something.

215
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
Consider I like the fact that shows me the weather all the time

216
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
You can use it to show

217
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
Photos if they're stored in your

218
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
Amazon

219
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
Photo account

220
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
Apparently is a thing

221
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,111
Yeah it is an and I believe I got an email

222
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:03,999
Maybe 2 weeks ago that Amazon was getting rid of the lower-tier very inexpensive

223
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,607
Storage for photos and they're going to bump everybody up

224
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
With a higher-priced larger

225
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,727
Tierce I don't know if people are aware that or not but

226
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Yeah

227
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
But you can also put

228
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Some photos

229
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,639
In there in into I think the app to show is like you

230
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
Your home screen

231
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,711
I did that with a photo

232
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,295
It was granted it was a photo that I pulled from WhatsApp

233
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
It did not cover the whole screen

234
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
I don't know if it wasn't high enough resolution cuz I pull

235
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Pull it from WhatsApp

236
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
It is just keep picture

237
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
Vacation

238
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:41,119
But could be but also that that touchscreen is actually I believe a lower resolution than one might think

239
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,191
1024x600 it's not even a 720P

240
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,751
Yeah so like some people I had read their lie

241
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,335
Watching videos on it and like you don't want to watch videos on this really

242
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,895
For any length of time you can watch a movie on it

243
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,967
Maybe a YouTube video with a recipe or something but not

244
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
Something detailed

245
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
And that gets me to recipes

246
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,903
And yesterday I was making

247
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
A really complicated

248
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
Recipe so

249
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,535
I actually pulled up it only pulls recipes for

250
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Allrecipes

251
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
I wish I wish I could pull up the web on the

252
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,519
Now so when I pulled up all recipe skills

253
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
Basically I would

254
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
I was looking for a Cajun spice

255
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Snakes eyes like

256
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Show me recipes for

257
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Cajun spice

258
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
And it pulled up a whole bunch

259
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,575
And I picked one and you can either pick up with your finger

260
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,671
Scroll through and pick up with your finger or you could say choose number 9

261
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
We totally hands-free

262
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
I was like okay show me ingredient

263
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Show me the ingredients

264
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,631
But after about a minute

265
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Outright

266
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
It stopped

267
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
It was like if you want to see

268
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
The steps

269
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
Continue

270
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
And it's a Spaceman

271
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
So I didn't say anything

272
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
Go back

273
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
But I had to do the search again

274
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,367
For the recipes I wanted it to stay longer because

275
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
I wanted to stay until I tell it to go

276
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
Because that's all right

277
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Could be alone

278
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,559
I don't know if there is a setting in

279
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
The app for that

280
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,679
Terms of going back like the home screen or something that's possibility

281
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
I don't know

282
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,519
But I totally agree that wouldn't want that to go away on me

283
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,359
I would think it's got an it's got a camera obviously so I would think if

284
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,663
You're still standing in front of it working your

285
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
You know spice mixing whatever

286
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
It knows

287
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
You're there

288
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
It does

289
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
It's just kind of like

290
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,791
Not to backtrack on the the device actually does have an 8 microphone array

291
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
What

292
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,863
It doesn't sound the top

293
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,423
Under 3 hardware buttons on the top of the

294
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
And it's that

295
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,263
Ring of dots at

296
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,615
Elliptical ring of dots around those three buttons that's where they microphones are

297
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
Exact same space

298
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
My other Echo

299
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
So

300
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
Not good

301
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
It does sound better though

302
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:18,047
I was just going to say it's got two speakers since the first Echo device has two speakers I would suspect

303
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
Bellatrix handled better

304
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
It does

305
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,983
Okay so that I felt like there was one other thing I wanted to go

306
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,823
How do you say I watch videos on it so it's right there at the

307
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,127
How do I get a breakfast bar that we have in the kitchen

308
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,943
My daughter and I were watching

309
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
Amazon

310
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,015
Cuz we're Amazon Prime subscriber

311
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Possibly obviously

312
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:46,207
We were just sitting there a breakfast ghetto paging through videos and and watching trailers for movies to see what

313
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Where can I watch tonight

314
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
Lights out

315
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,535
That was actually kind of a neat

316
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
I don't know if I can

317
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
Check that out why didn't we

318
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
Why didn't we watch our usual

319
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,847
Okay so that's the show I would say

320
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
It is not a need to have device

321
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,479
The coolest thing is probably video calling but there's no one to call

322
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,087
Everything in the first fax machine

323
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
Exactly what I feel

324
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,743
But but but but I remember when the original Echo came out

325
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:25,119
I felt the exact same way there's not enough here to make us I must have it wasn't until

326
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,399
46 months later

327
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,239
That Services became available

328
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Psychic reading things for it

329
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
Then I'm like oh I got to have it

330
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
Now I have four of them so

331
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:42,015
I give it time I think you know I think what you're saying is probably accurate maybe now it's not a must have but how long until it becomes

332
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
True and

333
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:48,415
Like if you have a video camera that works with this thing it would be great for you

334
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,207
Show me what's happening upstairs

335
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
You'll be able to see

336
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
That's the show

337
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Alright

338
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Alibaba

339
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,775
Reportedly planning to challenge Amazon Echo

340
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:10,687
Not much detail here but that's what they're planning according to the Wall Street Journal and the information

341
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
It's at possibly as soon as next

342
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,063
Week which would actually be this week based on when this article was written

343
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
So

344
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
MN

345
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,439
How many people we have in China listening to show but good for them

346
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Is

347
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
I'm assuming that

348
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
Google home is certainly not available in China

349
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:33,215
I'm assuming Amazon echos aren't available in China in either but that's a guess it's going to make an Amazon Echo

350
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
Bike

351
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Anna story

352
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
Man whatever happened to xiaomi

353
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
Remember

354
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
It was coming on strong without weather

355
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,807
It was as me line of Smart Home Products they had all kinds of stuff and

356
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,439
And they were the big thing last year and I don't think it's a yes I saw

357
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,327
I know it will also mention its article is Baidu

358
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Which is a big

359
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:05,215
Rival in China and apparently they launched their own voice controlled home robot

360
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
Call Little Fish

361
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,543
Which is interesting back in April

362
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
Yeah

363
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
I like the name but I

364
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
Is it or is it what it what is

365
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
I don't like it says it includes a tablet screen so you can

366
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,087
Turn searches order food play music and movies

367
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
So

368
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
May 2nd show

369
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Without

370
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,511
Alright also in a personal assistant

371
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
Smorgasbord

372
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
Google home

373
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,375
Is rolling out bluetooth a little earlier than

374
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
Well

375
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:42,847
There's nothing official from Google saying this is rolling out yet however at Google IO back in may they did say Bluetooth stream

376
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
Available on Google home

377
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
And

378
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Because

379
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:53,087
A lot of the Music Services I use are available on my Google home so which one of the reason I didn't buy one

380
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
But if I get Bluetooth streaming

381
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
I can imagine

382
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:02,815
Stream something from my phone to the Google home like any other Bluetooth speakers so that's that's a bonus I think

383
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
Did you can still cast

384
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
Things but it has to have

385
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
The opposite house

386
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
Support for

387
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
Tom Cassell casting

388
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
Yeah and

389
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
This is also something we talked about cuz it was in the Android AP

390
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
BK

391
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Correct

392
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,271
Some people were seeing speakers

393
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,343
They were seeing access to some of their Bluetooth speakers

394
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
It was not an option

395
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,951
What's happening yeah they must have gotten

396
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:36,351
They that firmware update I'm sorry that the software update for the Google home app a little bit early or it's just being rolled out

397
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,935
Gradually my check ready for the show I don't have the update yet so

398
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
I cannot either

399
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
Yasso

400
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,567
Well maybe this week will hear something official

401
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
News is out there

402
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
Wouldn't surprise me if schools

403
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,919
If it got it ready just says yet

404
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
We have two kids coming this week

405
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Eventually go up

406
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
For what it's worth

407
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
All right

408
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Bad news

409
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
Pearl

410
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
I can't believe it in Taipei

411
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
Does last week cuz it did

412
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
My bad

413
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
So Pearl

414
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
Backup Vision Care

415
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
Rear vision camera

416
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,775
This was a company of Engineers from

417
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
Former Apple dictionary

418
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,871
Camera

419
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
And they

420
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
Have decided

421
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
2 shutter door

422
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,855
Yeah then raised about 15 million dollars in VC funding the backup cameras integrated into it like a license plate

423
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
White frame

424
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,415
And I guess

425
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,535
It was a good idea but not a good idea

426
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,679
The ship now we've been a good idea to ship 3 or 4 years ago but they only found themselves in 2014

427
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,263
Selling it for $500

428
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
And

429
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:53,151
Correct me if I'm wrong that you would output the video camera to your connected phone

430
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,735
Yeah so it's not like a building solution which at this point

431
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,551
Most car makers are already integrating an

432
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,855
And why is that Stacy

433
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Because

434
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,183
The National Highway

435
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
Castration says that my

436
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,839
2018 all new cars sold in the US have to have

437
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,423
Instant killer for pearl

438
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:21,311
People's old cars but a lot of people with old cars probably are not spending $500 on

439
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
No I mean

440
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,431
I said this right before the show if this was like

441
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,295
5199 maybe 249 solution

442
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
It wouldn't have some traction but

443
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
Not as $500

444
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,999
Very sad that they actually were there apparently were some offers to act

445
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Acquire them

446
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
An act

447
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
Higher

448
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
Not enough choir

449
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
They didn't want to be

450
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:53,055
We'll probably see some other cool stuff

451
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
So

452
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
That's what you know

453
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:01,247
This is what we're going to see this is going to be the year of a positions in the space especially in the connector

454
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
Kind of consumer Orient

455
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Space

456
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,575
End

457
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Deaths

458
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
There's no other

459
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
All right

460
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,351
Which is a low-power wide area network

461
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,655
Dedicated Networks

462
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
The Internet of Things

463
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
Long long distances

464
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,055
Cheap cheap pricing

465
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,615
So this is ingenue which

466
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Actually

467
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,175
Was formed by some former Telecom

468
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
Some guys

469
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,759
This is John Horn who

470
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
Joined ingenue in 2015

471
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,135
The company actually used to be on

472
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
And Horn used to be the director of

473
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,231
Machine-to-machine services at

474
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Mytmobile

475
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,071
Basically this guy is out

476
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,143
My hunches in this is reporting from fiercewireless by

477
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,959
This is State they figure this out so good on them

478
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:57,311
This is going to we're going to see this happen we're about to see a consolidation in

479
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
The space because I think

480
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
Sigfox ingenue

481
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,479
There's Laura that's in the space now Laura is in a company that's

482
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,831
Smartstandard there's something but he's like Comcast is working with Laura

483
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
Other startups are working with Laura

484
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
What we're going to see here is

485
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,255
Increasing pressure from the cellular guys that are

486
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,607
Creating these nb-iot in LTE cat 1M

487
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
Basically

488
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,447
Cellular guys are creating their own

489
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
And so

490
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:32,895
There's a number of reasons why pregnancy pressure but I think the biggest thing we'll see is a bifurcation between

491
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,455
Cellular networks and then

492
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Things like lore

493
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
That's my hunch so

494
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
Sigfox should be kind of worried

495
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Ingenue

496
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
Also should be worried

497
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,903
So we'll see what happens

498
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:48,255
And related to this I just read this morning that one of the carriers

499
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
Vodafone New Zealand

500
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:54,399
Aveda playing a narrowband or NB iot Network really next year

501
00:20:54,655 --> 00:21:00,287
Crosman Zealand they done some testing already there and do some more testing with some customers later this year but then

502
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
Phone network rollout

503
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
Next year is what they're saying

504
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,943
And you know any of our listeners have this

505
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,295
Of where the stuff is out so in the US Verizon and AT&T are doing MBA.

506
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
Works and they're supposed to be out

507
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
Next year

508
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,391
I kind of been like

509
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,952
Really really are they really coming out

510
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:23,072
Cuz they all started actually pushing the cat one in which are a little bit more band

511
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
Out first but

512
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
I don't see a lot of

513
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
Fat people clamoring to

514
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,824
To use those just yet and I think the pricing still needs to kind of come into

515
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
Come into the picture

516
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
That's a lot of like

517
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
Well we don't know

518
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
But

519
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,504
We're see it the way things are coming

520
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,624
I would agree

521
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Now

522
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Kevin

523
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,048
Yes a rare purchase I haven't bought any iot stuff

524
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
Well took my Google home but

525
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
This was some kind of crazy

526
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,424
But I ended up buying

527
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,264
A Home Security Suite as it's called from gocontrol

528
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
And it contains one

529
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,616
Passive IR motion detector

530
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,920
And two door or window sensors

531
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
Kerstetter magnetic

532
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
And

533
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,040
Most people would buy them for what's in the name security

534
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,088
I didn't buy these for security however

535
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,624
I actually bought these

536
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,464
To have automatic lights go on when you open or close a door

537
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
4

538
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:29,632
A closet for example because of my bedroom closet we have that wink relay just outside of it and actually turned a dumb light in the closet

539
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
Smart light as a result

540
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,240
And every morning around 5:30 a.m. I

541
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:39,360
Kind of hear my wife I'm still in bed I hear my wife no going getting ready taking a shower

542
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
Then she goes to the closet

543
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,920
And then I hear her

544
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:45,504
Quietly cursing so she doesn't wake me and I'm giggling under the covers because

545
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:50,368
She presses the wink relay so hard that it kind of comes unconnected and then she can't turn the light on

546
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
In the closet

547
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
And I think

548
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,256
I know what's worse is that it's been giggling about it for 6 months now

549
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,328
I decided to research

550
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,632
What works is my wink Hub that way

551
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
Solve this problem so to speak

552
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,496
I can turn the wink relay switch on the promise no

553
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
Where to present where not to but that's only the store

554
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:13,664
And I thought about magnetic connectors and sure enough the gocontrol Home Security Suite

555
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,944
Does work with wink

556
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,344
Arrived just this morning but it's so easy to pair with the Hub and so easy to set up a quick robot

557
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:26,464
Master 2 robots one for the door opening to turn the light on and one for the door closing to turn the light off

558
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
That

559
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,536
I was already able to install it be just

560
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
Breaking for the shelves

561
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,144
Working great which comes off rotation got to be thrilled

562
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,704
I'm going to mention that when I researched this

563
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:42,592
On Amazon I saw one of these motion I'm sorry Wendy's door window sensors for like $35 a month

564
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,384
That's expensive

565
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
But for $42

566
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,712
Just $7 more there was a kid with

567
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:52,064
Two sensors in the motion detector is also I sperm for that makes sense

568
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
So

569
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,696
Also easy to install is the infrared motion sensor witch and now have in my office

570
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
So that way as soon as I walk in

571
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,304
I already have a robot set up to turn the lights on

572
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,608
Not sure when do about turn the lights off yet

573
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,912
And propose to have a wink Hub instead of robots

574
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,544
You don't have to have the running 7 by 24 like it when I walk in my office in the middle of the day I don't want the light on

575
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,592
There are settings in the wink robots

576
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
How to say

577
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
Do it from this time to that time

578
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
I'm so that's what I did for like Sunset to Sunrise

579
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,736
It will turn my lights on so

580
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,040
You right so far they are working right

581
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,600
You should be able to motion detected

582
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,136
Turn it off now I don't know

583
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:33,792
I don't know I kind of CSE I kind of sit still and watch TV or something on my iPad or something and I'm

584
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,608
I'm not moving around so I suspect at night time the White Witch shut off on me

585
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
I'd rather

586
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,168
Not deal with that

587
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
The exciting

588
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
Moving your hands

589
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,568
I'm still here I'm watching a movie

590
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,896
Okay well that's that's a good motion sensor

591
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
Several

592
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Places

593
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Motion sensor

594
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,272
This is actually an open close sensor that's on the

595
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,856
Okay answer you have another one

596
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:02,464
I'm decided yet though I don't know yet about to figure that out

597
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
Liquor cabinet

598
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
That's always open

599
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,840
You must have a hue motion

600
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,864
Sensor

601
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,144
Baidu

602
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
Okay

603
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,472
2 PSI promotion do they

604
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
Offer anything else because

605
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,824
I didn't realize it when I bought it but this gocontrol does

606
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,640
There's a temperature sensor inside but it's not at

607
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,016
Tied into openhab

608
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,832
And then open have picked up the temperature sensor

609
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
And he doesn't show it to me

610
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,904
But open

611
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,000
Will wink shows me the temperature on this motion

612
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:40,096
Sensor which is kind of nice I haven't actually another motion sensor

613
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:46,496
DigiTech temperature now in my very warm office so I might play with some robots for that to see if you had an Echo Show

614
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,080
You could be able to like show me the temperature inside and it'd be like

615
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,360
Bullet for the Wii

616
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,384
I don't know what that

617
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
I'll just send you pictures

618
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,016
Theoretically that should happen

619
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
Siri

620
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,808
All right

621
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
Well let's see I also have something

622
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,392
To tell you guys about

623
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
Because

624
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
I didn't buy it

625
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,720
They sent it to me and then

626
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,768
I sent it back and I bought one

627
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
Is it was already installed

628
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,168
Long story short I have a Leviton

629
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
Wi-Fi

630
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,752
Decora switch this is a

631
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,288
$50 light switch on

632
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:25,664
And it talks to the Amazon Echo without a hub it also talks to

633
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
The

634
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,016
Yes

635
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
And

636
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,672
I wanted to like this lights which I really did

637
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,488
Because I'm a sucker for smart switches and

638
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,816
It's not hard to install it's not hard to hook it up

639
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,632
What it is hard to do is turn the freaking light on

640
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
I hate that

641
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
Isn't that kind of a

642
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,496
Primary purpose of it

643
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,824
Exactly so you only have one job switch

644
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,128
End of the dimming switches this little

645
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,968
Dimmer on the side that's not an uncommon design even for none can

646
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
But I didn't like it

647
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
I hated it

648
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,832
I don't like touching this light

649
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
So

650
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,440
I feel that as a connected product it is

651
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Fine

652
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
It works

653
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,048
What is a product that occasionally I'm going to turn on and off with

654
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
Natural fingers

655
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
I hate it

656
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,144
This is going to be your mileage may vary

657
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
You may love it

658
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:25,312
But I didn't it's it's not it's not that

659
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,336
Play sand I just

660
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
Tell kind of Dewey when you

661
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,224
Press it it's not it's not a click it's more like a

662
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Cinemagic

663
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,136
And it's $50 so you really have to like it my pen

664
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,976
Come with almonds

665
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,768
White and other color so

666
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
You know if your

667
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,328
If you have other Leviton switches

668
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
You know this could be

669
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
That was that

670
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,240
I feel like we answered this but I'm going to answer this again for p

671
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,288
What did new Eero router stick

672
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,896
TL DR version of the says it is backwards

673
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,944
Compatible with your old stuff

674
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,760
If you have the old Eero routers

675
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,832
You shouldn't have to upgrade unless you're going to want

676
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:13,184
Thread Network and then you can just buy a beacon

677
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
And that it's your old system

678
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
Yes so

679
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,280
If you've already got the Eros

680
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,072
You don't need a spring for a whole new system

681
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,632
If you got coverage hole that you want to make better

682
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,680
You know by the $149 Beacon

683
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
So

684
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,776
Just making that Crystal Clear forever

685
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Okay

686
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,664
That's a lot that was a lot for this 4th of July week

687
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,712
I hope you guys didn't blow up any of your appendages

688
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
Shooting out fire

689
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,552
And I will also

690
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
End

691
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
I think that's it we will

692
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,440
Have you guys stay tuned for fari

Welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host

709
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
And today's guest is

710
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,464
Fahri Diner Who is the

711
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,024
CEO and co-founder of plume

712
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,072
Hi Siri how are you doing today

713
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
Hi Stacy

714
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
Great thank you

715
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,656
Excellent

716
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,680
So

717
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,496
I got to talk a lot about Wi-Fi switch is

718
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
Basically the lifeblood of

719
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,568
Get home

720
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,920
People probably no clue as the company that makes these

721
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,992
Plug-in pods that will improve their Wi-Fi experience

722
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
You however

723
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,088
Call yourselves in air traffic control

724
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,648
Can you kind of talk about

725
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,952
What you're actually trying to build with blue

726
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,024
WiFi pods that

727
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,840
We make give you awesome coverage around the home

728
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:34,240
But the key challenge is how to optimize the performance of your Wi-Fi across

729
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,520
Not just space

730
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
These things

731
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,616
Wi-Fi access points or pods

732
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:46,272
Will give you a good coverage around the home but you want to optimize your performance across time as well so you're

733
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:52,672
Wi-Fi not only has to work everywhere around the home but it also has to work all of the time and across a

734
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,768
Changing side of load so we think of it as more of a three-dimensional problem

735
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:03,424
And all of that requires a fairly sophisticated control at management plain and that's really the piece that

736
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,264
So this is the software that's in the cloud and it is

737
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
Actively managing

738
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,592
Network loads across my

739
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,360
House for exam

740
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,664
Also if my doorbell rings things are going to change

741
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,944
Is that how I should be thinking about it

742
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,528
Yep it deals with things there are a lot of things why are they

743
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
And Wi-Fi

744
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:24,672
Particular as you know is a non-deterministic medium unlicensed Spectrum things change

745
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:31,072
And you want to have a system that responds to these changes both dynamically in Rio

746
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:34,400
Real-time as well as preemptively and predictably

747
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,728
So the conclusion control plane be call it

748
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,008
Adaptive Wi-Fi

749
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,312
It deals with things like

750
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:47,712
Both Wireless and wired backhaul management and these multi-node environment so you have to worry about what the backhaul can be

751
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
Migration looks like

752
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,552
It deals with things like handing off client

753
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:57,952
From one pod to another in a smart algorithmic way it deals with things like interference management both in

754
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,512
Inside the home and across multiple

755
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
It also learns

756
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,816
Client and

757
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,608
Device behavior and patterns

758
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,400
To be proactive and predictive

759
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:10,496
Optimization the power of the cloud

760
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,544
Alright so there's a lot that's happening in

761
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,848
And people like myself work

762
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Like crazy Network

763
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,200
Oh my gosh it's up where to find Wi-Fi

764
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,808
How did you come to this idea what was your core philosophy

765
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,088
Especially given

766
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:25,856
Your history

767
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
Clone myself

768
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,184
My co-founders

769
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,208
We are a team of

770
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,512
What's a telecom industry veteran

771
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:38,912
We worked on in Pioneer things like ultra-long-haul ultra-high capacity fiber-optic transport system

772
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:44,032
As well as be caught really high performance Wi-Fi into literally billions of devices

773
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:49,152
And the realization became to maybe about 3 years ago Stacy was that

774
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,200
Oldest digital stuff

775
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:57,600
It's piped into our homes today at a pre-trial fast and reliable and consistent rate but today what happens is older

776
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,416
Stop after going through a lot of fiber Networks

777
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,696
Kallax Networks

778
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,232
Etc they come to our home

779
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,072
Before reaching our devices in the living room something goes terribly wrong

780
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,608
That has to do with Wi-Fi

781
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,424
And also many of internet service providers

782
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
I told us

783
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
That this is a primary source of

784
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,032
Subscriber dissatisfaction

785
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,592
Leading into incoming service calls

786
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,896
Turn which is a very expensive problem

787
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,920
Bananas you know

788
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,480
Let's talk about that because I have peas

789
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,760
Have historically

790
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,808
Well I shouldn't say historically

791
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,624
Play because they've done a lot of things over the years

792
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,928
Important

793
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,208
The Wi-Fi point

794
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,000
Alone The Edge stopped

795
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
At the modem

796
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:41,120
And now what's happening is they seem to be interested once again

797
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
And going beyond that

798
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Talk about

799
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,104
They have to because in our networking days until not long ago open Ben Meade Rudy's Network diagram

800
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,224
Routers and switches in fiber optic Transport Systems on the end of the network

801
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,784
This little picture of a cute little home

802
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
With a nice little roof on it

803
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,392
That was the end of the network in other words that was the

804
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,696
You have the Broadband Gateway if you want

805
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
In the home

806
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,304
Service providers are responsible for providing services to the home

807
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
What has happened now over the last

808
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:17,728
Let's say five years or so is that now they're providing services to the devices in our homes and example

809
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:24,896
Comcast is now saying what they have been saying for a while now you can watch your TV channels on your iPad

810
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,968
There's a little Comcast app now if you're up in the bedroom

811
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,760
Can you click on your app

812
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,576
And the Xfinity is not playing on your iPad

813
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
You have now on the right

814
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,392
Call Comcast

815
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:41,792
Complain you're not particularly complaining about your Wi-Fi you're just saying look Xfinity doesn't work on my iPad

816
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,840
Dinosaur is a service that I'm paying

817
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
If you know what I mean so

818
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
That last

819
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,032
Peace in the home the last 2 or 5 or 10 what have you is now whether they like it or not

820
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,824
An extension of their broadband

821
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,592
Infrastructure

822
00:34:54,848 --> 00:35:00,992
Now it is just as important I might argue in so many ways that is more important than the two thousand miles of fiber.

823
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,040
They use to bring the Broadband to our home

824
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,112
Because that's the piece that the consumer is interfacing to

825
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,160
So this is not an option of saying

826
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:11,232
For service providers moving forward and we're seeing that

827
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,048
They have to own and control

828
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,424
The Wi-Fi peace otherwise it said it's a section in the middle of their Network

829
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
That they don't have

830
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,776
Visibility to and they get blamed for everything okay

831
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,080
So with that in mind I remember when

832
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,104
Wi-Fi

833
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,408
First started coming out

834
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,968
My cable provider the time was Time Warner

835
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,272
And they actually had a

836
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,296
They had a fee

837
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
4 Wi-Fi

838
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,880
It was I think it's like $10 extra a month for

839
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,440
Wi-Fi I remember looking at that

840
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,232
Why can just go buy a router

841
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,000
The Best Buy

842
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,024
Pop that in

843
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
Why would I pay Time Warner

844
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,400
Credit they do have equipment rental fees now so we'll

845
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,704
Cable providers seek to tack on

846
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,520
Additional service charges on top of

847
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Can a better wife

848
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,848
I think some will

849
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,384
And for some

850
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
Customers

851
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,968
We are engaged with many of them

852
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
As you know

853
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:10,368
There will be additional fees from some of them I believe for premium go to Whole home Wi-Fi

854
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
They may also look at it

855
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,208
In tears if your subscribing to ex-

856
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,280
Or second or greater maybe your whole home Wi-Fi

857
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,584
Will become as part of your sex

858
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,168
Scripture some service providers might very well I'll sell you

859
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,704
Devices like pods

860
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,984
Google home coverage

861
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:30,592
So I believe this is an area of that they're looking at both

862
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:35,968
I would say defensively and offensively defensively in the sense that they're very interested

863
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
And they must

864
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,552
Highly reliable WiFi

865
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,904
Offensively in the case that I think the retail in the

866
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,928
Street has pretty much

867
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
Demonstrated

868
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,280
There's value in people are willing to pay

869
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:54,400
Whole-home reliable good wifi and service providers will take advantage of that

870
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:58,752
Now I believe from there isb perspective the defensive part is

871
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,032
Probably more important

872
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
To them

873
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,104
Which means when they go on the offense

874
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,920
And even if they were to charge you for this

875
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
I think it's going to be

876
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,248
Much much more affordable

877
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,576
To get highly reliable whole home Wi-Fi

878
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,624
From your ISP then

879
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,672
It will be to get it from the retail Channel

880
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:23,328
Imagine one of the reasons you're saying this is because you guys have this deal with Comcast this is one of your big service

881
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,376
Provider deals Comcast has made an investment

882
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,936
And they're also reselling and I think

883
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,472
Even helping manufacturer the

884
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,264
Can you kind of go into that

885
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
Pretty please

886
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,872
Of course Comcast is one of our service provider partners

887
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:40,992
I will be launching with them this year as well as a number of other tier-one operators

888
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,832
In the case of Comcast our relationship involves two element

889
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:48,416
That's one is better managing and optimizing their existing Gateway

890
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,464
So that is a very important

891
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,488
Art

892
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,816
The whole infrastructure here whereas when you go out to

893
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,888
Can you go out and buy retail access points

894
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:01,472
Everybody asks you to turn off your service provider Wi-Fi

895
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,240
We think that

896
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
Soulja Boy

897
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,824
Waste the Comcast has very good gateways

898
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:11,456
And there's a piece of Clone software in those gateways that connects it to our cloud

899
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,736
Amanda is an optimizer

900
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,808
And then we will also license

901
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
Our

902
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,368
Design of the pods

903
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:23,232
To our manufacturing Partners who will be able to make and sell them

904
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,536
Directly to service providers like,

905
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,328
We don't really want

906
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,144
To be in the middle trying to get an additional

907
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,216
Margin from these Hardware all in the interest

908
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
Making

909
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,848
The pods and access points as affordable as possible for the office for the consumer

910
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,616
Okay

911
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,432
That makes a lot of sense and it also makes sense with

912
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:45,248
Comcast and other service providers getting into

913
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:50,112
Home automation and security systems because those are definitely things where you want to be able to control the

914
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
Network all the way through

915
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,928
Absolutely

916
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,256
When it comes to retail though let's go back to that

917
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:00,352
Because there has been in the last probably three years just

918
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,912
Scads of new companies coming out with better

919
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,448
New improved WiFi

920
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,008
Erode securifi

921
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,568
Room is in there and even the big vendors of followed suit

922
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,104
And their focus has been on

923
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,128
If he's mesh net

924
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Works

925
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:19,296
And I am curious do you think that consumers are going to go buy their own routers or do you think they're going to turn to the

926
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
The service provider

927
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,112
I know your

928
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
The Surface Pro

929
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,696
But it seems so far that consumers are turning to

930
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
Do these kind of

931
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Off-the-shelf

932
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
Retail system

933
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,304
I don't think the retail

934
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,584
Segment will disappear

935
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,168
There will always be a certain portion of the consumer in my

936
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:40,032
Opinion Google buy their own routers and access points and nationalism song

937
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,056
Statistics

938
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,824
That I know

939
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,104
Are there in the US

940
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:48,480
About 70% of people get their Wi-Fi from their internet service provider

941
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,296
Places like Europe that percentage is even higher

942
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:57,696
So I believe though as the service providers get into whole home highly reliable life

943
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,256
Fight at retail Market segment with string

944
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,816
A lot of them have been launching

945
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,376
New services on top so for example

946
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:10,240
Eros launched a brand new service that does parental controls & Security for

947
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
$10 a month

948
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,616
There's scads of devices all the way from Disney Circle device that does print

949
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,896
Control through a box at

950
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,664
Attached to your network

951
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,968
Another security device

952
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,624
So I'm also looking at those and I'm like hey is that a real or is that something that's going to get eaten by the service

953
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
Is providers

954
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,440
I think the retail players

955
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:33,024
Who rely on Hardware margins are going to see

956
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,584
The price of these things become lower and lower

957
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:41,216
There are no now many players in this market and they're naturally looking for more margin

958
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:45,312
Some of these customers what companies are startups or other companies

959
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:51,200
Obviously they're in it for profit so I believe they're looking at these over-the-top additional services

960
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,760
Ass-kickers to improve their margins now

961
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,576
Problem again there I think that's a good lineup

962
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
Thinking about service

963
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:04,768
This is really the bread and butter of the service provider's whether it security or parental controls and so on that

964
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:11,168
Will all the sort of bundled into are available through your internet service providers

965
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
There is peace

966
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,288
Like I can't see give unless you're like in a very small

967
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,336
Sonic out in California

968
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:23,456
Most people find

969
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:27,552
Verizon so how do you think that might affect how people

970
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,112
See this shift controlling more of

971
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,648
Network inside their house

972
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,976
Everybody knows we all love to hate our service providers

973
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,512
And we blame the forever

974
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,328
You don't even if you are retail Wi-Fi doesn't work

975
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,400
An average consumer Bill calls offense at 11

976
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:48,800
Consumer it in a lot of times I don't even know if they don't even know the difference between tsar of your broadband and Wi-Fi and all that

977
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,592
Somebody says lock the internet

978
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,384
The phone and call wife

979
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,943
Call Comcast for service provider

980
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,967
Obviously

981
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,039
Discuss before the service providers are seeing this

982
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,831
Festival de technology

983
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,927
Whether it's the Silicon or the software

984
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,207
Etc so

985
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,255
I think there are many other reasons

986
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
2

987
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:12,095
Not be happy with our service providers but

988
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:17,983
Yavapai think Wi-Fi performance and Broadband is not going to be one of them and not system

989
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,871
What is the other things that I think is really fascinating about Wi-Fi as we've moved from like this

990
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895
Is I don't know if

991
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
It's like a machine gun

992
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:31,295
Routers just like I'm covering the whole home by sending out message signal

993
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:36,415
To this mesh approach where you like we're going to cover the whole home by having everything kind of work together and then

994
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,951
You guys are taking that too late

995
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,255
WiFi 2.5

996
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
Actively managing it

997
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,303
Cloud

998
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:46,143
But I feel like like Wi-Fi 3. O was going to be

999
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,959
Wi-Fi embedded in just about everything

1000
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,031
It's going to need a connection so I'm going to buy

1001
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,335
TV and it's going to have a Wi-Fi

1002
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,359
Repeater

1003
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,431
Perhaps or maybe it's my cable box if it's ISP model

1004
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,711
How do you envision that

1005
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
Into the world

1006
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,527
We want to enable it

1007
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:08,927
As I mentioned plume is ultimately a control and management playing and you need something like plume to make all of that

1008
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:14,559
That's been our vision from day one there are a lot of Wi-Fi resources that already exist in our home

1009
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,351
Your TV has WiFi

1010
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,679
If you have a Samsung family Hub refrigerator it has Wi-Fi

1011
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,959
Your

1012
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,799
MacBook or iMac that sitting on your desk has WiFi in it

1013
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,103
And largely who using them as client

1014
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,895
They don't contribute to the network

1015
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:34,783
Our vision rvu is that many of these existing Wi-Fi resources that are in the home

1016
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:38,367
Should not only be clients but also should be these

1017
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
Repeater points are Hotpoint

1018
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,463
Pasar Wifi to other clients

1019
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,255
And that requires

1020
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,583
Unified control plane and that's what is all about

1021
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,631
We are also partnering with Samsung

1022
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:53,471
I think you're familiar with this product that they launched recently

1023
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,543
In home product that has

1024
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,359
Really nice iot capability and also

1025
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,151
Bestop mesh WiFi

1026
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:04,223
That device will soon be powered by Klum

1027
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,807
Where you'll be able to see let's say a Comcast

1028
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,623
The Gateway a Samsung connect home

1029
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,927
Access point Igloo parts

1030
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,999
Starting point all working

1031
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,791
Coherently on the same network

1032
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,351
Go to the beginning of this Vision that you just

1033
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:23,167
Describe an in the future we want to roll in

1034
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,703
All these other devices

1035
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,727
To become

1036
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,263
A part of the network

1037
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,055
How does it work technically

1038
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:32,127
Because I know in the case of Comcast at that I have firmware

1039
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,407
On your gateway

1040
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,687
He could have firmware on the

1041
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
Device

1042
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,807
Hear it sounds like there may be something like that happening so are you guys going to be

1043
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:44,671
Software that's going to be at any endpoint and a variety of gateways that just met

1044
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,695
Makes this

1045
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,743
Seamless Wifi between devices

1046
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:52,351
That's right so there's a there's a piece of software in the Gateway

1047
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,887
Your service provider Gateway

1048
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:57,215
Obviously there's a piece of software firmware in r-pod

1049
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:03,615
And we can also put these for my are into other access point or other wifi-enabled devices

1050
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,895
They all talk. Cloud

1051
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:10,783
And we do the coordination across them in terms of treating them as either access points or clients

1052
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:16,671
I'm doing the backhaul configuration among them dealing with interference and so on all from the cloud to the cloud

1053
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,999
Gloom cloud is the element that enables Oliver

1054
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,559
Okay what else do you want to tell me about

1055
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,375
I want to tell you more about how we

1056
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,679
See the control plane right now

1057
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,983
We have focused s on Wi-Fi

1058
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,519
Lte unlicensed Spectrum

1059
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,799
Focused and in the home

1060
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,103
The control plane will also

1061
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,407
Stacy extend into other

1062
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,431
Unlicensed

1063
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,711
Protocols like

1064
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,015
Zigbee Z-Wave Bluetooth and Salon

1065
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:46,367
To really make these protocols at least for my power consumption

1066
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:51,487
Expected as you know how many devices on the iot world are very sensitive to power consumption

1067
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,047
And they do their own measurements on

1068
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:57,887
In our concept you have a Wi-Fi access point literally in every room

1069
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,423
Either by way of quads

1070
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,239
Or other devices that exist in the home

1071
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:08,895
Imagine a world where you able to actually do a lot of networking M on other protocols over Wi-Fi

1072
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,479
So that would save power consumption because you would have to

1073
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
Our devices would have to

1074
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,807
Do quote-unquote shout at a lower DVT

1075
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,087
To reach something

1076
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,695
Exactly image thinking about doing kindness zigbee

1077
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,743
Z wave over wifi

1078
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,047
So instead of these low power

1079
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:30,655
Devices having to speak to each other and mash and do whatever they need to do

1080
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:34,239
Beatrice sang let him just talked to the nearest pot in the room

1081
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,287
And then one another networking

1082
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:41,919
Larry few old we can do this communication and anything quote smashing a month

1083
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,455
That will save a lot of power

1084
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,735
And beyond that

1085
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,783
Y'all let's not forget about the license

1086
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:47,807
Spectrum

1087
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:52,415
So license spectrum is very expensive and it's not really available

1088
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:56,767
So we also see this control plane expanding into

1089
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,839
Author of coordinating across both the license

1090
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
