00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,104
Hey everyone welcome to the 226 episode of The Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,408
C Higginbotham and your co-host

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,432
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:23,552
And we have a spectacular show for you today we're going to be talking about Google

5
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,320
Deciding

6
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,112
Against the Smart Home

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,416
Microsoft has done something

8
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,184
Huge

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,488
For the Enterprise iot

10
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,840
Tile the location tracker company has raised

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,144
He's a lot of money and it's surprising

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
Also going to talk about

13
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,704
Google

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,032
New algorithms to predict energy usage at the device level

15
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:48,128
A device that we're not sure we need and question why

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
Why is it doing a scale

17
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,736
Plus we've got a little bit of news from Huawei

18
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,016
More from Google

19
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784
A little bit

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
Toby

21
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,088
And LG

22
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:01,440
Kevin has also been trying out a new iot security device that you are

23
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
Want to hear about

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,072
Plus this week our sponsor is Dell Technologies talking about building solutions for the medical

25
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
Price Industries

26
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,704
And our guest is Jana welander of a

27
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,752
Company that is launching today

28
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,544
Called crascall

29
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,360
We're going to find out more about that company

30
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
And everything else

31
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
After message

32
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224
Another one of our sponsors

33
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,272
This week sponsor is a pharaoh

34
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,576
Are you doing multiple iot projects

35
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,976
That work well together in a single app that strengthens your brand that is really tough and it requires

36
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,000
Where's the right platform

37
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
Would have Arrow Kenmore lunch 42 smart Appliance models in just two years of Arrow customers have Experian

38
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
As much as an 80% reduction in time-to-market 99% fewer support calls and 10

39
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,104
Tennis higher activation rates

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,872
Bus

41
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,944
They can we use 90% of their work from one project to the next

42
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
Show pic of pharaoh just like Kenmore Mitsubishi bank ufj group and dealing did that beat your competition

43
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:06,976
Patient with a solution that your team loves to build on and your customers love to use

44
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
Learn more at a pharaoh. IO

45
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
Flash go big

46
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,448
So first up we have news from

47
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
Google specifically for

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Reishi

49
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,592
Chandra who is VP of product in general manager at

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
And

51
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
Reishi

52
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,176
Kind of shocked a bunch of

53
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
People by talking

54
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
About

55
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,272
How he doesn't believe in the Smart Home

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
But really that was kind of clickbait

57
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
Edsbs

58
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,488
Google does believe in the smart home Google just doesn't want us to call

59
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,280
I want to call it

60
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Helpful home

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,096
And as people who have

62
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
Covered

63
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:50,240
Google's smart home efforts since they purchase Nest even before then actually

64
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,800
A covered Nest all the way back in

65
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
2012

66
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
When Tony fadell was

67
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
The founder Inn

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Add Google

69
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
This is not a big shift

70
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:04,064
Google Now wants to call this The Helpful home and they want enable it by

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
What they call ambient

72
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,904
I feel like we've even used Ambien

73
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
Computing it used to be a big thing back

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,536
2013 I think it was actually like

75
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,376
Ambien information or ambient display

76
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,216
Which is basically this idea of the devices around you

77
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,544
Are connected somehow and they're going to pull information from

78
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
Apis

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
Other devices

80
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
Your personal data

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,224
And deliver information in a way that isn't like a notification

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
Screen

83
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,784
So good example would be

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,832
An umbrella that lights up when it's

85
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,392
Plan to rain today so you can just grab it on your way out

86
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
China products

87
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
Would you cuz

88
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,048
The problem is we all said hey we buy that

89
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
But then

90
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,376
The business models made it impossible you have to

91
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
A subscription for that umbrella and

92
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,288
If the company went out of business then you'd have this really expensive umbrella if my

93
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Maybe like

94
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
$4 for it

95
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,224
This is true so I will just use the dark sky API and make my own little ambient bulbs next to my umbrella

96
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,272
Right there a bunch of challenges he

97
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
1 is

98
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,880
Probably first and foremost is cost that's how

99
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
Consumers rate

100
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
Who sings cost

101
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
A lot of money and that's historic

102
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,815
In the next big thing for developers and

103
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
Has been there's no standard to make

104
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
These things worked

105
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,703
Surrey she is acknowledging this

106
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,519
He's not really offering a great solution

107
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:32,127
I'll be honest he is saying to Google's efforts to get rid of the nest API

108
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
Part of that solution because it

109
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
It sounds like he's trying to simplify

110
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:40,063
I'm skeptical hat on and say he's just trying to build

111
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
First ecosystem

112
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
But time will tell

113
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
Yeah I mean you're right everything you said I agree with its it's this is not a New Concept we talked about ambient computing

114
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
We're still waiting for

115
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
The Ambien Os from

116
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,423
Essential Indie Ruben's company

117
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
I think she probably

118
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Keep waiting on

119
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
You're waiting

120
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
I think so

121
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,663
I do see this as not a rebranding but a

122
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,735
Focus away from your privacy and data

123
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,271
Because of all of the

124
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,599
People's concern valid concerns about giving up your data

125
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,951
Because this is actually part of the Google Assistant

126
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:23,583
Mantra to its be more helpful assistant that would be madaio helpful helpful helpful

127
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,423
I think they're tying it all together now with the hardware products number one

128
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,239
And to buy saying helpful assistant

129
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
Your focus Less on

130
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:37,663
Smart sand data and such when yes the beta model doesn't change you still need to give up

131
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Some data

132
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
To have the this helpfulness

133
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,807
Maybe people will think about

134
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
Giving up that date as much

135
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
Well I think what's important to think

136
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Here

137
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
Is that your giving up your data

138
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
To get something

139
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
Back right you're giving update but it's

140
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
Presumably

141
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
Or service that you

142
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
In Google has been very

143
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
Even as far back as like to

144
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
2014

145
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
And talking to Google about this thing

146
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
Google doesn't work

147
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,711
Advertise to yuan wants to use this data to build better

148
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Hair products

149
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Now

150
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
You may hate that

151
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
Because they are going to

152
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,855
Design products that

153
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
Based on your data

154
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,999
And those products maybes things like services

155
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Hardware

156
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
Timeously

157
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
It's using your data and service of

158
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
Which some people

159
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,079
Data is the new gold Royal so they're not the only ones doing

160
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,687
I do actually I do

161
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,479
If it's the new oil is

162
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,527
I think the insights derived from the

163
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Are the True Value

164
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
I think

165
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,671
The idea of

166
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
Because I also think

167
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
Unlike oil

168
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Which you know

169
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,839
The people want to control and Chorale the data

170
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,911
You can get data from a lot of different places

171
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,703
There's no one logon

172
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
Data streams necessarily

173
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
There's a few items were

174
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
There's going to be a cop

175
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,895
And it also encourages this model of scarcity

176
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,455
In a way that I don't think is going to

177
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Help with that

178
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,575
The creation of Standards or getting us to a place where like the internet is

179
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
So if you want ambient

180
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Computing

181
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
That date is going to have to

182
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
Cher

183
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
Burdensome meaning

184
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Format

185
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Across different

186
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
Where consumers have to buy into like a

187
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Open

188
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,983
This is true but that also leads directly to our next door

189
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
I'm so glad

190
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,847
I saw that coming a mile away

191
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Yeah it was

192
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
Speaking of data share

193
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Microsoft

194
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
And this is why I'm excited about

195
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
Microsoft

196
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,111
Has created three pre-design licensing

197
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
For data sharing

198
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
They're basically trying to do

199
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
4-Digit sharing

200
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
What open source

201
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
It's so

202
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,863
Bees licensing agreements

203
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Will let people

204
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
Do

205
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
A couple different things so

206
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
There is an open use of data

207
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,127
And that's for use with open datasets don't have any personal data and they're not

208
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
Set the most open

209
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
Least restrictive

210
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,015
Creative Commons

211
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
But with that

212
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,855
Creative Commons of data

213
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,159
And then they have a computational Yusuf

214
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:35,071
And this is designed for using different datasets for AI training purposes that contain third-party batiri

215
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,655
So it's a contract for use with a database

216
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,983
It will have open data but also copyright

217
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
Protectable

218
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,823
Pieces of data like photos or

219
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Maybe some text

220
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,407
You can use it to train

221
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
But you can't

222
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Republish that data

223
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
Or redistributed

224
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
The

225
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
Protected

226
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
And so think of something

227
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Like

228
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Maybe it's

229
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Imagery

230
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
Definition for Ana

231
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,999
Animals and maybe they pull data from

232
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
Customers homes

233
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,863
Or maybe is image recognition for brands of

234
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Do dinner

235
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
Pulling data from smart

236
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Cartridges

237
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,495
And so would be training for that

238
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,335
Training for like recognizing different foods that could then be used in life

239
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,895
Point of sale systems at grocery stores

240
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,735
Grey and the data itself would be used for the modeling and learning

241
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:29,343
But would not be directly shared like those images for sample would not be

242
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,623
Shared across

243
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Platform Beer Company

244
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,487
And then they've created the most restrictive license

245
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,535
Switch is there data use agreement for open

246
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Development

247
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,375
And this is basically

248
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
Proprietary data

249
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
This is for sharing stuff

250
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
2 train models

251
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
What date is it

252
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Proprietary

253
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
I'm actually really excited by this

254
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,663
And we talked a little bit about why that matters

255
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
Ambient computing

256
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,783
What is also really important for things like in a world where we're going to have

257
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,599
Gdpr and you're trying to build

258
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
Algorithmic models

259
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,695
For doing something

260
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,791
Having this sort of contract in place is going to make it cheaper in

261
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Faster

262
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
To share releve

263
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
Data entry

264
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,191
Rest on pretty secure Legal Foundation

265
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Interesting

266
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,359
Is if these contracts hold up against something like gdpr where

267
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
Retroactively

268
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Information

269
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,503
Like if I could send the right hook

270
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Data

271
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
My image dated for exam

272
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Then

273
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
Do they have to pull that from Mike

274
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
Any training since we don't know yet

275
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,887
Until these are proposals are actually publicly available so you can comment on this proposal

276
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
Yeah I taken the whole open approach

277
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,055
I think there's another benefit here from the consumer side like

278
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,359
We typically don't want our

279
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,663
Told us that we capture on our phones

280
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Scanned and such right

281
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
We know that happens

282
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,783
Today napping say with Google photos for example

283
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
I knew

284
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
That

285
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,391
As example table Google

286
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
Says we subscribe to the

287
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Second

288
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,999
On the computational use of data agreement

289
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
We're just going to use this for

290
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,191
Training are models and none of your data will ever be on that so you didn't steal your data

291
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:24,287
What we will use is the aggregated machine learning model

292
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,103
Gather for everybody maybe a little bit

293
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,175
More of a sense of security from a consumer standpoint

294
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
100

295
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
Percent

296
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,783
And I also think in the corporate Realm

297
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,111
One of the things that has been very challenging

298
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Is

299
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:44,255
The legal teams are looking at some of the data that like an industrial Manufacturing

300
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,815
That you can get from the lines and they're like

301
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Whoa Nelly

302
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,887
We don't want to share this highly proprietary

303
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
Information with anyone

304
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
And in that makes sense but

305
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,311
There's no contracts right now for that

306
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,383
People are trying to develop them and this gives

307
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,711
Those companies and those legal teams a starting

308
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,783
Place they may not want their stuff to be licensed this way

309
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
But it at least gives

310
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,903
Them the added haft of Microsoft's legal team

311
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Helping them

312
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
Define terms in in

313
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Pick things out

314
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,375
I'm really excited about this I think it's a big deal and I will also say that Microsoft

315
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,263
Has been thinking about building marketplaces for data and sharing data like this

316
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
Basically the last 10 year

317
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
I have talked to people on is

318
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
All the way back when I was

319
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
Was brand new

320
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
2009 2008

321
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
And I have been waiting for this

322
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
Okay

323
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Just

324
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Kevin

325
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Yeah

326
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,351
We were both surprised to see this but we'll share the good news for tile

327
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
Bluetooth Tracking Company

328
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,727
45 million dollars in a series

329
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
Beef Underground

330
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
Yeah

331
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
Kevin Kline

332
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,871
Well and I say that because I think it was

333
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,687
Last year that they laid off a bunch of folks

334
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
They

335
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,807
Jigger pivoted their products to be at

336
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,415
Subscription service and they're also going to license their technology

337
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:23,327
And I didn't think that was going to really work for them at the time but apparently it is and that seems counter to 2

338
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,887
Since they just raised more money you think maybe there is

339
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Now they're running out of funds

340
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
You know they haven't shared

341
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,567
Figures from their new subscription premium services

342
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,639
It is vastly exceeded expectations so

343
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,479
I guess they want the money to expand beyond what

344
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,551
Products they have in the current subscription service I do not know

345
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,855
So here's what this is about

346
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
There's a cop

347
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
What is bride fundraising in

348
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Inflation

349
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,255
Your resentment wheezing is just across the

350
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Everybody's raising

351
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,655
That's one but two is something I wrote about

352
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,215
So it is about Bluetooth

353
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
Back when

354
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
The most recent iteration of Bluetooth

355
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
Came out

356
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,383
What came out with it is granular tracking

357
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,943
This granular tracking let you

358
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
Basically understand where something is

359
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
Few inches

360
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,343
So not just like oh it's in your study but

361
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
You can say

362
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,903
Your keys are in your city on the table

363
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Provided you know

364
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
What the table is

365
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,791
So that's really important for location tracking

366
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
Which is a huge

367
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,631
Industrial and Enterprise iot

368
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
And it's also good for

369
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
The other side is tile has

370
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543
Put their SDK

371
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,663
Nordic Bluetooth chips Bluetooth chips from Silicon labs

372
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
And I think from

373
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
Other big Bluetooth

374
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
Herbs

375
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Insta

376
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,903
Now a company can actually just buy a Bluetooth chip that already has tile integrated on it

377
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
Which means just like

378
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,767
With Apple's location finding feature for MacBooks

379
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
You could have

380
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Location finding

381
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Chess pie

382
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
Virtue of having a boy

383
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
Bluetooth device

384
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
Even if you're not carrying it

385
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
Southern Network expands

386
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,103
So this money will help tile go up against

387
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,247
In Google Google is also supposedly

388
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
About a Bluetooth tape

389
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
So

390
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,623
What we could see is tile

391
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,231
Genuine the consumer but also releasing tags for any number of things

392
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:32,351
And basically creating a really good Bluetooth based location

393
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
More power to him I hope it works out

394
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,519
Yeah well I think that's I mean it's a good play

395
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
They will need money for it so

396
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
That's what I

397
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Stinky

398
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,687
Okay so let's turn to

399
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,015
Cool uses of data

400
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,367
Yeah I would never say combination IRT in machine learning

401
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
What is

402
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:02,559
So Google has posted on its Google Cloud blog a really detailed

403
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,839
Technical

404
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,399
Blog post about the real time prediction

405
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,471
Operation status of appliances

406
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
But using machine learning

407
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
They're not the first

408
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,103
People to do this to me we seen actual products that

409
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
Can monitor

410
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,943
Down to the individual circuit level of

411
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,015
What power draw is coming from an appliance and

412
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
Give you insights into that

413
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
Those typically do it with

414
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,391
Hardware at the circuit level

415
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,695
This is actually using machine learning

416
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
To predict which

417
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,839
Device in your home which appliance is currently on or should be on

418
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
We shouldn't be on based on the

419
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,679
Time of day I mean if your TV

420
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,031
Turns on in the middle of the night that would be workable cause an abnormal situation for most people

421
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,615
Not for me because I sometimes watch TV in the middle of night

422
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,943
And the idea here it with this project is to

423
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,759
Make the system Smarter with machine learning

424
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,551
To hopefully predict

425
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,367
When appliances go on go off

426
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,183
How much power they should use and then gather insects

427
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:06,815
Again it's rather technical but I think it's a good read

428
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,703
Let's tie back to ambient Computing cuz basically This falls back into that same category

429
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
Let's look at what's happening in your home

430
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,311
Let's make some educated guesses

431
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,383
And then the next step after years

432
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Confident

433
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,759
This person is watching TV in the middle of the night which is weird the Ambien computer

434
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
May make a

435
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
Suggestion about

436
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,391
Do you want a glass of warm milk

437
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
Or maybe it'll

438
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Add that to your

439
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,767
Yourhealthfile there's a lot of potential

440
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
Some of its goods

441
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
Could be used against us

442
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
So

443
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Take it forward

444
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
All right

445
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,263
Let's talk about not a smart ambient

446
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
Computing kind of device

447
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
Justify

448
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Nice

449
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,871
Another head scratcher

450
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
This is a

451
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Product

452
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
It's Kathy

453
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
It's a product

454
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
It's called the omnific

455
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,391
And it's a device you stick on your keyring

456
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,951
Scotch apolos tracking software in it

457
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
And it

458
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
Has buttons on it that will let you do things like

459
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
That you can program to do

460
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
Turn your lights on

461
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,935
I don't know you're not excited about this

462
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:22,591
Too much only because it's a Kickstarter project and that doesn't mean I shouldn't be excited excited about those before

463
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,967
It's at a lower price right now it will be expect

464
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,503
Tip for $120

465
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,831
It's as you said that the Bluetooth locator power bi

466
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,999
Is a remote shutter button for your phone a panic button to send a preset text message in your GPS coordinates

467
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
Little mini flashlight

468
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
I guess

469
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,631
I sit here and look at this and say

470
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,959
My phone could really do all this and I carry my phone

471
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,031
Pretty much everywhere so why do I need to carry a fob to

472
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,407
Maybe it's just me by the person does not carry your phone everywhere so maybe

473
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Something you're interested in

474
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
Baby and it also has an LCD screen

475
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,551
Which is worth noting cuz that helps you understand

476
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
And what exactly you're about to

477
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,439
To me it's like the Swiss army knife or one of those like Leatherman Multi-Tool

478
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,743
Some people need them

479
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Some people

480
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:17,119
Don't I'm going to go with I don't need something like this nothing about this appeals to me

481
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:21,727
If you're the type of person who like wants to go running

482
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
Keysight

483
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
I don't know

484
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
I talked to them

485
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,359
And the guys that

486
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Make this keeper

487
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,223
It is not a device for me it's probably a device for Subway

488
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:37,343
And if it's a device for you if you're like a Swiss army knife person the Leatherman Tool

489
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,647
But the digital equivalent of that then

490
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
Check this out

491
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:49,375
Yeah and your example is actually a good one because I I run and I often have a toenail to you can I could watch or something

492
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
That most people

493
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Sade

494
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,775
But even so I don't think this has any Wi-Fi or LTE

495
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
Connectivity to a server

496
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,359
If you hit the panic button for example

497
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
It's going to need your phone to send the message

498
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
It's a head-scratcher

499
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,039
People who don't want to open their phone but just want a quick access to

500
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Physical

501
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
I don't know

502
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
Not for us

503
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,719
Wait we've got one more head scratcher

504
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
Kevin

505
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
Why is Weis doing

506
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
A scale

507
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
This is

508
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,887
Actually it's not super

509
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,191
But why scale we've heard about this

510
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,799
Descale actually reach at the SEC so there's photos

511
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,335
It looks like a smart scale

512
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
I don't know how else to

513
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,759
This is a totally different direction for lies because it's no health-related

514
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,623
That leads me to believe they'll have more health-related products with a scale alone isn't going to

515
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,951
Do much other than you know send the data to your

516
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
For your phone

517
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,767
It's just a new

518
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,583
I can you plot twist in the wild strategy

519
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,423
Yeah and they are doing the pre-orders for their plug

520
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
Looks like

521
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,031
So if you are a y subscriber pre-orders

522
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,103
Set the plugged in Tuesday the 30th of July

523
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
And

524
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
You can check those

525
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
Out

526
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,735
Two plugs for twenty bucks is pretty good to I-5 closed

527
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
Yeah

528
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,855
There you go and I ain't a couple weeks ago said that this is a smart company

529
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,672
Smart home company to watch because I think it's cheap

530
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
Chinky

531
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,560
Is easy to experiment with this and let people play and it's pretty easy for

532
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,352
For people to actually implement

533
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
You don't Maybe

534
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
Health is a big

535
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
Market

536
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,776
Being able to monitor people from afar

537
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
Is probably

538
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,104
Useful for a lots of

539
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
And doing so

540
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
Cameras a little intrusive

541
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
But having a scale and maybe some

542
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,296
Sensors somewhere

543
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Make sense

544
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
And heck

545
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,440
If I had a digital scale that was like 40 or 50 bucks I buy it

546
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,488
Not sold

547
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Unlikely hundred

548
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
2000

549
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,352
$100 scales that are out there that

550
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,400
Connect to like my Fitbit or my

551
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Whatever

552
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,704
Other systems there are

553
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
I actually am

554
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,336
I mean I step on the scale so rarely

555
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
No I'm like

556
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
I can manually

557
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,248
I bought the Fitbit Aria and I do use it so

558
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,088
Long-term insights into my

559
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
Burgeoning belly instructions

560
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
Excellent

561
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
We'll see what happens

562
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
Some quick

563
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
News beds

564
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
Are you ready

565
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
Chloe

566
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,888
Vice president at Wawa

567
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
Chinese firm

568
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,008
Has confirmed that there OS is for the iot

569
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Not for smartphone

570
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
This is notable because

571
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Couple months ago

572
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,176
The US said hey don't use any quality stuff

573
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,992
Google is like

574
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,552
That's okay we have our own

575
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
Weather

576
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
Say that

577
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
So

578
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
Ndk

579
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
Beaver

580
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,048
Kunming OSS variety people

581
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,120
Trademarks and Sachin figured just assumed basically

582
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,704
It's going to be the Android replacement or Plan B for a while I so

583
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,008
Maybe I'll mango s is for iot

584
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
We don't know

585
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
Always founder said

586
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:13,920
I'm saying is not designed for phones as everyone thinks we didn't develop the OS

587
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Replace Google

588
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:20,320
Google does withdraws iOS for Huawei we will need to start building an ecosystem because we don't have a clear plan

589
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
That's his quote

590
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,392
And that's pretty good

591
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,952
So maybe he's telling the truth that he would really like

592
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
All right

593
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,584
What else do we have we have Google assistance

594
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,608
They're better now

595
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,424
If you're using the Abode security system

596
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:42,080
Yeah that's good I think up till now you can only use the Google Assistant to control

597
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,640
Light switches and smart plugs

598
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:48,224
You can ask assistant you are Marigold system

599
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,064
And even disarm the security system

600
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
PIN code

601
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,928
The assistant commands also move beyond the original

602
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,072
Liberty devices now to include smart locks crossword

603
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:06,912
Router range of support on Abode for Google assistant voice commands

604
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,216
Voice command

605
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:13,056
Adobe has put out some new research related to their voice Summit

606
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,336
What is happening

607
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
This week

608
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:21,760
What they found is 91% of brands are already making a big investment

609
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
Improving the user experience

610
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
However

611
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,392
Most consumers are saying

612
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
Yes voice

613
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:34,560
Technologies easy-to-use but over half report that finding the process of using

614
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,864
Voice technology Nantes

615
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
And

616
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,192
49% say they

617
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,496
Don't necessarily know how to begin to accomplish a

618
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,312
And that makes sense that's things like hay

619
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
Madam a

620
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,640
Open blah blah blah to do

621
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
That's

622
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,344
And what a Dobby and actually Amazon's people are doing response

623
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
Need for boys designer

624
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,672
So this is a ux designer

625
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,696
Turquoise and

626
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:08,096
In Amazon is come out and said hey you should use things like storyboarding when you are designing a skill for madam

627
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,936
And that's what Adobe is talk about the US

628
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
Requirements

629
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,520
With the screen without a screen

630
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
And

631
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
I agree

632
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
I do think

633
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,944
Voice right now we are still at the very early stages we need the equivalent of

634
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:27,040
Like I was caught in a pinch to zoom for voice which is basically

635
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
A universal set of

636
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Commands

637
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
That work for

638
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
Aperitif

639
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,184
Small setup

640
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,864
That makes sense I look beyond that and say with machine learning and AI

641
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
You should be able to ask

642
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
For something in

643
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:48,544
Any way shape or form that make sense to you and the system she correctly interpreted

644
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,104
But that's not today that is the future

645
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
Yeah

646
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:57,504
In part of it isn't the understanding of the speech it's time that speech back to

647
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,576
The API call or the app that needs to be

648
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Engaged

649
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,136
Write to me it's context

650
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,464
The problem here isn't necessarily understanding

651
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
What we want

652
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,816
It's snowing how to implement that

653
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
Bingo

654
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,912
And that stuff for

655
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
Library

656
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
So

657
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Pussy

658
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,848
Finally for those of you guys who are into

659
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,408
And you are also into LG

660
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
ATVs

661
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
Guess what

662
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Your LG TV

663
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
Gets

664
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,576
Homekit enabled

665
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
Play

666
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
Apple music

667
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
On

668
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,720
And you can control the TV via Siri

669
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:39,744
It's pretty basic

670
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
But

671
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,144
We dishonor home care that it doesn't move forward enough and this is a step forward for people going

672
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,936
Go to the new LG TV

673
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,032
Really new TV

674
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
That

675
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,176
Feels like enough news for this experience with a new device

676
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,784
Let's do that and I will try to keep this short because

677
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,368
Hey there is so much to talk about

678
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
I have a written review of it

679
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,208
That you can go and see all the details and screenshots

680
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
Firewalla

681
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,816
And what is his

682
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:19,680
Depending on the model you purchase freezer 110 or $180

683
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
It

684
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,752
Basically

685
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,800
Monitor your home network

686
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,616
When I'm at home at work I don't just mean

687
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,456
What people are surfing on their phones and what you're watching on TV

688
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,736
But also

689
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:37,088
What servers your iot device data is going through because

690
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,744
We think we know where that's going to trust these companies to say that we're just going to take your data to make better products

691
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,792
Learn how to

692
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,608
Protect a person in from our webcam

693
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
Do you really know

694
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
You don't

695
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
You're kind of trust

696
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,496
With the fire wallet you really know because

697
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:58,080
It literally shows the entire network flow

698
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
Every device in your home

699
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:00,896
And shows

700
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,944
Where daddy is going the servers

701
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,016
Who owns the servers with the IP address of the servers are

702
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,064
Maybe has the

703
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,416
Ownership of the URLs I mean even what country and location

704
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,952
And luckily

705
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,256
After adding a firewall to my house

706
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:21,632
Defer my devices with going where I expected it to go so that's a good thing

707
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,704
But again I tend to buy the name brand stuff with

708
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,728
Friends I trust

709
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:31,872
This is a super small device it's literally the size of a USB phone charger it's really small

710
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,712
It's just a small processor and SD card for the operating system

711
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,528
Ethernet port to plug into your router and

712
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,320
USB for power

713
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,136
App that comes with it

714
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,416
Very very good

715
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,976
Literally shows you every device on your network

716
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,560
What the upload and downloads are the bandwidth used

717
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,632
And again where those devices are surfing to

718
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:58,752
Even what types of apps are using this gets into some of the aspects

719
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
But

720
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:06,432
If you're using social media a lot on your phone it will group activity by social media activity or email activity or

721
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,224
Messaging activity

722
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,296
In which case you can use some of the one touch control is to

723
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:15,904
Turn off all social networking on my network for an hour and have family time

724
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,184
Or maybe you want to block

725
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,792
Sites access to gaming sites or p******** or whatever you like

726
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,328
There's a ton of

727
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
Control such as that

728
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
Some other things that it has

729
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
It

730
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
Will surface alerts

731
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,056
Detect abnormal uploads or downloads from one device and interesting Lee

732
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,872
I get that other quite a bit from the June oven

733
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,688
That's only because firewall abnormal

734
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,272
So in the middle of the night maybe two Mega potato was set up to

735
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:49,696
AWS servers I found that out thinks of fire wallet because June now uses for AWS

736
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:56,352
You can block that any of its if you think it's abnormal you can block that from happening again or I just mute the June oven now because

737
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,912
I don't care that it's sending its data to

738
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:03,008
Lejeune folks

739
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,544
Yes indeed

740
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
Yes indeed

741
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:10,176
Think of it as if it was sending my videos from my

742
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:15,296
A camera to submergence a China or Russia I would see that I could block it

743
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,856
And start wondering should I be using a device anymore

744
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
Very handy

745
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
Another Nifty feature

746
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,512
You get a built-in VPN server on this little box

747
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:30,144
And that is awesome because a you should be using a VPN server when you're out and about on public Wi-Fi

748
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,984
There's no subscription fee which is typically

749
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,032
Something that comes with a VPN server

750
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,848
Because a third party will have to operate a server

751
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,152
Since the servers in your house there's no fee

752
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
And even better

753
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,736
This was a huge concern I had

754
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:49,088
If I am out of town they live in another country say we're Netflix

755
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,136
How can I use this

756
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,672
You know how can I watch Netflix

757
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,232
Because the VPN servers in my home

758
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,048
Netflix thinks I am still at home in Pennsylvania

759
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,168
And therefore I can watch Netflix it would not block if I was in a country that does not support it so

760
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:07,264
No fees and the location of the VPN server is your home location

761
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,824
I love that that was

762
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
Huge concern

763
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,896
Where can I watch it

764
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:19,552
All of our all of our online content is online no more cable so

765
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:24,672
YouTube TV Amazon Prime that's about

766
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,536
It protects against malware there's a built-in ad blocker I turn that on

767
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,816
If we don't have to

768
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,120
Blockers on all of my individual devices

769
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
It's just off

770
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,216
How much

771
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:45,408
If you get the red version they're coming to Colors the red version is if your home internet speeds are

772
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,968
100 megabits per second or less

773
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:52,064
That is normally 129 I see it for 109 right now

774
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,392
I tested the blue firewalla which is for

775
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,928
Internet speeds

776
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,232
Approaching or Beyond 1 gigabit per second

777
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,280
Which is what happened to house at my house

778
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
4 speeds

779
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,888
That is normally 199 I see it for 179 right now

780
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
And just

781
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,496
To point out I did test it adding a firewall

782
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:14,080
Slows my home internet or my internal Wi-Fi

783
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:19,456
It didn't seem to I didn't lots of testing and in my house with my configuration

784
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,504
I don't see any noticeable

785
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Speed difference

786
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:26,880
You may see that depending on the brand of router to use or the technology or

787
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,440
Your home's architecture I do not know but

788
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
I did not see that

789
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,536
I have to point out the one flaw that I found because it

790
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,560
We're going for

791
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,608
There's a known issue

792
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,168
When using fire wallet with Google Wi-Fi

793
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,240
They believe the company thinks it's related to how

794
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,336
Google either refresh Azar flushes it's DNS every 2 to 3 hours

795
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
And the reason

796
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:51,968
I knew about it was because every two to three hours after using this with my Google Wi-Fi

797
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,016
My home internet when have no access to the outside

798
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,040
It was

799
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
Crazy frustrating

800
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,136
Resolution for now

801
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
Which does work

802
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,744
Is to take you a Google WiFi access point

803
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,792
Put it into bridge mode

804
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,704
Which works however that means you've disabled Mesh networking over Wi-Fi and therefore I have a Google Wi-Fi

805
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Fastest plane

806
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,520
Your mouth is doing absolutely nothing

807
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
I got to say

808
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,640
Frustrating as it is to not have my with Mesh networking coverage

809
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:24,736
I am so impressed by this product that I almost don't mind

810
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
Wow

811
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:30,624
And I'm looking at this and I'm like okay I'm paying ten bucks to Eero for monitor

812
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,696
This actually offers me more

813
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
So

814
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,280
I got a hundred twenty bucks a year going to Eero

815
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,096
And that could be for the foreseeable future

816
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
Which Year by the way is

817
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
Amazon

818
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
And I'm like

819
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,520
Oh you know for a hundred eighty bucks maybe I just

820
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,800
On this for a while

821
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,592
It sounds better

822
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,480
Yeah I mean I don't think and I don't know for sure cuz I don't have any row but I don't think you can monitor down to the

823
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,808
Low-level all the way through to the end servers

824
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
I can see data have

825
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,952
It has the ad blocker it has parental

826
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,000
What controls but I can't see the level 2

827
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
Which you can see

828
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:14,144
Let's put it this way if you don't want to see that level of detail I'm sure

829
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:18,752
You do and I do but not everybody does so what I'm going to say is

830
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,336
If you're happy with the network monitoring that you have in place today

831
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,128
No, I wouldn't buy this

832
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:27,456
Unless you want to add a VPN or have those fine-grained controls

833
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,504
Spitfire wallet

834
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,576
If you want the net worth of clothes for your device date is going

835
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:37,184
There are other options you could build your own you could run a Raspberry Pi to monitor Network traffic

836
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:41,792
But this is really well done from an end-user standpoint with the app that

837
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,096
I probably wouldn't bother building I would just get this

838
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:50,496
Got it will thank you so much Kevin for testing that out for us I will link to the review in the show notes

839
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,568
And now it is.

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,928
I am Dean I live in Minnesota

863
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,976
I real simple question but I

864
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,024
Sing to find the answers on eye

865
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,048
Search this

866
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,096
I use Hue Lights

867
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,376
In my house and

868
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,912
As a gift I was given

869
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,472
Three more to which I use

870
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
For my

871
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,080
Lights on the outside on the garage in the entryway

872
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,872
What is the safe

873
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,176
Is it safe car what are the risks

874
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,968
Whether it be Heat

875
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:07,296
Or as we can experience Minnesota extreme cold

876
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,136
Keeping them out there or is there any

877
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,208
And if not what are some options without adding

878
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,488
Other

879
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512

00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
Talk to you later

886
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
Alright so we have

887
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
Question out there in

888
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,056
Frozen Frigid North

889
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
And Richard

890
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:35,456
Had a similar question which was about smart outdoor lights and battery powered switches

891
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,760
He was trying to avoid a hug but I don't think

892
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,576
First step

893
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344
Deed

894
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,624
Hue Lights

895
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,648
They are lovely

896
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
I love them

897
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,000
There only one pair of hue outdoor lights

898
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,024
The par38

899
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,328
Those are rated to use down

900
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,864
-4 degrees

901
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
Which

902
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,216
Provident Credit in Minnesota

903
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:03,616
Yeah that's your outdoor lights if you're using an indoor light outdoor there rated to use to -10 degrees

904
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,432
Celsius which is 14 degrees

905
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
Which I know.

906
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,528
Brexit would be fine here

907
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
In Seattle

908
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,136
But that's one

909
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:20,512
That's what they're rated for they may work in lower temperatures but you're obviously you're taking a chance

910
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,328
Yeah so we did not find

911
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,352
A lot of smart

912
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,960
Puerto Rico Primus net worth

913
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,008
That's just a function of

914
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,104
She will also offers a few outdoor

915
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
Pictures

916
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,920
But we could not find

917
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,504
At their ip44 rated which protects against debris

918
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,576
But we could not find information about temperature

919
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:46,880
So

920
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,464
The bottom line is I'm not sure how those are going to fair in your

921
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,488
Hirsch Minnesota

922
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,304
Feel free to let us know

923
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,656
If you guys have a harsh winter and have Hue Lights deployed outside

924
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,192
Talk to us about them

925
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,472
Otherwise

926
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
There's not a lot of options

927
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
One option is

928
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,360
Keeping your

929
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,664
Old balls in swapping out

930
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,456
For a smarter switch that might be in

931
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
Protected

932
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
Area

933
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,040
But that involves playing

934
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,624
Dealing with

935
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
Richard

936
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,720
Who is a related voicemail he wanted

937
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:27,328
Smart outdoor lights and a battery-powered switch because his house has terrible wiring

938
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,120
So he would like

939
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400
Switch inside that

940
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
Controls outdoor

941
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
He wanted

942
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,008
Because of power consumption

943
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,568
There are no Wireless WiFi switches

944
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,848
That we can find

945
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,384
An option is Bluetooth

946
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,176
I don't know how far away

947
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
Star from your switch

948
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,504
My best

949
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
Recommend

950
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,040
Station

951
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,320
Was actually

952
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
To do

953
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,672
He's in Massachusetts so there are temperature construe

954
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,208
Prince here as well but

955
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,024
Is to do maybe the Hue bulbs outside

956
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,840
Especially if they're honest like a protected enclosure

957
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,400
And get the $25

958
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,240
Light switch that can be mounted to a wallet

959
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
Control those ball

960
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,056
Now

961
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,848
That does require buying a hue hub

962
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,432
If you don't want to do that you want to watch near a tub

963
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,224
I would recommend doing

964
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,248
A SmartThings Hub

965
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,784
And then do a zigbee

966
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,088
Z-Wave switch indoor to control

967
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,696
The lights can be Wi-Fi power they can be whatever you want as long as they work

968
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
SmartThings

969
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,024
A couple of options therapy

970
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,304
Publicist

971
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,840
Really tough

972
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,376
Publison Wi-Fi

973
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,936
WiFi stuff for battery power

974
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,704
Constraint

975
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
Purposes

976
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
And so if you don't want to plug something in

977
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
Wireless is tough

978
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
And

979
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,384
Publicis. Smith you can't do by Fire Bluetooth

980
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
Bluetooth is tough because of

981
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,712
Brain tissues

982
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,016
Psy

983
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,064
The smart home is still an ongoing effort

984
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
All right

985
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,744
Don't call this Mark Thomas The Helpful hunt That's right The Helpful Home full of ambient Computing is still an ongoing effort

986
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,512

Stay tuned

1002
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,464
For our guest Jana welinder of

1003
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
Craftable

1004
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:37,888
Crossville is a brand new company launching today the bills apps for companies that don't want to do

1005
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Their own

1006
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:44,032
And we talked about why that might be necessary the advantages disadvantages

1007
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,568
This whole business

1008
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
After

1009
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
A words

1010
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,384
From our sponsor

1011
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,224
This would sponsor is Dell Technologies

1012
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,624
Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week

1013
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,184
How far is Dell Technologies and today

1014
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,304
We're doing by Brian Jones was a general manager for the OEM and iot solutions

1015
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
@delta

1016
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
Brian

1017
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,728
I understand you were also recently asked to serve as one of the executive sponsors

1018
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,544
4 Dell Technologies iot and Edge bed

1019
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,104
Can you briefly share with us how your group

1020
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
Is helping cost

1021
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:26,016
Thanks for having me on it's really great to have an opportunity to chat with you

1022
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:30,368
So from an oem perspective focused on

1023
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,024
Helping them take their IP combined it with our technology and create a new product that they take tomorrow

1024
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,864
In our customers have been doing iot since long before

1025
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,144
Iot had a name

1026
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,496
Natural place to help with the iot and Edge of division

1027
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:50,336
And so what we do is we really help customers focus on and deliver three things

1028
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,895
Help them to press their time-to-market

1029
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,967
So they focus on their it we focus on

1030
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,783
The technology platform in the integration of the two

1031
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,367
The second piece is really delivering tier-1 technology

1032
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,439
And that should one technology gets them the very best Quality Inn

1033
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,463
Customer experience

1034
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:12,863
And then the last piece is one of their multinational or they're a small software startup we help them scale globally reduce

1035
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,143
Cost and complexity

1036
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,703
And taking their product to a global market

1037
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
Excellent

1038
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,007
And I understand that your division

1039
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
Is pretty

1040
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:24,639
Compared to what most of my audience thinks about when they think about Dell Technologies

1041
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:30,015
They're thinking servers NPCs but your division focuses more on Factory floors than Data Center

1042
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,063
It's ot not it

1043
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
Is that right

1044
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
That's right

1045
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,719
Example of an oem customer is their developing software

1046
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,535
So a lot of

1047
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,327
CAT scan for medical devices

1048
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,983
They're developing the software in the actual CAT scan device itself but all of that needs to run on a server

1049
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,031
Maybe it's very hard

1050
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,103
Operational environment high temperature dust

1051
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,175
Vibration and so we help them develop the platform

1052
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,479
Wanted days in any great into their solution

1053
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:04,319
Still put your logo on it and they sell it out to their customer as their insulin

1054
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,647
Okay and so how does your OEM division

1055
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,439
Really help those cost

1056
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,719
Get ahead

1057
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,791
We are really focus on first

1058
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,839
The it that they're developing is at

1059
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,215
And we help them surround that it with the right technology classes

1060
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,031
And we're drawing from all of Dell technology

1061
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:29,663
Two notches Deli and seeing Hardware but also VMware

1062
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:35,295
Everything that makes up Dell Technologies is part of the pallet that we can help a customer

1063
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:41,695
Paint your product picture front and so at the Dell Technologies level

1064
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,535
Hardware software Services program management engineering

1065
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,327
All of that together too

1066
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,167
Creating that new product based on their IP and our technology

1067
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,215
But that customer then takes the market

1068
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
Awesome

1069
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,519
So we're kin folks

1070
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543

Hardware store

1090
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:59,519
In-house expertise in software and the results is usually a lot of

1091
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,823
Put some apps that have a few download

1092
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,103
Square app store rating

1093
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,127

Device-based

1100
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,583
Feedback

1101
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,447
Gold generally has to make the digital interface

1102
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,519
More user-friendly and accessible more people

1103
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,823
And enjoy the benefits of smart home devices

1104
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:38,943
That is a lot of things to think about I will agree with you 100%

1105
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:42,015
Bad experiences from Hardware people

1106
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,319
In fact I feel like I have tried

1107
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,087
Couple devices

1108
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,879
Are awesome and

1109
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:50,719
15 spine or like you know what we're just going to do it cuz we don't even want to mess with

1110
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,303
I feel you on this

1111
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:58,655
I think it's probably hard how do you set this to someone do you just go up to the lake

1112
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,935
Illusion and say hey

1113
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,471
Your app is really tired

1114
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,359
I think a lot of

1115
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,151
Hardware Enterprises

1116
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,967
I understand that we're moving to a world where

1117
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
Every product

1118
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:17,343
I will be connected and they need to get to my cat's first with the best Schenectady

1119
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,927
And so a lot of these companies when we're talking with them

1120
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:27,327
We are cleaning out the things that can be done better and how we are providing

1121
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,119
A good user experience but

1122
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,703
Generally they see that mean

1123
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:38,591
They don't have available to develop

1124
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,151
And they know that focusing on both hardware and software

1125
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919
Chris Hart

1126
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:45,759
Digital first companies Commission

1127
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:52,159
Decipher gas card so generally they're excited about the opportunity to gift someone to support

1128
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,975
Which their mobile app so that they can focus on their heart or Friday

1129
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,511
I think sometimes though

1130
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,815
Bad Hardware also leads to poor apps

1131
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,399
So I'm sure that every time the nest app goes down

1132
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,959
Or the thermostat gets cut off from the cloud from

1133
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,495
Server issue

1134
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
I will take it out here

1135
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,127
But I thought it'd be great to talk to you given that you're

1136
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,431
Design-centric kind of thinking and

1137
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,503
We had a good conversation earlier about

1138
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,831
Where companies have gone wrong so far in selling the smart

1139
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:26,207
I think it's really interesting because we're in this place right now where we had all this hype and excitement and

1140
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,279
Power users coming in and kind of dictating the terms of

1141
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,047
A lot of apps

1142
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,119
And I'm not sure that that's really helping other people

1143
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,143
Adopt the smart

1144
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,679
So first talk to me about

1145
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,983
Where you see mainstream

1146
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
Adoption

1147
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,567
That's a great point because

1148
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
Right now

1149
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
I think

1150
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,127
And the biggest

1151
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,431
Change that is coming for smart

1152
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,991
Are getting cheaper and cheaper

1153
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,783
You know connected light bulb it's pretty much

1154
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,575
Cross the same as regular lights

1155
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,415
I'm going to start using some devices

1156
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,975
That means image option is going to challenge

1157
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,559
Up until now

1158
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:11,519
Complicated you exposed because they're going to be poking around until they find what they're looking for

1159
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,567
And sometimes even kind of enjoy

1160
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,591
Cracking

1161
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:20,479
That's not obvious problem mainstream users are not going to have that technical savviness for the patient

1162
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,295
Stop music smart home companies movie

1163
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
Need to get

1164
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,855
Much more user-friendly

1165
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,879
He said that audience

1166
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,415
Just being able to

1167
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,463
Show the benefits of the Nile

1168
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,487
Quickly

1169
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:37,887
The benefits of a connected device quickly it shouldn't take you that long to set up a device Paula shouldn't take you that long to

1170
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,679
Starting the key features in the eye

1171
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:43,519
What are some good design principles where do you think

1172
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,799
The focus of

1173
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,847
An app for lighting for example

1174
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,127
What time building I lighting

1175
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,919
Product what should I be looking for

1176
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:54,015
For I know that I and I'm kind of a power user but I'm also really lazy

1177
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
So I'm like

1178
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,319
What do I really want

1179
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,087
Out of my ass

1180
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:57,855
What do you think

1181
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:04,511
Yeah I think what we've seen is a lot of fact that are good at

1182
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:08,607
Leveraging intuitions that you could have built up from attracting but

1183
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,423
Provides for a better

1184
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:17,311
To turn on and off traditional light switch with dimmer at the laptop model that behavior

1185
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:23,711
Instead of inventing interface with users never-seen-before tend to be more intuitive a big thing for a smart

1186
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:29,599
Is that the most common use cases they're basically replacing a switch on the wall

1187
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:33,695
They need to be to make up most common interaction

1188
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:36,511
As simple as possible as simple as just like walking over

1189
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,535
New Orleans

1190
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,095
In flipping a switch

1191
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,679
Really easy to connect the life you wrote about how he did

1192
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:45,983
Wasn't

1193
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,591
Consumers

1194
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,615
About devices

1195
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:55,711
Setting up a wife caption require you to get familiar with the entire ecosystem

1196
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
Don't forget that

1197
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,759
Similarly

1198
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,039
I think that I'm boarding

1199
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
It's important

1200
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,367
Mobility 2

1201
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:08,511
Use the lights without much configuration siwa has done a good job in reading on thereafter

1202
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,279
Yes

1203
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,071
That's the one thing that you just really love

1204
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:14,399
Are default installation to start using and don't

1205
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,679
Need to do a lot of work

1206
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,471
On the flip side

1207
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:21,055
Surfacing the on-off switch on the home screen is really important

1208
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
Complain when

1209
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:26,687
They can't find Zora takes them a few clicks to get the on-off switch with a dimmer

1210
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,223
Make

1211
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,015
Purchasing additional light bulbs

1212
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
Myprovident

1213
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
The musician like

1214
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:36,671
Well that's cool and all but I've already bought one light bulb and I want to be able to control

1215
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,695
Before I buy additional

1216
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,047
Okay so let's break some of that down cuz some of its Universal like onboarding

1217
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:46,655
I feel like individual ecosystems are getting better about onboarding

1218
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,959
Like the busy way folks they have there

1219
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:53,311
I can't think of the name of it right now to get things online Amazon has an effort there

1220
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:59,711
If you buy a product from them it and automatically be linked to your existing Wi-Fi credentials if you have given them to it

1221
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,271
How do we make onboarding

1222
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,599
Easy especially for devices that may not have asked

1223
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:13,279
That's a good question anything cuz I'm waiting can be made easier by just making sure that the

1224
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,815
Letter sent out

1225
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,607
NBA Park clearly

1226
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,399
Defined a lot of apps

1227
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:23,007
I feel like they've always been designed for a difference

1228
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
Device

1229
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,079
Because it doesn't refer to

1230
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,127
The specific like what you're doing

1231
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895
Feels like

1232
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:33,247
A generalized interface design for any kind of connector

1233
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,527
The device

1234
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,319
Just covering all the different bases

1235
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,855
Wedding expectation

1236
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,647
Clearly

1237
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,927
This could be

1238
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,951
Much clearer

1239
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,743
Sometimes you don't need to have that many

1240
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,023
That's another

1241
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,351
If something goes wrong for you

1242
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,143
But if make me feel like you're done pumping

1243
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:53,727
On the flip side it could be like sisters

1244
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,287
Actually something that the user could do differently in

1245
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:00,127
Then they should be there and it should be very clear

1246
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:05,503
Could be improved by making sure that

1247
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:08,831
Clear concise language that applies specifically to

1248
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:12,159
Yes I have had mystery error messages

1249
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,719
Let's talk about the business

1250
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,999
Ecosystem that you're into

1251
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,279
Because

1252
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,071
It honestly feels to me

1253
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:22,143
Like designing a nap it feels like maybe a

1254
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,703
Feature not necessarily a full-on product

1255
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:28,799
For a company if I'm like Whirlpool I'm already talking to

1256
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:33,663
A2 yarndale are some other company to provide my cloud back in baby I've got

1257
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:36,223
Another company doing my business Analytics

1258
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,759
Now I bring you into

1259
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,039
Make my app

1260
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:39,807
App for

1261
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
Consumers

1262
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,879
How do you see that evolving

1263
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,695
I think a lot of

1264
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,743
The platforms that are customers

1265
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,511
Already

1266
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,279
Used today

1267
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:52,351
We do work alongside the existing system

1268
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,887
Babcock McCallum place

1269
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,935
More often those are especially system

1270
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,471
Since that are supporting product

1271
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,495
Caribbean Market

1272
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,031
Cancel our goal is

1273
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:00,799
To help

1274
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,335
Customers with upgrade

1275
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,895
Give experience

1276
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,967
One half of the experience that they're offering their own music

1277
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,087
The device connect

1278
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,879
Smart's from dealership

1279
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:22,047
Plugging into the the system that they haven't placed with their working

1280
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,583
Already are working with

1281
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
Sun platform

1282
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:29,471
We're offering them a partial solution so that they can continue working with the it's our job

1283
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,239
To help them with

1284
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,799
Customer experience

1285
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,847
Not to make restricted

1286
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,639
Technology or platform recommendation

1287
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,711
If I'm a company trying to

1288
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:43,295
Look at this and like I asked you know I feel like I can build an app

1289
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,575
What else do you guys

1290
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,343
Offer

The

1295

Square both IOS and Android

1296
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,471
And then we have cloud services

1297
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,519
Support those apps will think about that

1298
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,799
Like push notification

1303
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:21,439
And also machine learning analysis of quote the review

1304
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,743
The book where the specific

1305
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,839
And also other apps in the same category when looking at how are you there

1306
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,607
Responding to

1307
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,911

Batman

1309
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:40,127
Makes a ton of sense and I assume you guys also will update the app

1310
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:40,895
Overtime

1311
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,943
And do you handle things like

1312
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,271
Don't know security vulnerabilities and thinking about like how to patch that

1313
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,807
Yeah

1314
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,159
We definitely are offering include regular updates to be

1315
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,439
Any kind of

1316
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:57,023
Regular things that happened across the board like a new operating system

1317
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,839
Specifically for security though

1318
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,119
We obviously

1319
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,911
Follow all of the best practices

1320
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,447
Data

1321
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:10,847
Interested in a trust anonymizing analytic data requesting granular permissions in the butt

1322
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:14,943
Makes classical unique is that we leverage our economies

1323
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,223
Yogurt to build

1324
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,319
Picture features one and then share that functionality with all the apps

1325
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,695
Picture apps that when you're starting from scratch

1326
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,231
You really need to

1327
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,511
Toyota 7-seater

1328
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:33,119
In that context it's really easy to understand why so many

1329
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,679
Have struck a bad balance when it comes

1330
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,447
Security

1331
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,751
What you get

1332
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,055
You're the best experience baidu

1333
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:44,127
Does your Apple benefits from something like

1334
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,919
Two-factor off you'll have that from

1335
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,687
The one

1336
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,247
And it's basically like a no-cost decision

1337
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,807
That is related

1338
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:58,207
Setting so I think that level of is kind of like standardization or expertise in this area I think is really important

1339
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,047
Ye all right

1340
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,839
Can you talk about any of your customer

1341
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,631
Quick question

1342
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:12,031
Cancel

1343
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,103
But what I can say is

1344
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,663
Collaborating with around a dozen of the biggest

1345
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,687
Household.

1346
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,479
To help them with

1347
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:23,039
For things like my thermostat

1348
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:29,439
Various home appliances Fortune 500 company

1349
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,743
Established in the traditional

1350
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,047
Hardware device Beijing

1351
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:39,423
At some point in their digital transformation Journey but it's also kind of some devices he's talked about.

1352
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:44,799
Early on

1353
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,335
You were formed this year

1354
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,359
Have you raised any fun

1355
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:54,271
We are backed by y combinator Argo obviously has to be a a b c

1356
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:58,111
Currently funded by, but I think there's a big

1357
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:02,719
In a way. Operating as an agency or developing

1358
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:04,511
My shop wouldn't allow us to cheat with

1359
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,071
It's crucial for us to be ABC.

1360
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:12,959
So it doesn't seem like a super scalable business bottle though it does seem more like an agency business model

1361
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,751
So how do you plan to make that way

1362
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,031
Work for adventure

1363
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,335
The way we work as bait

1364
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:23,199
Traditional agency model we start from a

1365
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:25,759
Aux flow that is optimized

1366
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:30,111
For the best music experience in a particular category like light for thermostat

1367
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,183
And then we add additional support for distinct features

1368
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:33,951
In

1369
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,975
And the customers

1370
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,743
Hardware

1371
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:42,143
And then we apply visual identity and branding on top of that which means that we are actually building these.

1372
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,447
Got it awesome

1373
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,239
