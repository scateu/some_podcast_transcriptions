00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,808
World's going to keep

8
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,832
On the Apple topic

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,136
By discussing their damage in the house

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
Healthcare Market

11
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,208
Netgear is taking part of Arlo public

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,864
We got some news on Canary Amazon Intel and Sonos Kevin's going to tell you

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,632
A little bit

14
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,912
About his WeMo

15
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,984
Rich and have a message from our sponsor Point Central

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,568
And our guest is Bruce Chatterley's CEO of

17
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
Set it

18
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,872
He's going to talk to us about

19
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,640
Laura

20
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
And Laura net worth

21
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,224
Lyrics We got some use cases

22
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,296
Some crazy functionality that I didn't

23
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,576
Actually know Laura had

24
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,624
So before we get into all of this

25
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648
Let's get a message

26
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,672
Witch from another one

27
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,816
Building an iot device or solution start ahead with a Renee sauce energy

28
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,216
Begin your iot device designs at the software API later and leave the details to renaisa

29
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,824
Cloud-based iot Solutions quickly with the AE Cloud 1 kit

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
Amazon web services Microsoft Azure Google cloud or your choice of cloud within minutes

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
We're loaded time get 50% off the AE Cloud 1 kit look for the Renee sauce iot

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,024
The sandbox discussion thread on the Renee sauce rules for a go to Stacey on iot. Com

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,424
Splash cloudkit to be forwarded to the discussion thread and get your coupon that Stacey on iot

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
Jd.com

35
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
Cloudkit

36
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
I believe we should start

37
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
Most exciting

38
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
For us which is Mozilla

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
Coyote

40
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
Gateway South

41
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,224
This

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,552
I was excited I know for many of our listeners

43
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
This is probably right up your alley

44
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,696
Because you guys are the ones who tell me about homebridge and openhab and all the stuff in this

45
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,280
It's right here within that kind of thing although it looks a little easier

46
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:14,144
Yeah I'm super excited as well this was announced last year this is the project

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,472
Things effort from Mozilla

48
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,848
To allow you to have your own Gateway your own iot device Gateway in your home

49
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,200
Using Raspberry Pi with mid they may support other pieces of Hardware in the future

50
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,040
And they're giving every device in your home

51
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,112
Are URL and you're going to be using a web app

52
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:39,232
To control everything through the Gateway so this is definitely a DIY project and

53
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,280
Stacy you and I I know I am

54
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Yes

55
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
He's really experienced

56
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
I totaled

57
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
We can't even get started

58
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,640
Yet though because what we could but

59
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
It be limited you can start today with a pie and the download from Mozilla to get your things Gateway go away

60
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:09,184
We are waiting on some Z-Wave dongles USB dongles

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,232
To control Z-Wave devices

62
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:16,864
So would I not starting until that gets here at all if you're going to jump the gun and try and play with us earlier

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
I didn't have a spare

64
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,216
Hi-so actually end

65
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
Z-Wave

66
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
Dongle

67
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,176
You're doing this it's worth noting that you have to do it for

68
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
Your country

69
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
Frequencies for four different around the

70
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
And you also need to

71
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
Make sure it has Z-Wave

72
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,392
Plus which is the latest iteration

73
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,232
It is probably worth mentioning there's a Wiki

74
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,584
Of supported Hardware that Mozilla is keeping track of their a couple of Z-Wave dongles

75
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
And aside from the point that you just made Stacy about

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
What you need to look out for the

77
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
Aeon Tac is that the right one

78
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,592
That's the only got I'm part of the reason that I would have gotten this one anyway

79
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,992
One thing I seem to have massive amounts of wireless range and second-rate have a built-in battery

80
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:11,392
So we can run for I think it said forecast 15 days if it needed to if you if you want plugged-in I guess maybe you're running your pie

81
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
High on the battery I don't know it's

82
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,280
Rather interesting how it all works but

83
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
The pie plugged in

84
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
That makes sense because

85
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,239
Perry on Z-Wave sometimes works really really much

86
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,287
Better when you're right next to the device

87
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
Yes no I'm not sure

88
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
I guess it's you

89
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
Is the pairing of the radios

90
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
Exactly

91
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
I seem like a cool feature

92
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
And I have tons

93
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
A lot of them are

94
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,487
Installed so this is actually nice

95
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,071
I can't move my door locks I mean I could but that would be

96
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
Uninstall

97
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,703
Actually my Hub to the door lock just temporarily just two

98
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Outback

99
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
Yeah but

100
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:07,199
Anyway so this is all like a small web-based interface

101
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,991
Yet I don't know if there will be

102
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
So like

103
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:16,671
I think my sim is going to go nuts myself using this website which is like a dedicated URL from my Gateway

104
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,487
A my house as opposed to say the Wink app

105
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,791
Don't tell just have to do with I suppose

106
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,375
Dietitian

107
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,983
The ideas you program all your automation so the goal is never to touch

108
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
The app

109
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
It is truly supposed to be

110
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Morada

111
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,127
So you set up your rules and such

112
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Pull out

113
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,967
As many sensors is you

114
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
Can find because you're going to want

115
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
Let It Go

116
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
I also

117
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,559
Yeah whatever it's a mish-mosh over here just like

118
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:59,167
Just like you have I'll probably just put a couple devices on this for testing purposes that way

119
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
I can learn I can explain

120
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:07,359
Here on the show and then my family doesn't go nuts with the devices that use all the time cuz you can go hog-wild with this thing there's even a floor plan

121
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:13,759
10 piece of the app where you can kind of figure out where drag-and-drop where you're going to put things in a rather interesting

122
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
But again my family does not

123
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
I care about that stuff

124
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,623
And for all of you guys who are excited about

125
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,415
Control

126
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,975
That's what this offers and that makes sense

127
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:30,143
It's not going to change the fact that your devices are still going

128
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
You're seawave devices.

129
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Don't necessarily

130
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:36,543
But you know this is so

131
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
What word nut

132
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,639
Over here at the iot podcast

133
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Is the

134
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
Homepod

135
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,967
So reviews are out

136
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
We are still getting one

137
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,319
Kevin has one on order and it should arrive

138
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
This Friday

139
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
That's correct

140
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,439
So next week we'll talk about our experience with

141
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
Hybrid Mean Time

142
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
Looks like people

143
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
People thought it sounded great

144
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
And it wasn't a small

145
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
What we expected

146
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
And I said

147
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,263
Yeah I mean I was hoping to be wrong

148
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,079
But there's still a lot of

149
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
I don't want to say

150
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,407
It seems that the smart part of it

151
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,039
Apple really wants to be focused on the speaker side they are smart speakers it's smart

152
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
Technology they're using for the audio piece

153
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Thanks

154
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,183
If you think about it with the beamforming and auto-tuning and

155
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:30,303
Constant changing of your listen to the music so that we can adjust on the Fly and smoke

156
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
I get that that's

157
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Rather

158
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Smart

159
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,471
Services for our listeners the smart as in smart home

160
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
Smart devices

161
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
That's

162
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,823
Sorely lacking faculty

163
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,223
Siri on the phone and tablet is actually smarter than Siri on the home but they're still

164
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,295
A lot of limitations there's no voice recognition in terms of

165
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
Multiple users

166
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,671
Couldn't see you calendars I mean

167
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,023
Things that just couldn't do sure you can control homekit devices

168
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
Yeah

169
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,399
Shut off your routine

170
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
Which

171
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
You know this is

172
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
Be smart speakers

173
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
In my life

174
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
How much more of a digital assistant

175
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
And it does things

176
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Ranging from

177
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,919
What's the recipe for this drink

178
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
2

179
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,735
Drop it on my kid

180
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
2

181
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
Call me an Uber

182
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,879
I really I really value that

183
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,231
Do you I know you do rely heavily on the digital assistant with

184
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Voice control on such

185
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
Do you ever set timers

186
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
I'm sure you do

187
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,495
Do you ever sit too at the same time would like when cooking

188
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,543
HEI set a rice timer and then I'll set

189
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Broccoli timer

190
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,407
And that was one of the things that a couple of reviewers

191
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,247
She can't Siri can't do two timers on the homepod

192
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
Oh

193
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
I mean

194
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,207
It's like it's like a toned-down version of Siri which

195
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,767
I don't understand why that is there's an A8

196
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
Chip processor

197
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
I think that was in the iPhone

198
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,143
XR7

199
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
It's more than capable

200
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
Doing this type of request

201
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
And having a smart sand

202
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
Why is it like I sub Siri

203
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,847
In thumb part of my question

204
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
Maybe it'll get better

205
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Country

206
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
Apple said that they were working on this

207
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
For 6 years however

208
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,159
And I think most of the focus was on the sound

209
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,743
That just understand why they couldn't take what they currently have for Siri

210
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,279
Sarpullido burlesque

211
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Wants to share that with

212
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,983
Are confused

213
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Of Apple

214
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,567
Let's talk about some place they're doing well which is

215
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Healthcare

216
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,943
I think there's a lot to like here so I just saw story this week

217
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
About

218
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
Is 4

219
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,831
Group called cardiogram and they did a study called

220
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
It's part of the deep heart study

221
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Cardiogram

222
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
UCSF

223
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
But

224
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,047
This one says we Apple watch can detect diabetes with an 85%

225
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
Accuracy

226
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
I thought that was

227
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
Beijing

228
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
They've already been shown to

229
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,983
Detect abnormal heart rhythms with 97%

230
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,055
Accuracy sleep apnea with 90% accuracy

231
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
And even hypertension

232
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
So in this is using

233
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Cardiograms ail

234
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
So

235
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
It's using the date of honey

236
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Watch to run

237
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,415
Reading that data is the resting heart rate and heart rate variability which is the metric they added

238
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
With the latest

239
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
Version of

240
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
Watch it was if I recall correctly so

241
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:46,655
Caring the data for the two of those is what's giving them the insight as to who may have diabetes

242
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
And I think that's

243
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,471
Awesome I think

244
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,031
What apple is do in healthcare

245
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
Is pretty impressive

246
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,199
Its reputation for privacy and making the consumer experience

247
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,503
Easier I think is really going to

248
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
Gwen in this market

249
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,159
Frustration is you cannot win in this market unless you buy

250
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
Crazy expensive

251
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
Watch in a

252
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
Crazy expensive phone

253
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Can you buy into

254
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:19,167
Ecosystem that's definitely true there are some companies and stores that have looked at giving Apple

255
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,567
Watches to the customers and so on so you may not have to spend the money at least not upfront maybe party or premium who knows

256
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
No argument there

257
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,735
I have to say I remember going to the Apple event where they launched a Apple watch

258
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,319
And I think I went to another one where they upgraded it

259
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,159
Which was most impressed with the health kit

260
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
Information

261
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,255
As opposed to the hardware and software the Apple watch itself

262
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
The amount of data that they are

263
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,399
Wrangling properly I would say it's on studies such as the one you just mention

264
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
Is mind-blowing

265
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,239
It really is a lot of other companies that make

266
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,055
Devices wearable devices I can do this kind of stuff too

267
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
Apple seems to have

268
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,175
Beyblade do more with that data working with its medical partners

269
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
And

270
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
As an example of this

271
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,271
Actually just in January

272
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,343
They did an update to iOS 11

273
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
3 lets people see their medical

274
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
Records

275
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,279
That is amazing and they work with Johns Hopkins

276
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Cedars-Sinai pain

277
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
Hospitals

278
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,167
To get those records in for their

279
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
The patients in

280
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,751
You know I don't know

281
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
S i a Gemini

282
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,103
Holy cow I forgotten so many aspects of

283
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Overtime that

284
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
And so

285
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,807
I would love to have this cuz right now my health records are all basically in an epic system

286
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Locked away

287
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
Like 20 different.

288
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Offices

289
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:52,095
Same here and I don't know that any other big company any of Apple's competitors lesao

290
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,423
Google Microsoft or Amazon

291
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
Have the

292
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
What's called the

293
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,055
Approach to privacy that would allow

294
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
Healthcare professionals to work with them

295
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,199
Because obviously Healthcare data is very private we have laws on that here I'm sure there

296
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
Elsewhere as well

297
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,015
So I think they've got a big

298
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,879
Advantage here with that and speaking of health records one of the things that I recently did was

299
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
I told my family they all have iPhones

300
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,023
Go put everything in your medical ID card

301
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,351
For your Apple Health app on your phone all the medications are taken

302
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,911
Something happens to you I don't know what you

303
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
You taking I don't know all your allergies and what not

304
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,567
And that's all accessible right through the medical ID part of Apple health so I have them do that

305
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:38,687
Again there's other apps that will do this as well but into Apple health and what they're doing here

306
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,503
Man if you could just print that out that would save you so much time when

307
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
On your first docker

308
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,207
So yes I think apple has a

309
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,303
Huge Advantage here and I actually I wonder as I get older

310
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,143
If I would invest in the ecosystem simply for the health

311
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
That's right or the health app

312
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
As much as I dislike

313
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
Constrained closed Apple world

314
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
I got to say

315
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
4Health it makes sense

316
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
If only it were cheaper

317
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
All right

318
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
Let's talk about

319
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
Arlo Netgear

320
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
This week announced

321
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,391
Its board has approved the separation of its are Lucic

322
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
Camera

323
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
Into except

324
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Business

325
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,559
And it's going to offer an initial public offering

326
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,863
A shares in Arlo Technologies

327
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
It is going to issue less

328
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
20% of its common stock and IPOs so

329
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
Netgear still going to have it

330
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Pretty powerful

331
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Shakiness

332
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
I got to be honest

333
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
I don't know if I buy it at

334
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
It doesn't feel like a

335
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
Picking up business

336
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
Terry Lee

337
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,039
And IPO to be a standalone business is kind

338
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
There's the cameras

339
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
And then there's

340
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,463
Subscription offering so it's kind of an interesting business model

341
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
I just

342
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,047
I don't love that it's mostly Hardware

343
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
So I guess I'm just kind of like

344
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,935
I kind of feel the same way I'd say if that unit is

345
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,471
Profitable or has

346
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
Great Expectations keep it in-house you're still going to have it work with your other networking Year anyway

347
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,919
I'm not sure why they're doing this

348
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,735
I mean I look at it as hey if I was Netgear

349
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:21,087
X number years ago I figure hey there going to be a router or two and every house let's see no

350
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,183
And now I'm going to be multiple cameras in every house

351
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,095
Is that a whole business by itself does it need to be myself I'm not sure why they feel the need to do this

352
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,655
Money money money money I will say

353
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
With Amazon

354
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,775
Launch of like the wise camera

355
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
Knickers

356
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,871
Offering their own connect

357
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
2 cameras

358
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,223
Is a highly saturated market so maybe they just want to get a capital

359
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,247
Infusion to do something

360
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,551
Cool what that cool thing is I

361
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
I don't know

362
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,671
So that's our financial advice for the

363
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Arlo

364
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
Now for the rapid

365
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
Here we go

366
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
First step

367
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Speaking of

368
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:12,287
Camera scanner just rolled out their person detection algorithms that they announced several months ago

369
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,431
My canary devices were updated just happens automatically

370
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,247
Interessant they're going to roll this out over the next two weeks

371
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
There's nothing that users need to do

372
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
And this is really good I think

373
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:30,463
I get pictures and notifications of my dog all day long running around the house and I don't really care about that

374
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,863
Partially because I'm home as well

375
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,167
Moving around so this does exactly that

376
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,007
A little Pro tip if you want to enable this and only see people

377
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,079
Set your sensitivity on the notifications

378
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
Or emotion

379
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
3 or less

380
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:53,759
Unfortunate cut out all the cute pictures of my dog but really that's what you want for personification

381
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Got it

382
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,111
What's the Super Bowl last on Amazon

383
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,671
The echo commercial and

384
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,719
How when you set my demise name

385
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
On the TV

386
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Is she did not respond

387
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,863
And the reason is because Amazon is doing a little in audible tone

388
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Before

389
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
Saying her name

390
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
So it doesn't actually activate

391
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
I wish we could

392
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,335
I wish we could use that tone for the show

393
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
Meet

394
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,175
Padme is kind of an awkward thing

395
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Plus

396
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,039
Now I kind of think about that way and so sometimes

397
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
Yeah that's not her name

398
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,463
Maybe hey anyone at Amazon how can we get one of these

399
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,047
And speaking of Amazon are filed a patent

400
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:42,911
For a wristband that tracks workers movement so they can make sure that they are

401
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Performing

402
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
I guess

403
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Appropriate level

404
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:53,407
I don't know I meant they already have carts that they push around that track how far they walk in salon but

405
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:57,247
What Amazon could do is make sure the people are in the right spot for the right products

406
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Naked

407
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,855
See perhaps somebody's working too hard by the heart rate there's a lot of things they could do

408
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,183
In a warehouse

409
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,255
People on construction sites who actually want to measure the

410
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,535
Vital signs

411
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
Workers so if they're dehydrated

412
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
Can tell him to go

413
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
So it's not all

414
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,751
Work faster or else a few but it is probably the most productivity out of a person by

415
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,591
I totally digitizing a reading all the signals that they can be like oh

416
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,895
This person is not as productive because they are

417
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
They're thirsty

418
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
Quick

419
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,015
It could even be safety I mean what's a pallet full of

420
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,063
I don't know Apple watches fall on somebody

421
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,623
You know their heart rates going to spike big time

422
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
There's a lot of

423
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
A lot of aspects

424
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,487
Yeah and I've actually so there's a company

425
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
That was called

426
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Clue

427
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,583
The software on Apple watches that can

428
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,887
They actually use it for weight loss

429
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,935
Food tracking so attracts

430
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,495
Your motions of your wrists they can discern between

431
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
Glass of water

432
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,079
Or holding a wine glass

433
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,895
And they use that to say hey this is how

434
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
How many calories are consumed

435
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,271
This is why I drink my wine out of water glasses

436
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,647
I was talking to someone in the restaurant industry

437
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:12,255
You can actually use something like that to see if your workers are

438
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
Performing like chopping

439
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Pink skirt

440
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,143
And I could be like a very good education

441
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
Feedback

442
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
Watch vibrate

443
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
When you're not doing it

444
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
So

445
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,055
The flipside is all of that data can also be a

446
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,127
I think I said when I talked about it on the show I was like

447
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,687
How you can tell if I was going to slap in my kid around

448
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
That's probably something

449
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
The people would want

450
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,599
But once you have this information you can apply

451
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
All kinds of algorithms to it to determine

452
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,487
Oh my God is that person picking their nose or are they drinking a glass of wine

453
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Yikes

454
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
Okay

455
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,167
That I lied to you

456
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
You know me

457
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
That software that we constantly

458
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Play talk about

459
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
We have been lately

460
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
They have announced

461
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,591
Native integration

462
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,943
With Sonos which means there are third-party integration that all the you know me

463
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
People have known and loved

464
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,271
It's going to go away and with it

465
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
This is sad

466
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,111
Is the text-to-speech announcement

467
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,671
So I at one point in time cuz I was silly

468
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
We had my you know

469
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
When I came

470
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,023
And

471
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
So that's going to go away

472
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:31,103
Which Native Integrations tend to be better anyway

473
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,151
Man middleware etcetera

474
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:39,807
Which makes me wonder about that you know me is the string of size and someone eventually is more Partners get made

475
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,623
Giving equations to the resistance what happens to these things

476
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
Like what

477
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
Middle players

478
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:50,047
I think they still have a good role to play as an energy

479
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:54,911
Greater so like I do routines through these things that I could not otherwise do

480
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
Through the Amazon

481
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,519
Or the Google

482
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
True

483
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
But you're right I don't know what happens to them

484
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,943
And you know he has an entirely different business on the backend so

485
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,247
And stringify is now part of Comcast

486
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
Belle Delphine

487
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
All right and now it's time for Kevin

488
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,696
Review of

489
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,280
Changing my 7 word review

490
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,328
WeMo Bridge

491
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
It's a bridge

492
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
Portofino

493
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,936
More information

494
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,336
I can expand upon that I did write this up over at Stacy and I were too.

495
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
Calm so you can

496
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
Read my thoughts

497
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,920
This is a $40

498
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:41,760
Bridge device that adds homekit support for WeMo devices

499
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,576
Not all of them very important that you realized

500
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:48,672
WeMo bulbs will not be added or supported by this

501
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
So if you have Outlets

502
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
Or switches

503
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,816
Go by Wiimote anyone integrate those into your home app

504
00:21:55,328 --> 00:22:00,192
On iOS devices and Siri to control them this will do that just not for the bulbs

505
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
It does work very well

506
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
It took me all of

507
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:09,152
3 minutes to set up and get working at fantastic one of the things I'm not a fan of and this is a personal preference

508
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
I'm not trying to

509
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
Say this applies to everybody

510
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,504
It does require a wider

511
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,112
Connection to your network so you need to have an open ethernet port and also requires

512
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,440
Power on a sew-in so you need a power outlet near it

513
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,744
This is why I like wireless devices

514
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
But that's just me

515
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
I don't have a lot of ports on my router

516
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:33,472
If you can live with those two things and really need Siri and or home support

517
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,032
We're spending if you've got a lot of WeMo devices

518
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,104
I'm fine just using that Ma and Google for August

519
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,944
Steelworks and cancer

520
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:49,600
I will probably just kind of takis off my network as a result I don't need it on homekit but it's really really

521
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
And

522
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
If you are sad

523
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
May I recommend my favorite

524
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,400
Switch which I have all over my house is

525
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
It's 25 bucks

526
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
And

527
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
I have three of them

528
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
For possibly more

529
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,824
Read out I don't know how many I have

530
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,640
I have many ports

531
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,736
So if you're out there it's not

532
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
Proposition

533
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Switch to your home

534
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,624
Okay this is someone

535
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:28,256
And after we recorded most the show but we thought was worth

536
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Canon

537
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,352
And we're talking about

538
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,888
Nest

539
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
Google alphabet Zoo

540
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
Absorb

541
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,800
All right so what happened is

542
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:46,688
Fiscally today set the nest

543
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,736
Into the

544
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
Started

545
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
Where it

546
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
No it didn't start with perfect

547
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,648
Is purchased by

548
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
20

549
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,256
14 / 3.2

550
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,304
And after

551
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,608
4 years of

552
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,936
Not much excitement the nest

553
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,032
We saw three directions of the nest we saw more iterations of the

554
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,872
Nest cam what used to be Dropcam which was a complete for purchase

555
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
That was

556
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
Actually nothing St

557
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
After that

558
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,808
Spawn that all out

559
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,392
The point is Google bringing this

560
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,000
They're saying it's because they want to take advantage of

561
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,304
Infrastructure that Google

562
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,888
Kevin

563
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
Esketit

564
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,032
Well if that were true that would indicate they didn't have access to Google

565
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:49,408
MLA I Envision recognition which I find that very hard to believe

566
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Took advantage of

567
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:58,624
Exactly so would the reasons for this be publicly Spoken Reasons by the executives

568
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,672
Ring a little Hollow to me person

569
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:07,328
See this is alphabet / Google trying to save face here because let's be honest message

570
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,352
Pretty stagnant

571
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,632
I would say

572
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:16,032
What the headlines you said the tree decorations of the nest thermostat they had the Dropcam purchase which became Nest cams

573
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,104
And they have since out of the nest security system

574
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,176
Toward the tail end of 2017

575
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,712
Other than that

576
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
They do have the nest for

577
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
We cannot forget this

578
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,808
Smoke alarm

579
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
Was

580
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
Not as awesome

581
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
Initially wanted

582
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,208
Which is actually a good tagline

583
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,024
I think nest + Tony fadell came on

584
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
With this vision for the Smart Home

585
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,656
Really was awesome and very compelling a very intuitive Smart Home

586
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,496
And the fact of the matter is it's very hard to build something

587
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
With

588
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,592
Not being able to control every single device

589
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,272
Yeah but I would say I would say this I personally have a lot of faith in Rick osterloh who was

590
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,600
Charge of some Hardware at Motorola

591
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:06,208
Both prior to and when Google actually on the road

592
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,744
Then they brought

593
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
He's in charge of Google's Hardware

594
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,584
And between the pixel slate

595
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,888
And the pixelbook

596
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,192
The purchase will not purchase

597
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,264
About the hiring of about 2000 HTC employees

598
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
What's more likely for the phone group

599
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Oscar Lopez

600
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:28,224
Could the right person to be in charge of Hardware that's where the existing person

601
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
He will report to Rick osterloh

602
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,808
Kinesio marwen

603
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
The wise

604
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
Will report to

605
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
Rick osterloh

606
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,672
Yes and

607
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Actually

608
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:39,744
For the Telecom

609
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
2sao

610
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
These guys

611
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
Is recent past correct

612
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
So this is

613
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
Yeah

614
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,656
This is a face-saving

615
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,216
You can't idea was basically they were going to have

616
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
Beaver sell nest

617
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
And

618
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,544
Or spit it back in

619
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,872
I would also say for companies that are

620
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:00,736
Ring searching for evaluation right now it's part of their fundraising up a billion dollars and

621
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
Netgear

622
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,296
As we talked about earlier

623
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
Doing the Arlo

624
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
IPO

625
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,160
I think this is actually bad news for like

626
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
Harbor players

627
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
I think

628
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:17,376
Yeah I mean with the right strategy and mean if I spend up make sense and spin-off make sense to spin-off just for the sake

629
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:21,728
Lakers raising money and so on I'm not so sure that that's going to fly long-term

630
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:26,080
I will be very curious to see if going back to the first thing I said if nest

631
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:31,200
Continues to stagnate I'm hoping not I'm hoping now that Google

632
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,736
Pushes the product

633
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
Rideout

634
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
And to be honest there's a lot of

635
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,416
Google partners that can do some of the same stuff that you think I could do

636
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Because they

637
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:46,048
Partner on Android

638
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,376
I would love to see

639
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
Could be pushed to do

640
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:55,264
I would love to see presents because I don't think anybody does that well in the home

641
00:27:55,776 --> 00:28:00,128
And be honest well anyone could do it this way I'm thinking Google could do it through Bluetooth

642
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,176
Which almost like a Tracker

643
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,224
Which Bluetooth

644
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,624
Device are you closest to in your house whether it's a Bluetooth thing you're wearing in on a Android Wear watch

645
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:17,024
If you have all these Google homes and Nest products around which one are you closest to and I can start putting more context around that present

646
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
That's what I'm going to say

647
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,912
Yes eyes Kevin and I both said we think that the Value Inn

648
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:29,568
Big influence as it were in the smart home is

649
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:34,432
Google home and Google Assistant

650
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
The question is really

651
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
How does nest

652
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,296
How does Nest Hardware fit into that

653
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,832
Catfishing

654
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
Presences

655
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
End

656
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,488
Maybe they could

657
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,304
Outlets would be a way to get presents but

658
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
Who needs another Outlet light switches

659
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,168
I like your Bluetooth

660
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,704
I should also

661
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,240
According to CNET

662
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
In an interview they did

663
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
Is part of the snooze

664
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,128
Nestle sold 11 million devices which

665
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,664
I actually think it's a little low

666
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,456
I would agree with you

667
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
Compared to

668
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,552
You know the Amazon Echo which is really like

669
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,112
The chiller killer

670
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
I don't know I'm

671
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:23,328
After all this time I would agree with you

672
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,984
Maybe they can actually drive the price down for

673
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,032
These devices Fitness high prices are

674
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:39,200
They're challenged I would agree with that and if you're working in one Hardware division where you can manage the supply chain from one point of presence

675
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
I think you're right that can help

676
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,552
So what do you think

677
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,392
Set the nest brand which obviously makes sense to keep the nest brand right now

678
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,416
Eating at last

679
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,720
So cuz I'm not so sure it doesn't

680
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
I'd like it as a brand

681
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,120
It conveys all kinds of things

682
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
Google

683
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,680
Haji does it do

684
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:03,008
Right so Google Assistant

685
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,800
Connecting with consumers problem

686
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,104
I would love to see Nest help

687
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,968
So I hope the brand stays and they actually invest in

688
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,552
Mean things a little more consumer-friendly cuz that has been

689
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
A nice aspect

690
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
It is very

691
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:24,512
I'm going to play Devil's Advocate and I don't know which of us is going

692
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:29,888
As a brand last for maybe 18 or 24 months and they just become part of the Google home brand

693
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,360
All right we shall see 18 months from now

694
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,176
And whoever wins gets

695
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
All right

696
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Well

697
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,856
That's it for this little

698
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,648
News on our thing 2nd and

699
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416

According to me like a kingdom

We haven't talked yet

00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
It's going to involve

740
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,648
Psychic powers on behalf

741
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,672
The person you're trying

742
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,208
Call or who's trying to call you

743
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,560
First off you have to name all of your Amazon echos

744
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,120
Thanks so pretty

745
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
My daughter

746
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,496
Anna original

747
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
My husband and I

748
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
10 to

749
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,616
Banana as opposed to drop in on Amazon

750
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,456
Anna's room

751
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
Right

752
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,016
Yes

753
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:54,784
I change that

754
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,880
So every room of your house should have every Echo should have a

755
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
And then

756
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,440
When someone wants to

757
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,256
They actually have

758
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
To call you

759
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:06,816
And that's the second

760
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
Well

761
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,888
I would agree with you but

762
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
ICU

763
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
Could

764
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,960
Could be

765
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,800
A little less psychic because there are settings in The Madam a app

766
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:22,176
That allows you to a have drop-in supported work being not supported

767
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:28,064
And also their setting for only my household so if you don't want space if you don't want me dropping in

768
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
To your house on

769
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,672
Anna you could just say only my household for Anna's room

770
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,768
It's in the settings of the device

771
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,864
She have to go into each individual device and then down towards the bottom

772
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,656
Under General there's a drop in

773
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
Setting

774
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,520
Oh okay so this is where you would go anyway to change

775
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,824
That is correct same tap yes

776
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
So

777
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
I'm doing that

778
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,688
Yes

779
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
So drop in

780
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,808
But you can say only my household

781
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,880
Utah P if I do

782
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,952
Course I'm right I'm looking at the screen

783
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,536
So now I am too so I totally believe you okay

784
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,608
So that may help Sam a little bit

785
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,912
I kind of choosing which

786
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,472
Echo devices you would accept

787
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,520
Outside drop in calls from

788
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,104
Send me

789
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,152
Heaven

790
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
On my living

791
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,248
Amazon Echo Show

792
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,320
Oh but that has a video camera

793
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
This is true

794
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,464
Very fun

795
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,512
Okay so I hope that helps

796
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,304
And if it doesn't help

797
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
Carlos Bacca

798
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
All right

799
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,192
Remember if you would like us to answer your

800
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
Questions

801
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
60

802
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
742

803
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,360
Stay tuned for our guest

804
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,664
Bruce Charlie CEO of Senate

805
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
Talking about

806
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
Specifically Laura roaming and

807
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
Pretty fun use cases

808
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:07,648
Stop before that let's go to a message from our sponsor

809
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:14,048
Hey everyone we're taking a break from this week's podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is

810
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,632
President

811
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,448
So let's get started with what

812
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
Display Central do

813
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
Pointcentral is

814
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:28,896
City of alarm.com and we are the leading provider of enterprise-grade home automation Solutions as a business tool

815
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,736
Too short and long-term managers of single-family and multi-family property

816
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,784
So let's talk about the property manager

817
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
Why are they into

818
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
Home automation

819
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,392
Today's property managers have a

820
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:46,048
Presidents that have needs always trying to find people to rent on TalkBack homes or trying to manage and turn those

821
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:52,448
Homes especially as possible and Technologies really starting to emerge as a tool that can use it points to improve

822
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,984
Presidents and how they run their business

823
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
The two buckets

824
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,032
DC property managers

825
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,872
See benefits from home automation in operational efficiency

826
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,664
Is an asset protection

827
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,688
As well as

828
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
Asset enhancement

829
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
Okay so tell me about those

830
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,808
Grape from the acid enhancement

831
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,624
Point of view we touched on this a little bit last week

832
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
What really helps

833
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,952
Turn the acid from a rental unit

834
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,488
Into a home for the resident

835
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:19,328
Because it brings this technology into their lives and it's easy and accessible way

836
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:24,192
From an operational efficiency standpoint there several ways the property manager

837
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
She's been

838
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,496
First channel access

839
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,544
Control the weather it's a vendor

840
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,128
Maintenance staff for the units occupied or unoccupied

841
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:37,248
They know who's entering the property at all times they're saving time from people having to run and get

842
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:43,648
Keys and check them out of a front office and they're also protecting themselves from rekey cost when Keys it inevitably get lost and a half

843
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,672
How to go change a lock out

844
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:51,072
From HVAC perspective to get the benefit of the thermostat controlling the temperature in on I-5 units and as we talked about

845
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:55,424
First podcast we also features in HVAC to help them

846
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
Be notified

847
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,728
When an HVAC unit

848
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
Meat service

849
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
Waters Another bitbucket

850
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
Property managers

851
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
Water sensors around

852
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,200
A water heater around main lines coming in under a sink Etc

853
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:12,576
Are very cost-effective and can help them avoid very costly water leak damage

854
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,136
And lastly propertyware tasso Weatherby

855
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,952
Doorbell cameras exterior cameras

856
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,488
Sensors Etc

857
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,024
Do we want to watch and see

858
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,632
Who's at a property in our people entering a property when that property should be unoccupied

859
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,424
Tell me about the underlying system

860
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
It takes care of

861
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,752
So with alarm.com

862
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,032
We collectively have

863
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,104
5 million individual households on our cloud

864
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,664
George very familiar with what we need to do to provide

865
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
Secure and reliable test

866
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,736
We do that by

867
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:46,624
Utilizing Z-Wave at the local level and encrypting devices there will use a private cellular lines

868
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,184
That we encrypt to get the data out of the household

869
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,464
I never had a real bus

870
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,256
Data privacy policy

871
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:56,864
That helps keep all of that individual household information safe on our cloud

872
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,936
So where can the stars go to find out more about points

873
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,520
To learn all about what we can do for both property managers

874
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,544
And residence

Welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Bruce

877
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,720
Chatterley who is the CEO of

878
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
Send it

879
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,280
Hi Bruce how are you doing today

I'm doing great thank you

881
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,352
Well thanks for doing this

882
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,936
We spend a lot of time talking about low-power wide area network

883
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,472
Works for the Internet of Things

884
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,776
And it's nice to have someone who

885
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
Talk to us

886
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
About

887
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,872
Laura specifically

888
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,152
Lorawan

889
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,944
So let's get started

890
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,992
Let's get people excited about Laura

891
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:49,088
Let's talk about some of the use cases that so far people are using it

892
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,904
This might be a good opportunity to describe

893
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,184
A little bit house in it

894
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,256
Became a player in the Lord's face we were founded in

895
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
2009

896
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,584
As one of the first iot Apple

897
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,632
Locations that has really scaled

898
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,448
It was an application that put a monitor on

899
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,264
Propane or fuel tanks in a residential environment

900
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,336
You know those big White Tanks it's outside of rural homes in

901
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
Farms in

902
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
Industrial era

903
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
At the time

904
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,712
We decided that the Lora Technology Way

905
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,992
It was a really good set

906
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,808
For this application because once you place a

907
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,856
There's usually no power at the

908
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,416
These tanks so you have to have a battery-powered sensor

909
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:29,024
In many of these sensors are in hard to get to are these tanks from hard to get to places

910
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,304
So you want it basic

911
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,632
Be able to put a sensor down and walk away for 10 years and having

912
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
Communicate flawless

913
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,192
And so we built out

914
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
We built our own sensors

915
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,008
We built our own base stations

916
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,800
Because there was no lure ecosystem

917
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,896
The time and then we built our own cloud-based software and services

918
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,688
Is to manage both the network and the

919
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,968
Devices and

920
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,992
We deploy this app

921
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,016
Location and scaled

922
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,040
Dramatically

923
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,576
One day we sat back

924
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
Instead we've got the

925
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,160
Large Lauren that work we can do more than just

926
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
Tank monitor

927
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,952
And so

928
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,976
We

929
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
Put an umbrella company

930
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
Place called Senate

931
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,352
Which was really designed to deliver horizontal app

932
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,376
Applications across the

933
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,192
Does not work one of the largest cities in the United States

934
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:12,032
The city passed an ordinance last year that said that the

935
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,824
Department of Public Health needed

936
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,640
To know where every food truck and food cart

937
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,664
In the city

938
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,712
Is at any given time so they can

939
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,736
Do random help

940
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,504
Inspections

941
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:26,624
One that deal with a systems integrator and we are pulling Network as we

942
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,904
Speak in a major city

943
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,976
We are putting trackers on

944
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,256
Initial 5000

945
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,792
Food trucks and food carts

946
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,096
And we are also working with the city

947
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
Who gave us access

948
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,912
To their public building

949
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,240
To deploy the base stations and in our parlance

950
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,264
Discord Gateway

951
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
To serve that Network

952
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,824
And now this

953
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,848
We have a network

954
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,384
The city is looking at

955
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,664
Applying multiple

956
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
Tencent net worth

957
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,504
Which is exciting

958
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,088
Case for Laura LP when were you want to put a tracker on a phone

959
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,160
Food cart could be a hot dog cart or whatever and

960
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
You don't want to have to

961
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,464
Replace it all the time

962
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,280
Can your battery life is really important

963
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,120
Can you talk to me about the difference between Laura and Laura Wang

964
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,704
Well I've been in there commingle so maybe the best way to de

965
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,496
Describe it is to put it in

966
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,544
Context of the industry and so

967
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
We kind of view the end of

968
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,104
History is being divided in

969
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,128
Three segments

970
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,408
The first segment

971
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,968
Is really about things that are close

972
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,992
To the sensor

973
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,272
And are powered

974
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,088
And are close to the communications technology

975
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,136
Sosebee bike application

976
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,440
Who's that can use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi or

977
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
Connected eats

978
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,488
And that's not what

979
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
We're focused on

980
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,280
The second segment

981
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,072
Is applications that

982
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
Require

983
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,376
Should have more high bandwidth

984
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,960
Two-way real-time Communications and that would be like telematics

985
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,496
Driverless cars those kinds

986
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:50,080
And that's a technology that 5G is being Ark

987
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,104
Architected for

988
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,407
Is really sore the Bastion

989
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
Big cellular comp

990
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:01,343
Would license technology and then the third category which we think represents about 55% of

991
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,623
Potential connector

992
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,391
Devices

993
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,671
Internet of Things

994
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,231
Is called the low powered wide area

995
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,535
Networking in really this segment

996
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,559
Is divided up into

997
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,863
To a couple players first is

998
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
Technology

999
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:19,263
People may have heard this referred to as nb-iot or cat

1000
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,311
And so it's really designed

1001
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:24,639
To be a slower speed and more cost-effective

1002
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,687
Then kind of like your home cellular sir

1003
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,527
The second category of Sky technology in this space is

1004
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,551
What I would call

1005
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,575
Proprietary

1006
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,879
How do you say these are closed ecosystem

1007
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,975
Companies that have built their own technology using

1008
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:39,999
Spectrum

1009
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:44,351
Meaning the company didn't have to pay billions of dollars to get over-the-air Spectrum

1010
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,631
And they do some

1011
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,911
Close technology

1012
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703
Which means they're the only ones that can

1013
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,983
Control NYC

1014
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,031
And manufacture the hardware

1015
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,055
And the networking

1016
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,591
Equipment associated with that

1017
00:42:55,103 --> 00:43:00,223
Those are companies examples of companies in that category would be a French company called sick Fox

1018
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,247
An American company

1019
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
Call Don

1020
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,855
And on the third category is Laura LP win

1021
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,671
And Laura LT win uses unlicensed

1022
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Spectrum

1023
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:14,047
So essentially available to anyone for use much like your homework

1024
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,327
Cordless phone uses

1025
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,351
This kind of

1026
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
Spectrum

1027
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,655
And essentially

1028
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,703
It uses of Lora protocol

1029
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,287
To create a what I would call a trickle data

1030
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
Connection

1031
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,615
So very low speed very small

1032
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,151
Small amounts of data

1033
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,479
To communicate with what I would call massively

1034
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
Scales

1035
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
Sensor application

1036
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
So these are

1037
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,087
Applications

1038
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:40,415
Is that where the requirement is for them to be deployed

1039
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,207
In either the hundreds of thousand

1040
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
Dinosaur the Millions

1041
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,767
In terms of device cam

1042
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,303
And for application

1043
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,351
Things that require very long battery

1044
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,679
So what we're finding and Laura is up to

1045
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
10 year battery life

1046
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,239
In some cases longer

1047
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,311
And require very efficient Network

1048
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,335
Deployment so

1049
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,431
With the Lora technology I think the world record for a sensor

1050
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:06,271
Communicating with a Gateway or a base station is 70 MI

1051
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:09,343
What I mean by efficient as you don't need a lot of base station

1052
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
To get

1053
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,647
Really really good cover

1054
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,183
In the United States

1055
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,511
You know it's pretty common knowledge that Laura

1056
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
And

1057
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:22,911
The cellular license Technologies for LP when are going to be the winners and the Laura ecosystem

1058
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,191
Time is growing dramatica

1059
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,263
Play inside I was at a conference last week where they

1060
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:32,895
Show statistics that the Laura Alliance which is gone from 0 to over 500

1061
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,663
Numbers

1062
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,479
Is one of the fastest growing technology alliances

1063
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,527
In history so it's got a lot of them

1064
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,087
Lets people a little bit with

1065
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,927
With this characterization because I talked to a lot of people who are really excited about law

1066
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,279
But they are very concerned about being pulled into Semtech witch

1067
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,559
Is the

1068
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,863
Primary maker of Lora chips

1069
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,935
They're sorry I'm curious this is an issue that came up

1070
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,959
How many years ago was

1071
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,239
Z-Wave

1072
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,519
Because signal was there

1073
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,823
Producer so I'm just curious your thoughts on

1074
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,639
Well I think the first thought is

1075
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,455
Is that the reason were excited about Laura is

1076
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,247
Is that it's an open standard

1077
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:13,087
So it's published and anyone can actually

1078
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,159
Create technology both hardware and software

1079
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,183
To connect in

1080
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
The standard

1081
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,231
NBA player in

1082
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,767
Any part of the Eagles

1083
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,583
The second thing I would say is

1084
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,863
Is that some tax

1085
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,887
Is actually license

1086
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,959
Sing the chip technology for manufacturer

1087
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
Two other chip maker

1088
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,263
And so we're starting

1089
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,031
Can you see that

1090
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:32,799
Ecosystem

1091
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
Groin

1092
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,103
In fact it wisely

1093
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,127
The manufacturer

1094
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Floor chips

1095
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,919
Tutu

1096
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,711
Very very large chip

1097
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,783
Is one is microchip and I believe the other is

1098
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,807
Stmicro

1099
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
So we're starting to

1100
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,367
Some diversification

1101
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
Significant

1102
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,159
Verification

1103
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,695
Insource of chips

1104
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,743
You know while simtek is the

1105
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,023
Original owner of the

1106
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,047
The protocol

1107
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
I think the

1108
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:58,399
The technology itself is getting more and more pervasive

1109
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,959
In the public domain and there are more and more

1110
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,983
Either license

1111
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,287
Store participating innovators in

1112
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
In the ecosystem

1113
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,615
So let's go to this idea because

1114
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:11,199
It's one thing to track location using something like this

1115
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,271
It's another thing to get lots of data on a Lowrance

1116
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,831
I'm at work so it's not about the constraints of the technology

1117
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,903
My understanding is your data rates are

1118
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,183
Are fairly Limited

1119
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
Yep they are highly

1120
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,743
Red so

1121
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,303
You really young and that's why in my view

1122
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,863
When I talked about the landscape of the industry

1123
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
Is that

1124
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:33,215
You know the iot industry is not homogeneous

1125
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,543
There are opportunities for multiple Technologies

1126
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,335
And it's really a matter of

1127
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Sitting

1128
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
The characteristic

1129
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,151
Except the technology

1130
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,455
Lead to the ideal application and so

1131
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,015
What we're looking for our application

1132
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,295
Things that require

1133
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,087
Very limited data that

1134
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,879
Require very long battery life

1135
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,183
And so obviously not powered

1136
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:56,255
And require a network that's very efficiently

1137
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,839
Deployed and so the end result of that ends up being that you need

1138
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
End up

1139
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Serving

1140
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,167
An application

1141
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,447
With a network

1142
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,519
Gets down into a couple dollars a year

1143
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,567
Per device for monthly recurring

1144
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Cars

1145
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,615
So it's really important

1146
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:17,759
Automatically give me another example in the Smart City space were working with the largest water meter

1147
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,527
Manufacture

1148
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,575
In the world and in fact

1149
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,343
Water

1150
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,623
As a utility is

1151
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
Perfect application

1152
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Because

1153
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:25,951
Usually

1154
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,231
The water meters are on

1155
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,535
Empowered they're usually in very hard to get

1156
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,327
Two places and that's another

1157
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,655
Strength of Laura because of the 900 megahertz specs

1158
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,983
Scott very good propagation characteristics

1159
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
Meaning of

1160
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,287
Penetrate concrete

1161
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,335
Water meters are usually in pits

1162
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,639
So they're very hard to get to and so

1163
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,175
Will be announcing in the neck

1164
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:51,551
Week or two of full City that we've deployed with a water meter manufacturer

1165
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:57,951
So that's another really good example and by the way they communicate once or twice a day and they just Bass

1166
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
We take a reading

1167
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,255
A very small package

1168
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,047
So to your point

1169
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,071
The perfect fit

1170
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,351
For the Lord technology

1171
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,423
So let's talk about the carriers because

1172
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,239
While you mentioned 5G but they're also

1173
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
Working

1174
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,543
Some of them not all of them

1175
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:15,359
On nb iot and Cat M1

1176
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:20,479
These look very competitive with what Laura's doing except it would be obviously

1177
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,503
Bison Spectrum

1178
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:25,855
And I'm just curious your thoughts there I believe the modules are also

1179
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,695
More expensive so it's more expensive to put that capability in the end device

1180
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:33,023
Right it's less flexible from a deployment

1181
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:36,863
One of the things that's interesting about iot and I've started in this

1182
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,655
Business in June of last year

1183
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:45,311
And one of those things I've learned is the only thing certain and by the way this goes for wireless carriers as well as for us

1184
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,895
The only thing certain when an application provider comes to us

1185
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,431
Is that we won't have coverage

1186
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,479
100% of the places they need it

1187
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,783
And one of the strengths of Laura is

1188
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,831
To buy a gateway

1189
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:59,135
And create coverage and other gateways

1190
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:02,207
Run anywhere from 3,000 to $5,000

1191
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
Versus

1192
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,255
What we all know about

1193
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,791
Cell tower Gateway

1194
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,351
C&R or a base stations very very

1195
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,167
So while the NB iot guys were

1196
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:11,935
Will tell you that

1197
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,471
It's just a software update

1198
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:18,079
What do they do when you need coverage in a farmer's field where you don't currently have coverage

1199
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:18,847
And

1200
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,663
We have a great model for that will put a Gateway on top of

1201
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
The grain silo

1202
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,479
And that will then cover

1203
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:27,295
That application and by the way once we've done that

1204
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,575
Tank monitoring

1205
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,599
Send a play

1206
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,391
Soil moisture monitoring

1207
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,671
Yeah there's a variety of Apple

1208
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:37,023
Locations we can do on that day station so I think there are also and I'm not an ex

1209
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,815
Expert in NB iot but from

1210
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,351
Comparison standpoint

1211
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,143
We have better battery life

1212
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,471
Regardless of what you're reading we've done side-by-side comparison

1213
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,751
Their cost azure

1214
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:47,519
He said

1215
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
Fire

1216
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,823
Because of the technology in the

1217
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,895
Device and the cost of services

1218
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,687
Just hire so there are limitations

1219
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,735
That we don't have in fact

1220
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,295
We were the first ones in the United States

1221
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,575
To demonstrate back in

1222
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,623
In Las Vegas a couple weeks ago

1223
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:05,183
A new capability that Laura has

1224
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,719
It's called geolocation

1225
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,743
And just a quick

1226
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
Description

1227
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,047
The way Laura works

1228
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:10,815
What is very

1229
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
Cell towers

1230
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,399
In that a sensor Allura sense

1231
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
Is it cancer

1232
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,471
Cafa station

1233
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,239
It will

1234
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
Communicate with

1235
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,823
So for example if I've deployed 5

1236
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,591
Gateway's

1237
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
Air base station

1238
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
China City

1239
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,151
NF sensor

1240
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,175
Can see all five

1241
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,967
It will simultaneously

1242
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,247
Communicate with all five

1243
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,551
And what that creates is an opportunity

1244
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,087
To take readings

1245
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,367
From all five of those

1246
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:38,463
Antennas and send that data to what's called a solver

1247
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
And

1248
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:43,327
Basically create a fairly accurate location for that ass

1249
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,631
It's all done without GPS

1250
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,167
Which has a couple dentist

1251
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,959
1 GPS

1252
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,983
Chips are expense

1253
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,263
Relative basis

1254
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,287
Casino in terms of

1255
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,311
The end device

1256
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,871
And to GPS is a big battery

1257
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,687
And by the way the advantage of GPS is a

1258
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,967
It's very precise and

1259
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,503
You know it's limited by the

1260
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,575
In terms of how precise it is with the Laura Kate

1261
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,111
Disability I think it's

1262
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,391
Yeah probably

1263
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,231
Safe to say that you can get within 50 Mi of the asset

1264
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:15,327
Now there other carriers doing Laura deployment so

1265
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,983
There's orange in France has a lower deployment and then I'm also thinking of Comcast has a division called machine

1266
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,519
Thank you that's doing lorawan

1267
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,847
Are you guys involved in that or is that just Tianjin

1268
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:30,687
That is tangential so Comcast has announced

1269
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:35,551
So they're going to deploy 12 cities I believe and I believe they've only deployed three

1270
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,087
You know I think it's good

1271
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:41,439
It's a good anointing of the Lora technology that a company like Comcast

1272
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,463
Has chosen it

1273
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,047
As its iot Network so I think that's positive

1274
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,631
And then the second thing I would say is you're right there are many Network

1275
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,167
Deployed around the world

1276
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:54,495
In particular from incumbent Wireless carriers like orange and

1277
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
Kpn

1278
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
Niy Friday bother

1279
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,615
And what's interesting is we were also the

1280
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,663
The first in the US to demonstrate

1281
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,455
In Las Vegas at CES

1282
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,015
The new roaming interface for Laura

1283
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,039
Call one version

1284
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,087
And it's a roaming interface

1285
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:12,927
What'll be interesting is if you're orange and you have an Enterprise

1286
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,231
That's the point sensors for a global app

1287
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:19,583
Application through this roaming interface you could place devices on the Senate Network

1288
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,863
Can the United States and Canada

1289
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,167
What kind of pricing your house

1290
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:26,239
How would that work I think about Romanian you know my wallet instinct

1291
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:31,103
Whenever so is that going to follow kind of the cellular model

1292
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,663
Will it look different I mean

1293
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,479
Business

1294
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,271
Terms are being negotiated as we

1295
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,295
We speak but

1296
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,575
What I could say is

1297
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,343
It has to

1298
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,879
You cannot follow

1299
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,159
Cellular model

1300
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:47,487
That model was designed on a $50 per month kind of

1301
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,839
And as I said earlier we're talking $2 to $2

1302
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,863
Per year per device

1303
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,167
And so there's a unique model that need

1304
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,191
Be created here

1305
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
That

1306
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,495
Yahweh centrally is

1307
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,519
Ends up being

1308
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:03,615
In the pennies if anything at all and I think you're going to see a lot of partnership

1309
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,895
Versus caffe

1310
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,663
Roaming

1311
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,687
Commercial agreement

1312
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,991
They are based on the economics of the business

1313
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,271
And what me

1314
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:14,623
No one other Innovation that sun it announced last year

1315
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,415
So when are customers too

1316
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,951
Deploy Lora network

1317
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,231
We allowed them

1318
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,511
How to register

1319
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,535
Their Network

1320
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:25,375
They stations to what's called a LPN virtual Network

1321
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,935
Work sucks whenever we Implement a customer

1322
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:32,031
Whether it be a carrier or a systems integrator or a application

1323
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
Provider

1324
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,335
We always connect does not work

1325
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,895
Works together virtually through this lvm

1326
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:39,199
And essentially what that allows is

1327
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,503
As long as they're on our LVN

1328
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,343
Any one of our customers can put a device on any one of our other custom

1329
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,671
And whoever the hosting network is

1330
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,207
Will get a share of

1331
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:50,975
Is revenue

1332
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
From that

1333
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,767
Devices Revenue

1334
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
Okay

1335
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:58,143
And what's interesting is that open up business models that we didn't even

1336
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,959
Contemplate when we conceived of this LDN

1337
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,263
And I'll give you an example we're talkin

1338
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,847
Two owners of commercial cell towers who are saying hey

1339
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,895
That means I can buy the Gateway

1340
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,431
Put it up on my cell tower

1341
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,967
And I can sit back

1342
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,735
Flask devices

1343
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
Disconnect

1344
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,039
Can generate

1345
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,599
And so we're doing that

1346
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,623
We're also talking

1347
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:21,439
The owners of commercial signs and billboards

1348
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,207
And so in fact

1349
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,999
Dinner Las Vegas Network that we

1350
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,279
2.4 CES

1351
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,071
Three of our gateways are on

1352
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:27,839
Commercial dildo

1353
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,911
And they're doing the same thing I've got these assets

1354
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,727
Empowered and usually connected to the internet these

1355
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,495
Laura

1356
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,311
Gateways are very small you know maybe

1357
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,847
6in by 6in

1358
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,127
12in by 12in

1359
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,687
And they put them up on their goboard

1360
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,271
And because of the LDN model they can generate Revenue stream off

1361
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,879
And let's talk about how many devices you can serve on one

1362
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:55,231
I know that's highly dependent on how often they're paying the Gateway

1363
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:56,511
Datastream

1364
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,791
And all of that but

1365
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,839
Like I mean even cellular Networks

1366
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,375
You can only

1367
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,911
You can only cram so many bits

1368
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:03,935
So

1369
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,983
What are those limitations look

1370
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
Yeah it's

1371
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:14,687
Obviously highly dependent on which Gateway you choose but if you have a macro cell that's a high-capacity macro cell

1372
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:18,015
AR testing is showing you know up to 200000 device

1373
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,039
Gateway

1374
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,087
The other things it to know is

1375
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,135
Is that as I said earlier that

1376
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,415
A single device

1377
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,695
Will most likely be

1378
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,255
Communicating with multiple gateways simultaneously

1379
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,303
So if there's a capacity

1380
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,095
Constrain on one it will automatically

1381
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,887
You know switch to another

1382
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,959
All right I feel like I know a lot more about Laura now

1383
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,775
Thank you so much Bruce I appreciate you coming on the show today

1384
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,311
Yeah thank you for your time
