Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast I have your host Stacey Higginbotham

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,824
And this is your co-host

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,848

And this week's podcast

5
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,712
Is brought to you by security we have

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,784
A quick word about Kevo we're going to be talking about Google

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,320
And we got

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,904
A new chip from arm we got some autonomous car laws

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
And a new security framework for the industrial internet-of-things plus an assortment of bits and bobs

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
If we get today

11
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:39,936
And this week's guest is John Troutman of canary the All In One Security System talking about

12
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,240
How to build services for The Internet of Things

13
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,288
But before we get anywhere

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,824
Let's have a quick word

Did you will not want to miss the smart Kitchen Summit an event that's happening October 5th and 6th

18
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816
It explores the technology and design convergence that's changing how we eat buy and store it in Iraq

19
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,216
With our food the smart Kitchen Summit is brought to you by my friend Michael Wolff show and he's created

Alright let's start this week show

23
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
So

24
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
Last week

25
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
We talked about the

26
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,672
Kevo Smart Lock

27
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,440
Which

28
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,792
2nd generation Kevo and I said that I was not enjoying it so much because it was

29
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,376
Is a bit iffy the touch-to-open feature didn't always work

30
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,752
You're not the only one that actually had some issues too from reviews that I read

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
True

32
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,872
But you know I'm still playing with it maybe it'll get better over time but I did

33
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
Actually make a mistake

34
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
Winnipesaukee

35
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
This is terrible

36
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
It happens it does

37
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
But we hate when it

38
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,088
Happened so let me let me correct this

39
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,672
I told you guys that the smart key rekeying feature

40
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,744
Was a new feature in the Kevo 2nd gen

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
But it's not

42
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
It's actually what they've done is maven

43
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Improved it

44
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
Moore security

45
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
So

46
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,704
Do so people know in case they missed it or don't know what

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,776
Smart key is that's where you can actually bring your own key to the lock

48
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
And have the lock

49
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,872
Intelligently rekey itself to the key correct

50
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
Yes

51
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
Is it only for

52
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
I think it's only fair

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
That's a good question I know the Kwikset

54
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
Lock that I have

55
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:38,976
Does it so yeah I guess maybe it is that's a good question I had to get something else around here and by saying yes when I don't know

56
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,560
I haven't seen it yeah I haven't seen on other brands

57
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
But

58
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
Searching

59
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,896
Yeah I don't I don't recall seeing that on other another devices and

60
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,712
It was actually kind of interesting

61
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,760
New technology that's only offered in select

62
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
Kwikset keyed entry

63
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
There you go

64
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
There you go

65
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
So we got it we got it right that time

66
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
We did we got it right

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
And I should also say

68
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
I don't

69
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
If in the excitement over this

70
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
I mentioned that

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
The Kevo Kwikset

72
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Bob's

73
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
So the little fobs you can carry

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
They actually just

75
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
Actors

76
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,640
A replacement for your phone so you might give that to your kid if they don't have a smartphone

77
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
And then they too

78
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
Can touch soap

79
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,320
Yeah so it's like a Bluetooth presence sensor probably

80
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
Yes

81
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
There's the Kevo stuff

82
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,024
The bottom line still is that this lock is

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
A still a bit temper

84
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
It works it's really cool

85
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
You Really Want Your Love

86
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
100%

87
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
Moving along

88
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
Let's talk about

89
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
I don't know Kevin

90
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,128
Which of our things should we talk about you talk about the new autonomous car laws

91
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:07,296
We can do that cuz it's going to turn into something else on the chips either we're going to talk about later so the Federal

92
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:13,440
Government has decided before the states get all crazy with car laws for autonomous cars

93
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,024
We're going to put out a list of guidelines and

94
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,071
I don't the regulations yet

95
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
But

96
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
It's a framework

97
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:27,263
So framework that's what we call things and in-flight yes it's a Frameworks

98
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,335
It's just a framework

99
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
. so not only

100
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
Framework that is

101
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
A public framework

102
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,527
Yeah so so this is going to

103
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
Address

104
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:46,207
Some of the potential rules of the road for autonomous cars again before the states decide to all do different things

105
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:52,095
Really be crazy for car manufacturers in such as to deal with so we didn't look at it I think it's like a

106
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
300 Pages this thing is

107
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
15 rules okay

108
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
We can't call the rules

109
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
Suggestions

110
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,359
It's a 15-point safety assessment that's

111
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
That's my bad CI

112
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,943
Yeah what they're talking about

113
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
Is some of the things

114
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
Include

115
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
Ethics so

116
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
What

117
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,391
So having the same set of ethical decisions around a self-driving car so

118
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
Do you run over the small child

119
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,071
I'm going to suggest no and I really don't need the government to tell me that but anyway

120
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
You know you're not enough

121
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,495
And I imagine there's going to be safety standards

122
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Like I said

123
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
Like we have ISO

124
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
We have nist standards for the

125
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,431
Elements of physical safety

126
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
Echeckup

127
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,063
Don't make sense that makes sense and also in here I see some information about

128
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,391
The manufacturers of these cars providing actual data

129
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
And I guess that's going to help

130
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,255
Home some of the potential rules of the road later on

131
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
I wonder how these sad that you know how the Tesla's and all these other car companies are going to feel about sharing such data because

132
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,007
I just think back to the unfortunate incidents with Tesla of of late

133
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,895
You know I'm sure they they want to do their own investigations keep all the information kind of close to the to the best

134
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:13,247
But I don't know they're all going to be able to do that and are they going to push back on that

135
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,783
I think it's important

136
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
To have

137
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,623
There may be rules about like how the data shared

138
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
Like make it doesn't become

139
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
Completely public

140
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
But it's important for every autumn

141
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
Reddit self driving

142
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
And it shouldn't should actually starting

143
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
2B standard

144
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,911
And in some cases it may be

145
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,703
How kind of a black box so

146
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:37,311
When something happens we can determine exactly what happen

147
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,127
Is it a software failure is it

148
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
Driver error

149
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Somehow

150
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
Just like we have with planes

151
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
Just because

152
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,855
We're going to have to be able to interview these cars basic

153
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
If some

154
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Nothing goes wrong

155
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
Safety purposes but also like lawsuit

156
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
So

157
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
Right

158
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
Thanks Obama

159
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
Temperature

160
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,983
Also on the safety front

161
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
So if your autonomous car

162
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
It's got to be super safe

163
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Because there's

164
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
The risk of a huge loss of

165
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:18,271
What should be in that car I wanted to be there new cortex r52 design

166
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,319
That they put out this week

167
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
And this is a chip

168
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
Actually it's not a chip

169
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Sorry

170
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,511
Arm is a company that licenses its architecture to other ship make

171
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
A design

172
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,863
The first licensee is St micro

173
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,263
And this is for it's for autonomous cars robotics it's for what did you say Kevin something about loss of life and limb

174
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:44,895
Will it it adheres to certain standards in industrial circles

175
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,687
Set that have to do with safety and

176
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,783
There's a whole level of criticality on potential accidents that this would

177
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,183
Theoretically avoid and yes so they categorize them by you know but just a minor injury maybe loss of it.

178
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,999
Whenever I live to massive loss of life

179
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,327
So it kind of fits with the car which a moving vehicle could

180
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
You know take out 50 people so

181
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:11,007
They're playing industry level standards to the Safety and Security of the cortex r52

182
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,567
In my Safety and Security they're talking about

183
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:18,943
Prevention from hackers root access to the chip itself but they're also talking about

184
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
How the chip is built

185
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,295
So it's built to be really fast

186
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,599
In understanding what's going on

187
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,159
To be incredibly redundant

188
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,047
So there are two processors working in parallel to do each job so if One processor overheat

189
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,351
I can lose one engine you still got one left

190
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,911
So these are the types of thing

191
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Talking about this is a new design

192
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
And it shows how the

193
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
Somebody is trying to

194
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
The push into

195
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
Obviously outside of just

196
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,407
Apple phones fit into all of these

197
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
Robotics and Industrial

198
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,991
Kind of manufacturing jobs that are

199
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
Happy just Automation in general

200
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,927
They're showing all kinds of potential applications are saying farming Healthcare Industrial

201
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
Obviously Transportation building automation

202
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,511
Aviation

203
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:10,399
So they won't expand obviously beyond the handheld devices and such that they're pretty much known for right right now

204
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:14,239
And this is an area that's really up in the air because Nvidia has been doing

205
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Great work

206
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
Self-driving car side

207
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,919
With the processing of like lidar and radar and all of this information

208
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
And

209
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
This doesn't

210
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,551
Do the cortex r52 isn't going to be

211
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,879
Investigating your lighter this is the stuff that's going to be

212
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,463
Running your engine and making sure that all the information

213
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
It's coming into it

214
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
Actually

215
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
Is acted upon accordingly

216
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Yeah

217
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,727
It'll be it'll be interesting cuz you're right in video

218
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,823
The last couple CES show is NVIDIA time how you think that four years ago and

219
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
Their partner speaker would be like

220
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,943
Audi and they were talking about it look at our trip runs their dashboard

221
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,015
Dismiss missing their car I wonder if Nvidia

222
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
Which is an RN license ewill

223
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,927
Implement the core r52 security features in some of their upcoming ship designs for the cars

224
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
Hello we shall see

225
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
Another security story for you

226
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
Industrial internet Consortium

227
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
Which is

228
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,519
It's just a bunch of companies I'm not even to go through all of them tons of companies EMC now Dell

229
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
All these guys doing

230
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
Industrial internet stuff

231
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,383
Have released on Monday

232
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,199
An industrial Internet Security framework

233
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
There's that word again Kevin

234
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
So this is the iic

235
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
Doing the ISS

236
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,391
Independent set of best practices to help people

237
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Assess risk

238
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
And defend against

239
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
So

240
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
This is

241
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,767
The big threat

242
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,815
For the industrial internet-of-things

243
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,351
What is nobody knows how to

244
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:49,471
There's no standard everybody's doing different things at everyone's pointing fingers when things go wrong

245
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
In

246
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
It's terrible

247
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,103
This group says it wants to identify requirements to

248
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Create stand

249
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
Syncope

250
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Practices

251
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
It's a good idea it is

252
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,783
They haven't gotten into big specifics they're basically like

253
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,367
Hear the big things we need to focus on safety reliability

254
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
Resilience

255
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
Security and privacy

256
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
Electoral Givens obviously but I do like that they are outlining the areas that they're focusing on an accent

257
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,655
Communications monitoring and configuration

258
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
So at least

259
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:24,031
Because I said something physical to think about here and see where they're going with us

260
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,871
And they did something that's really smart and this is something that I

261
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,711
I think we take for granted a lot they're pointing out that everybody

262
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
In the chain

263
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Kaiser roll

264
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,063
Also in a chip makers to

265
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,623
Systems integrators to the actual end-users

266
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,255
I think that's really important and we don't kind of harp on this enough insecurity

267
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,815
But it matters in this way

268
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,655
So it's not enough to be like oh I just bought a new secure smartphone

269
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
And actually

270
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,751
This is a wonderful example actually this week

271
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055
Where someone posted on Reddit that

272
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,151
Their neighbor was able to unlock their front door using their

273
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Siri

274
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,991
Telling Siri to unlock the front door

275
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
In August lock that was attached to Siri

276
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
Is part of the homekit thing

277
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
And I read this and I was like

278
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
Okay no

279
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,767
That is not how that could ever happen

280
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
What actually did happen

281
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Bend is

282
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,631
When you use homekit to unlock a door

283
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
It makes you

284
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
Put in your path

285
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
Even if your phone's like

286
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Hanging out there

287
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Or the iPad

288
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
And

289
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,103
This particular user apparently didn't have a

290
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Password on there

291
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,967
Hello major major faux pas

292
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
So

293
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,063
This is a wonderful example of hay user

294
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,879
You are also responsible for your own security

295
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Be in the situation

296
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Yes

297
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
And

298
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:51,327
I also bring this up in case anybody is running homekit and doesn't have a password on their iPad or

299
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
Because Hey look

300
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,471
I'm a little skeptical about the story itself but

301
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,823
You know I'm a maybe I can I don't have a

302
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,871
I'm Catholic I mean

303
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,455
The thermostat hear it which I can control my voice in a security issue there

304
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
I would love to get to really see if that

305
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,551
An accurate story because if it is

306
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,391
Well yes I agree with you 100% from a user standpoint

307
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:19,743
That iPad a homekit Hub whatever she is should have a password

308
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,303
I think there's a little bit of

309
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,119
An opportunity for improvement on Apple spark there

310
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,423
To say if you're going to

311
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Control these things by voice

312
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
Require password on the device

313
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
That's a fair

314
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,663
Amiibo spoofing should happen I'm not I'm not blaming Apple here I'm just saying nothing area for opportunity

315
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,967
The user should absolutely have the password there

316
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
Yes and

317
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
This is why

318
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,831
Like the August integration

319
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,671
The echo the Amazon Echo doesn't actually allow you to unlock the

320
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
She calmly lock your door

321
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Exactly

322
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
Yes so anyway

323
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
Safety Frameworks

324
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,143
Tell me about recognizing the entire chain of value

325
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
One more security type thing

326
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
I was at fig monk last week

327
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
London witch

328
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
Amy's really super hot

329
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,871
My God it was like almost 90° there

330
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
And there's no air conditioning Inlet

331
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,759
There was three presentations about the Smart Home

332
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
Antenna consumer iot that

333
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
Really bums me out

334
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,647
Basically there is a lovely fellow

335
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
Whose house

336
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
Sounds like my house basically

337
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,023
Play he's implemented all of these things

338
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
And

339
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
He was miserable

340
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:33,215
On the smart home because it's it's

341
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
Which is

342
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:40,383
But he also pointed out that most IP security cameras can be

343
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,943
Gordon Court hacked by just sticking a

344
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,015
Paperclip in them to reset them which I haven't thought about

345
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
But

346
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,719
No I mean that that okay so that resets it and then I guess you could set up yourself as a user and didn't gainax

347
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Access to it

348
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:00,351
And probably the individual owns the camera wouldn't really know other than the fact that they can no longer see their camera

349
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
Right so if you

350
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
You came in and ride

351
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,495
They did not in every case so especially cameras that set up their own wife

352
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
Wifi hotspot so if you brought your own way

353
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
MiFi hotspot

354
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Eventually

355
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Wifi hotspot

356
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
This isn't something I've

357
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
But even just hit a reset just

358
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
Turns off at

359
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
It reset

360
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
So right

361
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
You're no longer

362
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
Yeah

363
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
So I thought about that

364
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,559
All right I'm going to have to Outlaw the paperclip

365
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
Dang it

366
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,703
It's so useful for resetting

367
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
So there's there's one thing that I learned it

368
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
And then basically

369
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
We got a long way to go and smart

370
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Yeah

371
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
But we're getting there

372
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
This is a fun

373
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
Kind of concept as we're

374
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,063
Coming up to October 4th which is the

375
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,391
David Google is presumably launching Google home

376
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Here we should

377
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
Take a moment for

378
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
Kevin's disclosure

379
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,583
Yep I consult for Google and I do not work on any other Smart Home Products

380
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,631
I told any views are my own

381
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
And store

382
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
I was speaking Google

383
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
When you talk to Google

384
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
You don't say that

385
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,847
Like when you talk to Amazon you say hey she who shall not be named

386
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
Hey Siri

387
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
Sorry if not you're okay cuz

388
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,343
Press the buttons on the phone song

389
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
For much longer

390
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
All right

391
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
So you have

392
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
These women

393
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Google

394
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Have a name

395
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,375
Google home have a name

396
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,471
OSHA 12 students assistant have

397
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,567
Assisting is what Google calls its AI ever

398
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
Hertz in

399
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
Write the powers

400
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
When you say

401
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
Should I say it ok Google

402
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,759
Brexit who doesn't have a

403
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,063
A name it's a mean other than the company name

404
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,415
Right it's a branding thing to me so I don't really have a problem I think

405
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,255
I'm very used to eat saying OK Google to my devices

406
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,791
I have four I don't know

407
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
3ish Warriors how long

408
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
It's been out

409
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
But how if you've got like

410
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,495
My phone is almost always around if I say that am I going to set off my phone

411
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Pain in my home

412
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
That was a question that

413
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,895
Many people had a Google IO in Google home was actually showing off we don't

414
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
No because

415
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,759
They're not going into details about that so

416
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,831
Her people don't know you on an Android device

417
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
You can have

418
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,463
Your phone always listening as well as an Android Wear watch if you raise it

419
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,767
You can say OK Google and

420
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
Korean sauce

421
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
So how will all this work

422
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,631
But the same keyword is the question

423
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
And I don't think that

424
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,215
Question has been answered yet so

425
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
My suspicions

426
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,079
Is yes it will cause conflict

427
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
Commence just a guess on my part

428
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,479
That's because there's no mechanism in place today to prevent it from multiple

429
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,783
Android Wear Android devices

430
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,111
Right so unless there's eight some new secret sauce

431
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
Hearing Google home

432
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
It will be an issue

433
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
What about the

434
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
I always mess up

435
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
What is a

436
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
VSP

437
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,839
That Amazon introduced for the

438
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
Multiple echos

439
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
The latest I

440
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
With room level

441
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
Right

442
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:27,711
So yeah so that was announced last week with a. Where if you have multiple Echo devices which she would

443
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
And I both do

444
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
When you speak

445
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
Out loud to them

446
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,599
Only one should

447
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,647
Listen to take action words today

448
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,535
Got me I have two or three of them go at the same time because they can all hear me so my guess is they are then

449
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,375
Owning the software to say which is the highest level

450
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,191
Up from the microphone and I'm going to presume that

451
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,007
The one the person speaking together closest to it

452
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,591
So they could do something like that here with Google home

453
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Possible

454
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,943
Or if knowing a phone is in the house today

455
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,271
Are nearby maybe they route everything to the

456
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,671
Well I don't know I don't know

457
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:14,815
It gets complex when you start doing things like that because you're relying on so many different potential data points that you may or may not have

458
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,167
Agreed but it will actually that goes to what I was going to say

459
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,447
Google

460
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,495
Probably does know

461
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,823
If your phone has the always listening function on

462
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,431
Because all this is tied your Google account and there's Telemetry information that can read

463
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,503
So my guess is

464
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,855
I'm getting more people than not actually don't have the always listening function on

465
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
Japanese

466
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
It's not on by default

467
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
So typically you have to like

468
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,023
To use the function you have to actually go into the

469
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,047
Google app

470
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,607
Pour into a Google search screen

471
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,703
And from there once it's enabled you can say OK Google it will do

472
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
Whatever

473
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,031
I think very few people have that always listening

474
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
Picture on always on their phone

475
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,639
No this was just cuz like

476
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
And then there's also the personality

477
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
I mean I would not

478
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
She who shall not

479
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
She's getting there

480
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
To get their High great as

481
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
I've never actually

482
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:19,071
Yeah but I like Cortana Lotta Love what Microsoft is down there

483
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,119
NF personality are for sure it's

484
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:27,519
I think she's a really good example of a blend between Siri and Google Now to be quite honest and

485
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
Play well done

486
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:35,199
I don't know even even on the new today Google released the allo messaging app and that has assistant built in

487
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
And as well

488
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
So that way if you're in a chat

489
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,599
You can even make me make a group chat you can do a nap Google

490
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:48,255
In the chat and say show up show me great taco places right and everybody will see the results and we can all decide oh yeah let's go

491
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,095
So but there's no name it's just

492
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
Google it's at Google right

493
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
Teuta consistent thing

494
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,263
Do we like it or not I don't know I'm guessing you don't you

495
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,055
Just like I just

496
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
As you move it

497
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,407
A as it becomes more aware of

498
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
It feels weird

499
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
To have it be

500
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,111
And then also

501
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,208
As it's in your house and more people are interacting with it like

502
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,256
Yes my daughter will be fine

503
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
I'm saying

504
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,608
Alexa in some ways and I'm sorry

505
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
Guys

506
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,216
Has become like our arbitrator at the dinner table for exam

507
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:33,568
Pause for a moment

508
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
Oh wait no

509
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
We're like boom

510
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
And she's almost got like a seat at the

511
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
Inside

512
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,600
I totally get that because and doesn't sound stupid when we stayed anyway there many many times just buy

513
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
Conditioning in

514
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,208
And politeness when I'm done speaking to my echo I'll say thank you

515
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,024
I wouldn't do that with

516
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,816
Google home I don't

517
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Cuz it's a

518
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:00,192
Company it's a brand it's not a personality or a

519
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,496
In a person in a in a box

520
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
So to speak

521
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,336
Flip a person out of the box

522
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
Orsillo

523
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
Kushner and air freshener

524
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
Alright so

525
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
That is our

526
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Our question

527
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
It's not a food never done but now we have one

528
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,184
So it's not bad

529
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,976
All right I think that's

530
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Cats

531
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,352
Great for this week show please stay tuned for john-troutman a co-founder of

532
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,912
Canary which just launched a brand new outdoor camera

533
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
And a new service that

534
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
Is really

535
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
Interesting

536
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,848
First a message from our sponsor

537
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:45,248
This week's monster is macadamia and we are talking about the role of prototypes I have time in the day in for Macadamia

538
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:49,600
And Kevin Bailey the CEO of design first anyone can make a prototype

539
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
What should I be eating

540
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
To do when I stop

541
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
This process

542
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
With the maker movement

543
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,792
Anyone can build something and deliver a proof-of-concept

544
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:04,192
But detected make a prototype that actually looks and feels like the actual product should can get it

545
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,752
User passed a Chasm of disbelief

546
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:12,384
Actually touch it and feel it and start thinking about the services that that product can deliver for them

547
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Questions

548
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,432
Should my prototype

549
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
Seek to answer

550
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
It's helping you answer

551
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,296
Whether you can make this product desirable

552
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,368
And will you be able to make 500 of these and at what cost

553
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
And can you

554
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,976
Kayla can you deliver it to thousands of users ethical is viral

555
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,048
A lot of people think that building a prototype is more just

556
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
Putting their ideas in physical Hardware

557
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,888
And bring that into show

558
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
Without thinking about the

559
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,472
Future manufacturing viability

560
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,544
Is that really the right way to design something like this

561
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,128
The concern there is it if you start moving from makerbase

562
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:50,528
Piece of hardware and try to commercialize it you're going to miss some key elements around security around have you been asked

563
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,600
Scale with a platform is with the cloud infrastructure is

564
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:59,232
And by building a prototype on top of the scalable platform from the get-go which the cloud enables

565
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
You can actually save a number of iteration

566
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,304
And get there

567
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,424
For a cheaper and faster

568
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
Physical

569
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,728
And software

570
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
Virtual based

571
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:14,592
How do we think about bringing those two experiences together

572
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,384
The challenge with the hardware

573
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
Inside wall is

574
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,224
To understand limitations

575
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,504
Communications

576
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,856
Coin collection of us playthrough

577
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:31,232
Proof of concept where you have a very rich

578
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Play

579
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,328
Only to find out on the product you going to have to come up with something much

580
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:41,728
Experiential and turn the colors and then size of this playing

581
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:46,080
Concepts

582
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
Cos2x

583
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:51,456
That way when people experience about accusing optimize around

584
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,784
Something still enjoyable within the context of what product

585
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Become

586
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:59,648
The whole proof-of-concept is looking at Opportunity risk

587
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,304
It's an opportunity with balance the designers are looking at opportunity and then the engineer

588
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,096
Earring team is looking at with

589
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
And their jobs

590
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,168
Change nothing

591
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,216
Together any prototyping

592
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
You really doing

593
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
Creation building test

594
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Sing learning

595
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,664
And that posters get you towards a viable

596
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
So if you can balance the risk and Designs constraints earlier on in the Prototype phase you'll be able to ski

597
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:34,208
Scale that prototype as it involves and take many of the ideas and Concepts from that prototype into production

598
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Commercial

599
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
Where can we find more

Hey everybody this is Stacey Higginbotham and you are listening to the internet

602
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
We are back with this week

603
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,200
Guessed it is John Troutman who is a co-founder at

604
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Neri

605
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
Hi John how are you doing today

606
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,832
Hi Stacy I'm great thanks for having me on the show

607
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,904
Thanks for coming I have like the canary forever

608
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,488
And by forever I mean like for the last year to have to

609
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
Sears Helena

610
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,864
And that's basically forever yeah yeah

611
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,984
Okay so for those of you guys who don't know the canary is an all-in-one security system at this little Lake

612
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,056
Black or white cylinder that you stick in your house

613
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,104
All these sensors in it

614
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,176
And a camera and now Canary you guys are

615
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,736
Introducing a whole bunch of new stuff so

616
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,808
Starting with everybody's favorite device and outdoor camera

617
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,344
Yay

618
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,440
That's right yeah we just announced this week the launch of canary Flex

619
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,488
Which is a companion products

620
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,792
To Canary and it's an indoor outdoor camera

621
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:48,192
It works plugged in or wire for Isa has built-in rechargeable batteries and it's totally weatherproof so you can use it

622
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,824
Spider house you can mount it up on a tree in your front yard you can put in the garage

623
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,152
Or you can use it inside in the baby's room or just like

624
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,944
The same way you would use Canary indoors

625
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
Okay so

626
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,296
There is like an outdoor camera zeitgeist

627
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
Right now

628
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:08,928
So you got to talk to me about why you guys decided on this particular

629
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,720
Product because

630
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,512
S&S has one

631
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,560
Netatmo is launching a new one

632
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,144
We just got the ring stick up cams out there

633
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,704
I'm trying out these are Lowe's I mean there's

634
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,008
There's a lot of outdoor cameras

635
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,288
Yeah when we launched

636
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
Canary a couple years ago

637
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,384
We're really interesting this idea of being

638
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,784
What's be connected on the inside of your home in and even if you're on the other side of the world feel like you're inside your home you know what's happening

639
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
And you have that

640
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,368
Immediate connection was happening there

641
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,976
I think as soon as people have gotten a taste of that either through Canary or through other Wi-Fi cameras

642
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,304
It just makes sense that they wanted to expand that into

643
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,864
Even more areas of places they care about

644
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
So it's an outdoor

645
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,936
Security camera but it's also

646
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,752
Just a very versatile camera that can go anywhere

647
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
It's our goal was really to

648
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,616
Take what people are already interested in which is

649
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,152
Can I give me places they care about

650
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
And allow that coverage

651
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,272
Ensure that connection to go wherever people really wanted to go

652
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:12,416
One of our core tenants has always been to really listen to our community when we launched a crowdfunding product

653
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,744
Community became really important to

654
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,864
Canary as a company we had about 10,000 people that were immediately kind of bought in and giving us feedback

655
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,680
And so as soon as we launched keryflex

656
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:29,568
Got a lot of feedback as far as what what it was doing for people and then what people wanted it to do for them that it wasn't doing yet

657
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,384
And one of those things that we heard kind of right away was

658
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,480
This desire to take it outside or two to put in other places which the product wasn't

659
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
Designed to do

660
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,808
All right

661
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Tumi

662
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:44,672
Not that I don't love outdoor cameras the most exciting thing that you guys are doing

663
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,976
Is launching a service Club membership

664
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
And

665
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
This is

666
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
This is

667
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:53,888
Security service in a lot of ways very similar to

668
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,984
Like 10 for storage on an ester ring or something like that

669
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,312
You guys are taking it a slightly different direction

670
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:05,664
With being able to reimburse people for their deductible

671
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,224
In any idea is much more proact

672
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
I'd love for you to describe

673
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
The thinking behind

674
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
Worship

675
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
Yeah absolutely right now with

676
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,416
With Wi-Fi cameras right now

677
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,952
Well a lot of what we're seeing is

678
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
Companies

679
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,072
Trying to compete with Who had who got the lowest price for a for video storage

680
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,888
Everytime recognizes more like you know we don't want to

681
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
That's not the game we want to compete at United mean

682
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,264
Baidu the idea of

683
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
Paying for storage

684
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
Yeah exactly

685
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,664
What is you guys design like

686
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,200
If that's your plan

687
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,224
How does membership

688
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
I feel that

689
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,040
We designed membership to really

690
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,088
Go against what all the other what other

691
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,160
Wi-Fi cameras are offering it's it's not based on

692
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,232
Video storage is based on benefits that

693
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,512
That are

694
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,792
Really designed to give you

695
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,328
Better security and

696
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,424
Have Canary work with you if you do have a security or an emergency incident

697
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,520
So that starts with a dedicated and incident support agent

698
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,824
So as a canary member we actually

699
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
We have dedicated

700
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,640
Supporting us that will work with you

701
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:12,736
2 and hold your hand really through if they're everything you need to do in the case of

702
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,272
You have your home burglarized

703
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:20,672
It's crazy because when we when we launched Canary we've seen we have discussion Hunter the discussions of people that have

704
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
Just had their home burglarized

705
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,048
You stay as I don't have any sexy have you ever

706
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,120
I don't even want to say it cuz what if someone shows up but

707
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,400
But yeah

708
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,448
As you might imagine it's very like

709
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,264
Scary and Adam Panos

710
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,616
It's a difficult situation to go to a people out of time people are kind of like scrambling to figure out

711
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:46,016
It what I do what's the what's the right steps how do I how do I manage this process you feel very like violated when it happens and so what we

712
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:49,088
One of the four things we designer Canary membership is how do we

713
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,368
Actually be an active

714
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,672
Participant wenzhou users and help them through that

715
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,208
How come to that process

716
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,744
So

717
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,048
So this this feature having a

718
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,704
Dedicated incident report person that we can actually hop on the phone with you and help you know here's the information needed

719
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
Connecticut police

720
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,568
Kira is at here's how you handle working with your insurance company

721
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,872
Especially walking through every step of that process

722
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,944
So before like right after I called nine-one-one I should call Kenny

723
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:21,856
Yeah I mean obviously the first thing you should you do it you should do is call 911 actually use the canary out to disconnect with the police

724
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,136
And then you know once

725
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,672
Once you do that will actually walk

726
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,512
Things you can do we can go in and help you you know

727
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
Access

728
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,328
Nav other information that you might

729
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,120
Need from the canary app as far as

730
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:36,448
You know exact timestamp when things happen

731
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,008
And then we can actually work if you have a really strong about

732
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
State Farm

733
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,616
And and other insurance agencies

734
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:48,480
So I can walk you through the best process of how you work with your insurance company and then on top of that we actually

735
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:52,832
Do as for Canary members we reimburse you for your insurance deductible

736
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:59,232
So you know that your insurance will cover everything after you pay your deductible will actually reimburse you for that deductible so if your

737
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,536
I'll miss burglarizing your Canary number

738
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,072
I'm going to be out of pocket

739
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
Anything that has well

740
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
Pepper that for you

741
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Okay

742
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
That's

743
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,264
That's an interesting idea because it feels like

744
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
The canary

745
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,360
The canary in a lot of these cameras not just connect

746
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
Feels like

747
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,480
Something I could use after I've been burglarized but not something that

748
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,248
Pitstop app

749
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,064
So what am I missing

750
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,184
Cuz I'm paying my deductible

751
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,744
Will not actually we're not even worried that you're going

752
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,864
Yeah it's it is interesting security companies I think have

753
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
Failed to come

754
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,728
Complete the circle of life protecting you before an incident

755
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,032
During an incident and after its incident

756
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,080
Often times it's only

757
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,360
Kind of like part of that

758
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
And so we've actually

759
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,688
Designed Canary in the canary

760
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:54,016
Experience to help you in all three of those cases so

761
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,296
It's before an incident

762
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,880
Can I give you an insight into what's happening your home let you be connected to your home

763
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,440
During an incident will send you a notification

764
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,512
Allow you to sound the siren that's built into the device

765
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,304
Connect to the police duty app

766
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,376
And then after the incident that's really working right memberships comes in

767
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,424
Are we helping you can't manage that process

768
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,752
That's really complaining that circle before during and after

769
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,288
The circular

770
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,104
Crisis I'm sure that's not your

771
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,176
How to say idea

772
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,992
I am fascinated by this idea

773
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:31,392
People who are building Hardware recognizing that iot is really about services and so I love membership because it's

774
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,184
A really interesting service

775
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,232
How did you guys go

776
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,072
Come to this idea that you needed to deliver a service or was it always there

777
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,888
I mean I think a lot of it is coming

778
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
Come to

779
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,472
Come from recognizing that

780
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,496
So many

781
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,544
Subscription plans that

782
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
Coming in not even just talking

783
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,360
In the

784
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,920
Subscription plans

785
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,712
Tech companies are usually about

786
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,760
How do we strip away some features

787
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,064
Put it behind a paywall somebody has to

788
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,136
Has to have a transactional relationship with us and pay us

789
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
You know what I mean

790
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:08,256
It's like how do we how do we make the free experience or product not good enough

791
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,304
They have to pay us so we here

792
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,584
Ensure

793
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,144
Yeah we're like

794
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
I mean

795
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
Most up

796
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,312
Most companies that do the state don't have like a son of a freemium

797
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,592
Then where

798
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,872
Shirley Spotify

799
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
Yeah like Spotify

800
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
Adam

801
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,760
Or even even other connected home cameras are products like

802
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:35,904
You know you have a little bit and then after a month all the sudden you like oh that's the product I bought I thought it was going to do all this other stuff

803
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:42,048
And we don't we don't want that kind of relationship with our customers we don't want to transactional relationship we actually want

804
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,632
A relationship where we're going to be there for you and help you and so

805
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,912
Service plans to us

806
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,192
We didn't want to come

807
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
Key.

808
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
Hayward's going to make

809
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
Cheaper and cheaper storage

810
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,848
But keep it behind a paywall to where you have to do it

811
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,384
What other things

812
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,944
Can we offer that would be meaningful that would actually

813
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:04,832
Frito-Lay relationship that exist longer than them purchasing us selling their products and then

814
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,392
Maybe it's hanging up paying us on a monthly basis

815
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,720
Cancel membership came from that it's like how do we actually

816
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:14,304
Hold hands with our users through things that could be difficult for them

817
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,144
It reminds me a lot of AAA so you could obviously drive a car

818
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
Without

819
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,936
Having a membership in

820
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
If you have it so

821
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Yeah yeah

822
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,568
Also underlying

823
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
The whole

824
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,360
Membership

825
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,712
Platform that we built is this idea of a Marketplace instead of underneath that right

826
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,296
That initially there's these three benefits that come

827
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,600
With membership for because it also

828
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Include

829
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,440
Stop 38th and video history and unlimited downloads

830
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,976
Now there is a storage

831
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,512
Yeah but it's like

832
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,072
You know we kind of take it off a table cuz it's like

833
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
Call

834
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,864
Is the whole month of

835
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
A video storage

836
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,192
I'm ready downloads no data caps

837
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:57,312
Add rat like tearing it like pay this much I pay this much more to get more storage just just

838
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,360
Built in there that's not really even

839
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,408
That's not the core focus of it

840
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,736
So with the marketplace are these going to be

841
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,016
Mostly security

842
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,344
Focused in oriented or is it going to also

843
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,928
Build upon Lake dictionary for example has air quality

844
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,208
And

845
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,744
Sensors in

846
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,536
I don't know what else you could build with that but

847
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,560
I'm sure someone's created

848
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,936
Yeah I mean there's really no limit to what they can be our our Focus

849
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,008
Has been out of the gate to make sure that we're offering

850
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,800
Time cover security that's been

851
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,336
Core focus our company

852
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,384
Manticore promised to our users

853
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,920
But if there's definitely

854
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,968
Potential in an opportunity to a lot

855
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,016
Opportunity to do a lot more

856
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:42,368
And I wish I could tell you everything we know that but there's definitely going to be some

857
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,184
More exciting things coming through the marketplace in the future

858
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
I

859
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
I cannot wait for that

860
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,744
So

861
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,304
Go it looking forward to

862
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
In your company

863
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,376
Your focus is on security

864
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
Usell

865
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:59,008
Couple pieces of Hardware you got your existing Canary you got the flex

866
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,056
Got some accessories to go with that

867
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,128
What percentage of your business is going to be

868
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,920
Services versus hard

869
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,480
Yeah I mean I think we should consider ourselves

870
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,040
In the services business PCS

871
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,880
Dabbing built a thing here that we can build

872
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
Continue to build upon

873
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,440
And really offer a lot

874
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
Tree services at Canobie

875
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,000
Corridor business

876
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,280
That being said

877
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,864
Where is very very design-driven Product Company

878
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,656
And the hardware is

879
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,216
Is just as important as anything else

880
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:33,824
We're not we're not in the business of how do we get how do we make cheaper and cheaper components

881
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:34,848
And then

882
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,408
And just tell those so that we can do services

883
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,480
It's really like all tied together for us like we're

884
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,760
We're committed to

885
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,552
Delivering really high quality

886
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,832
Hardware wood

887
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,856
Nazi from

888
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,928
All the companies in the states so that's something that's very important to us

889
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,208
We're very focused on

890
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,048
Doing a really great user experience through your mobile app

891
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,888
I'm in now with membership we're showing that we're going to level up some

892
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:01,728
Step up our game when it comes to Services Sarasota Trulia

893
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,520
All three of those things together for us

894
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:07,616
What would make in your mind membership successful like what kind of

895
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,200
I don't know acceptance rate among your users or

896
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,552
I have no idea what how are you going to judge the success of them

897
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Membership

898
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,928
We judge the success of a level lot of what we do

899
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,952
Bust through

900
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:27,584
Quantitative stuff but also qualitatively a lot and we spent a lot of time reaching out to

901
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
Our user base

902
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,424
That's a lot of the success in my mind is going to come from

903
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,240
Actually talking to our community and hearing from them

904
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,520
If we delivered

905
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,568
What we believe is a needs they have

906
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,104
We want to hear that from our users

907
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
With your products

908
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:46,784
I've got to ask this poem kid has become a bigger deal especially with the launch of iOS 10

909
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
And the home app

910
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,880
And you guys a couple months ago said that you

911
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,696
We're going to release a second-generation Canary product

912
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,976
It was homekit compatible

913
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,256
Yes yes

914
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
So

915
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,328
When can we expect that

916
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
Or do you want to give us an update

917
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
On the home

918
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,984
Sure sure yeah we are we have been working with apple on this actually

919
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,776
For a little while it's if it's been

920
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,544
Good

921
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,104
Fun process working with them as they've been

922
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:14,688
Trapping to announce if they recently did the home platform

923
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,784
We have the beginning of next year when we watching was called Canary Plus

924
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,112
Which is the next generation of the of our first

925
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
System

926
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:29,280
Entire place was going to be as a pumpkin chicken batter Bowl

927
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,584
And we think for at least at least

928
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,120
A subset of our users

929
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,400
I'm nothing to you

930
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,448
Kevin exciting and meaningful addition

931
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,544
Guess I'm sure it will be could you bridge from one Canary to the other

932
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
You're old Canary to the

933
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
Canary

934
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,664
What are there all accessible through the same

935
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,200
A map of course

936
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,736
Homekit

937
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,040
Ship that you're at the harborage if you put in the product

938
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,600
That makes it home kit accessible

939
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,952
Doesn't mean you can't pull in a video feed from a different

940
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,536
So I could I could see that one

941
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
Made in the home app

942
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,400
Which means I'll be hanging out

943
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
Still in the canary

944
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,984
In the flex camera

945
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
And is that

946
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,592
Careflex isn't at this time

947
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,384
Okay

948
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
Chine

949
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:22,784
Thank you so much for coming on the show I'm excited to see you guys evolved

950
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,088
We need to talk about computer vision

951
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,232
But it lets go back just one step

952
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,024
Cuz I I do want to actually

953
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,352
You guys have actually been one of the Pioneers in

954
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,632
Deep learning computer vision

955
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,912
To your camera Prada

956
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,984
And I remember training Maya camera

957
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
When I first tried this thing

958
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,592
For like weeks I was like that's my dog that's my dog

959
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
That's my dawg

960
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,688
I'm in the night I realized that wasn't it

961
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,992
Be at it for a while but now it's out

962
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,784
Side hurts your face

963
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
How does it how is

964
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,672
That playing out for your users

965
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,696
Something there is

966
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,464
Excited about

967
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:08,352
Yeah and what school actually what you were doing Stacy and and you were one of the thousands of people that were doing that

968
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:13,984
It wasn't just training your device that was actually training are back in system to recognize things that were

969
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,568
Caribbean clustered on the back end and needed labels but that's them

970
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,896
So what we've been doing from the beginning is

971
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,432
From when it first launched it is

972
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:26,784
Trying to have the system I learned identify and recognize patterns

973
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,832
In home environments that could then be

974
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,368
Filter out if they're not import

975
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,416
And so over the past few months

976
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,440
We watching a movie

977
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:38,560
Speakers some of them are user-facing and some of them just happened in the background to make the product better for our users

978
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,608
In a sentence

979
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,400
Has been really great as far as

980
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,192
Users noticing a difference getting

981
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,752
Fewer and fewer false alerts things that they're not in

982
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:51,104
And more attention to the things that they actually want to be notified about

983
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:00,319
Spider dog or for some people it cuz we haven't we actually built sensitivity slider that's in the app

984
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:04,159
I'm so some people actually took a slider over to where they get

985
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,207
Fewer alerts Madrid actually filter out

986
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
Pets

987
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,535
The canary actually caught my dogs

988
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
On my bed

989
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,655
That's good for you yet

990
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,447
Awesome okay
