00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,032
Hey everyone it is the Internet of Things podcast did I am your host

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,312
Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,592
And this is your co-host

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,616
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,432
We've got a great show for you today

6
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,224
If you are ready to just be

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,784
Just so scared of all the can

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,832
Connected devices to your home

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,112
Just so scared

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:26,880
Okay

11
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:27,648
So

12
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,976
We have iot security blows

13
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:31,744
IHOP

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,024
Couple stories

15
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:38,144
One is a non-story so we're going to briefly mention it and tell you not to worry

16
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
That is that

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,960
Your your nest device was

18
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,008
Transmitting your ZIP code

19
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,544
That you inserted in

20
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,824
Told the nest

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,152
So I can get weather information it was actually giving that to

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,480
Was called leaking this data in the

23
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
Packet header

24
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,016
Information

25
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:58,624
In some cases it was your ZIP code in some cases it was the zip code of the weather station

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,416
This has since been fixed

27
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696
The weather station

28
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,000
So don't worry about it

29
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
A lot of people were

30
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,584
Mine is deleting my personal data

31
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,144
Sunday morning

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
Is not anymore

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,520
It's not dated this particular personal there were some bad security practices such as

34
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
Putting that

35
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
Information in

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
But you know

37
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,200
Nest is no longer doing that hopefully they've learned a valuable lesson

38
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,808
But there is maybe a little bit of something more

39
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
Worrisome out there

40
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,464
This happened a couple of days back and I had never heard of this particular search

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
Vengeance I'm just going to say it and

42
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,048
If it's not familiar to you will explain what it is

43
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
It's showdown

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
Shodan

45
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,216
And apparently a search engine for like iot things

46
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,056
What you can do with show Dad is actually kind of scary you can

47
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Have it

48
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,432
Search for unprotected open webcams

49
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,064
Send their pictures of people's babies sleeping and so on that were found via show Dan in that

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
Really bad

51
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
Okay so

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,416
I'm going to do a quick reality check

53
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:10,304
This is going to be Stacy the geek talking as opposed to Stacy the worried mother of

54
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
So

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
Shootings been around since 2009

56
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,728
It is a search engine for connected devices

57
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,080
And for a long time people have used it as a way to

58
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,128
Find open ports on the internet

59
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
Check out

60
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,992
What they recently did was add an image search

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,576
And now you can actually search for sleeping babies

62
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
Yes

63
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,952
What you can also do is you go in and you don't actually

64
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
You actually have to

65
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,768
To type in passwords to

66
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
Kodak Kodak

67
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
Cameras and stuff

68
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
Usually it's

69
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,192
Basic default passwords for these things so like

70
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
Admin or password

71
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
Password one

72
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,800
Usually get you in a lot of these things

73
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,128
So it's maybe a little harder than you might

74
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
Think and

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,968
The other thing to know about shooting

76
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:04,320
And is it's not like just some sort of creepy like place where you can go see

77
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
Sleeping children

78
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
It's also kind of a neat

79
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,952
Place where you can go and see all these cool connected devices

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
If you're like

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
Myself

82
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,864
So I don't want it and I'm like a cool there's like weather stations you can

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
See your there's

84
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,704
View connected devices in

85
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,800
Actually one of our former colleagues yonko used it to track

86
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
Actually I think it was like

87
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
I was looking at app download

88
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
What's on Roku boxes

89
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
Is it again it is

90
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
It is like a Google for can

91
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
Connected devices

92
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
Right

93
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,064
That's just me

94
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,880
I know people are like

95
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
But

96
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
We don't have to freak out totally

97
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
Play freak out a little bit and change your password

98
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,072
I grew that I don't I don't think I should be freaking out it's just

99
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,608
Disconcerning number one

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,192
Mainstream people are not going to be going to this

101
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,800
Search engine in the end knowing what to do with it and so on it it's it's kind of the Geeks like awesome

102
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,872
I almost hesitated even bring it up but you know what I mean

103
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:06,272
Chances are people already know about the people who want to know about it already do so it's really I think the message here is to make sure that you

104
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,624
Your devices are secure as you can make them on the user side

105
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
And also from a

106
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
Turn a device maker standpoint

107
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:21,375
You know try and lock these things down give you some control some security control to the users make sure that it's not going through

108
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Open ports and such

109
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,471
This is a good time to bring up a couple things

110
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
Thanks Cuz also in his arse

111
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
On once you get past

112
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
Sleeping baby wipe

113
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,687
Such a nice-looking baby though I have to say

114
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479
Is it a nice looking baby

115
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
We can't see the

116
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
The baby

117
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
Light blanket in crib

118
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:48,511
It's a sleeping baby in Canada I didn't realize I was even going across the border here

119
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:55,679
So it's worth mentioning that we've had on the podcast folks from this group is called I Am the calvary

120
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,239
I'm here Josh Korman who is one of the

121
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
The founders effect

122
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,871
Since it's a bunch of security researchers and they actually

123
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
2014 released

124
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,223
Anything about connected vehicles in

125
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,503
It was a framework

126
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
They created with

127
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,623
The industry with the government in the whole goal was to

128
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,927
Kind of come up with again a framework

129
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,231
For how we should think about securing connect

130
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Vehicles

131
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,071
And what they're doing actually is creating one for the Internet of Things

132
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
Which is been a long time

133
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,167
In the story in ours that willing to in the show no

134
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,031
Has a bunch of really awesome stuff in there so we're going to have to get

135
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
Them back on the show

136
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,615
The guy who's doing this is Brian nox

137
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,431
Have to have them come and talk about what they're doing here

138
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
It's pretty sweet

139
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
And with you

140
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:46,111
Took bunch of best practices that are in consumers interest here with internet security and privacy in

141
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
I do remember the I am the cavalry

142
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
Creed or Mantra that they

143
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
Check offering a couple years back and

144
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
I think it's great neck that's long overdue

145
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
That's ultimately

146
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
Picture here is Sweeney Todd

147
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,679
I need to start locking the stuff down a little bit better as an industry

148
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
Yeah and

149
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Is all others

150
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,823
She's a little bit there's three under security so it's secure by default

151
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
So

152
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,407
No default password share between devices

153
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Advanced features

154
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
That are used by only a few users should be turned off

155
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
That's under secure by default

156
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Then you have

157
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
Secure by Design

158
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,159
And that's things like sperm or should be locked down

159
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:24,511
Other memory and storage nand memory storage medium should be protected with

160
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,839
Epoxy ball socket so the memory can't be removed in.

161
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
Obzedat's physical security

162
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
On the actual silica

163
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Security is selca

164
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,335
So the devices should not rely on the network

165
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
Provide security

166
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Rather

167
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
The devices

168
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Security model

169
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
Summa Network

170
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
If the cloud goes down you don't want your devices on

171
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,367
Secure insecure because the clouds down

172
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
Bright

173
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,207
So those are under security and then there's some

174
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
There's four things for privacy

175
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,679
Quibble I think when we get them on the show talk about this but kind of privacy they have consumer Pi is not shared with manufacturers

176
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,775
Partners usage data on individual consumers is never shared with

177
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Advert

178
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,919
Anonymous data for buckets of users on usage patterns is acceptable

179
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,271
As long as it's proven but not traceable back to the individual consumers

180
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,903
And then for data collection policy type of data collected in usage of data

181
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,695
Is clearly documented

182
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
On-site

183
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,303
So what's your quivalizer curiosity I know we'll get them on the show an answer

184
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
What is it

185
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,911
Well so it kind of the framework addresses this a little bit but

186
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,775
Buddhist concept of consumer pii which is personally identifiable information

187
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,871
I think that's kind of an archaic notion in a world where we have

188
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
Such advanced

189
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Data mining

190
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,039
Because you can basically identify a person

191
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,367
From about three or four pieces of information has been kind of

192
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
Consistently proven

193
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
And so

194
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
I feel like Pi I could be really anything

195
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
Now in

196
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
3 they say

197
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,631
Anonymous data for buckets of users

198
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,447
Can't be traceable back to individual

199
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,495
Consumers which kind of takes care of

200
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,823
So maybe that's okay but it a lot of

201
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
Like laws are written

202
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
And they they just

203
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,687
Shove pii

204
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
And I'm kind of like

205
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
Okay but I hear you

206
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,135
Two-level said everybody this is not the final version of

207
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
Are the criteria this is preliminary

208
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
That brand Nelson in the group is not

209
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
Formally

210
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,631
I guess there was like a public with cuz obviously it's available but they're still working on this

211
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
Yes and

212
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
You know it is just a frame

213
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
You know it's not like

214
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,799
They they call themselves I am the cavalry

215
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
It's not like the horses are

216
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
Come charging out in anyone with anything

217
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,455
They also do note in the story

218
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
Which I'm really sad

219
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Again

220
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,807
I'm really sad that the story like

221
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
If you don't read all the way down you're going to miss

222
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,159
A lot of really great stuff because

223
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,255
They talk about the ftce starting to consider how they're going to like

224
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
Are they going to do civil fines for this witch

225
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
All the way back

226
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,655
In 2013 when the FTC was looking at this

227
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
You know they had

228
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
People talking to them saying

229
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,031
Dude this isn't going to be secure and you

230
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
Find people

231
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
You know the rest into

232
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,967
And you know the people who are on the panel advocating for this for sale

233
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
Is it there's going to be nothing else

234
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
Do you need a stick

235
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,599
Yeah beat people with a stick because right now

236
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
Consumers don't pay for privacy

237
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
And they don't

238
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
Manufacturers

239
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
They have no incentive to

240
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
Put it in there

241
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
Tyranitar

242
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
And it's expensive

243
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
How to track an

244
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Keep that going south

245
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,959
I'm not going to say regulation is the answer to everything cuz it certainly isn't

246
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
But

247
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
I can't think of anything else that can keep

248
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
The manufacturers in line

249
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
So I don't

250
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
Have a problem with this

251
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
Yet

252
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:58,271
If the FTC does really get involved depending on the details and what they're going to do obviously

253
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,159
What else is there

254
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,695
I mean the cost of your devices

255
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
All right

256
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,887
It's in everyone's best in

257
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,239
Because once we get past this like oh my God it's not secure

258
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
People normal people may feel more Trust

259
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
And by the

260
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,383
Okay sorry

261
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,455
I said we were moving along then what did I do I kept talking about it

262
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
That's all right

263
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,599
It's because I can't find my way back to Archie two things were still talking about

264
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
Cute cards

265
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,695
Cue cards Cayenne it's so hot right now

266
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
All right

267
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
So

268
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
I've been talking Kevin you talk for a little while.

269
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:50,239
Sure we literally out and talk about my devices not stay safe devices not my devices but

270
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:55,615
The company called my devices. Com they have some news out today that they were recording a show

271
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:02,015
I think they actually pronounce this in the past but I'm not 100% sure on that or what they've done is they are launching kayak

272
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,087
I am the world's first and I don't know if it's true but

273
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,159
It is a drag-and-drop iot project Builder

274
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:12,767
Not sure on the whole world's first bit don't think it is actually say she never talked about it before the show

275
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,607
Essentially this is very specific to Raspberry Pi devices

276
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,471
And that's interesting to me because I because I have a Raspberry Pi but be because

277
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
It's an affordable solution you can use it

278
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,335
For prototyping you don't need to have a ton of money to

279
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Develop

280
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,175
I have two devices if you can use a pie and some other things such as

281
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,991
List some Dragon drop iot project Builder

282
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
Essentially

283
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
When is a dragon drop

284
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
This is a bunch of

285
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Widgets

286
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Tekken

287
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:45,023
Be viewed on a website or a mobile device through iOS or Android have an app coming it's a dashboard it's a dashboard

288
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,095
Set of sensors are reading data from sensors that are attached

289
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,631
Perhaps to your Raspberry Pi

290
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
You know it's

291
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,983
A low-cost way to I think development

292
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
A10 create

293
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
Iot devices so

294
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
I think it's interesting

295
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
Worth trying

296
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
I will say it looks a lot like

297
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
Freeboard

298
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,479
Rio from bug labs

299
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,319
Which is actually the developer platform that Verizon is using in it

300
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,903
Things space Cloud but other people can use it to sew

301
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,511
Looks like that the GUI interface that it has kind of reminds me of node red

302
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
So

303
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,887
And again I like all of this stuff so

304
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,215
Yes make it easier for everyone to play with the inter

305
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,287
So we like to Tinker so I'm in

306
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,615
You know something that's cheap and easy to use that we can just go

307
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,175
Have fun with for a couple hours on a weekend

308
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
Looks like that kind of thing to me so I'm excited

309
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
Yasso

310
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
Music let us know what you think

311
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
And

312
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
I will say

313
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,159
You know what we should talk about though

314
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,231
Now what we should talk about this because it happened

315
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
A week ago

316
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
But after we were

317
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
Recorded the show but Amazon did some news and this one actually doesn't relate to she who shall not be named

318
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
This is

319
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,983
Is Dash replenishment

320
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
Service

321
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
So everyone knows

322
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Does the Dasher

323
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
You don't know

324
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,895
There are probably some

325
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,223
You guys out there I'm sure there are never seen a dash button

326
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,063
You know I've actually never seen a dash button believe it or not cuz I don't have anything yet

327
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,623
All Dash buttons

328
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:20,511
I'm your pretzel there internet-connected and it automatically orders one item so

329
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,071
A specific item that is pictured on the dash bus

330
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,399
But it also has something I'm far more significant

331
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,495
Which is the dash replenishment service which is basically just a

332
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
It's a backend

333
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,103
Cloud replenishment service to Amazon

334
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
E-commerce

335
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
System so

336
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
What it is is

337
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,551
If you're a manufacturer like brother printers

338
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
You

339
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,111
Basically have a sensor

340
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
And some code that connects

341
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
To Amazon's backend

342
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
And

343
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,559
When that sensor detects like that you're out of ink

344
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
In a Brother printer

345
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
It just

346
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,423
Calls Amazon it says yo I'm out of ink

347
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,215
In Amazon

348
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
Yeah I ate so it's it's kind of like a

349
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,431
The dash button from cells I think they were like $5 or whatever

350
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,759
Date of Easter Focus towards consumers you buy one like maybe the

351
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:20,159
The tide wasn't sticking on your washing machine when you're running though you just hit the button and more time is on its way

352
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,975
Getting disintegrated into actual products where it makes sense

353
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,511
Cenotes a totally different play

354
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:29,119
I like this better I think than the manual press the button for consumers just order one thing

355
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
It's a very specialized

356
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:35,519
Integrated Service say with the Brother printer that use bait you use as an example

357
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
So here's where I'm going to blow your mind

358
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
Hello my mind go for it

359
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,199
So this is for consumers this could be for businesses

360
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,247
But it really just takes

361
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Sensor

362
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
And

363
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:53,951
Like 10 lines of code is what Amazon tells me last week they open this program up

364
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
Anyone

365
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
So if you are

366
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
A big-time developer like it

367
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
GE which has a smartwatch

368
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Machine

369
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
Dance to this

370
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,935
Or you're like a hobbyist like myself

371
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,727
And let's say you have like

372
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
I don't know a Raspberry Pi

373
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,079
And a sensor and you want to build like

374
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,127
I would love to build a connected dog food thing

375
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:18,527
Instead of buying my own so you could actually this is open enough that you could grab the code yourself and put it on your pie with a sin

376
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
Answer to your dog bowl

377
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,367
Basically or my dog probably my dog feeder

378
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
Food storage

379
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
I got you I got

380
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,839
The giant Tupperware

381
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,655
So exactly

382
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
You could do this

383
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
I could do this

384
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
For big companies

385
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
She is doing this

386
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
So yes

387
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,383
So that I thought was really freaking sweet

388
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,687
What are the big companies are already involved

389
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
So Brita

390
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,783
They're doing it for their water

391
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,367
Samsung's one I think Samsung is one

392
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,159
There's a company called G mate

393
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:00,767
Which makes a smart blood glucose monitor which will reorder

394
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
The little

395
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
Prickly things in the

396
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
Testing strips

397
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
Spritz little

398
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
Glucose monitor Purell

399
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,471
Four hand sanitizer things

400
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,055
Cleverpet I don't know if you saw my CES video where

401
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,359
Play with the cleverpet device

402
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
I'm it's a pet food

403
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
August

404
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
The lock company

405
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,271
Which embedding is batteries but I do

406
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,319
For sure that make sense

407
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Sealed air

408
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
I'm not sure what field are is going to

409
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,463
I don't know

410
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,095
So there's a lot of companies and hopefully we'll start seeing a lot more because it was a close program for now

411
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:41,471
I'm so so I know who I want to see integrated this thing and that is the folks make the

412
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,031
Keurig coffee machines

413
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
Always run out

414
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
And then I'm kind of

415
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
That would be interesting because

416
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,711
You have to do it on your storage

417
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:57,087
Pod correct it wouldn't be in the coffee maker have to be wherever the storage pods or maybe they make like a

418
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,903
A little container for those and monitor it and

419
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
You keep taking them out

420
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,487
Recognize

421
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
Hey that would be cool

422
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
So Kevin

423
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,351
You can actually

424
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,631
Temecula

425
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Scale

426
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,215
Weekend project

427
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,311
See we get too excited about this dividing people

428
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,359
Because I freak people out about that Nina

429
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
We probably free

430
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
Just anybody

431
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,759
I thought was worth noting

432
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,783
So why do a couple

433
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
Quick newsie items

434
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,367
And then we'll end on a question

435
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,647
For everyone to think about

436
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
Alright Sony

437
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,255
Is buying Altair which is a Moto Maker for a 200

438
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
$12

439
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,911
Cuz it was 212 I would have paid sooner 13in

440
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:48,287
You're like I want to go to make sure I don't know why I want to have a Semiconductor Company

441
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,871
One for you and one for you

442
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:59,551
LG modems are basically cellular

443
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,879
Is there really useful for The Internet of Things presumably

444
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,927
What do you think Sony is going to do with this

445
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
Put modems in

446
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,743
What cameras

447
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
You know

448
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
I don't know I mean

449
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,119
So he's actually been struggling on the mobile side

450
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
These days they do pretty much

451
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
I want to say

452
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Onda

453
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,519
Camera sensor market for mobile devices but it says I think that's actual

454
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
Pretty accurate is everybody uses

455
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,127
Most many many major manufacturers use them

456
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,663
They're not doing well in smartphones

457
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
Tablets

458
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Xiamen

459
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,783
Is this the kind of modem that could integrate into say

460
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,367
System-on-a-chip from somebody else other than Qualcomm cuz right now these Qualcomm

461
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Yeah they can

462
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
What about for VR

463
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,839
I mean would you use that you would want to use sedative for

464
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,935
Alright well we'll throw that up as a

465
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,543
We'll have to do something and let's let's do something and think about it somewhere I'm curious what they might do with us

466
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
Yeah I mean

467
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
I can

468
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,431
Connecting anything with lenses for computer vision would be really powerful

469
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Okay

470
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
Johnson Controls

471
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Band Tycho

472
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
We're like what

473
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,391
So this is an industrial internet

474
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,695
Also worth noting because

475
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,023
Johnson Controls competes with Honeywell

476
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
Competes with

477
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:20,191
A lot of Honeywell GE etcetera on the smart building side and it had kind of an old-school

478
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:24,031
Kind of smart building automation software package called medisys

479
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,591
It was a little bit more closed off

480
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,151
Meanwhile Tyco they actually own

481
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,479
Faucets I can never pronounce it but it's a line of smart home sensors

482
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
And they also had

483
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
Their own

484
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,343
Kind of it's called Tyco on

485
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Which was a

486
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,903
Much more open

487
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,695
Fire & Security pack

488
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
CH4

489
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Against

490
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
Building automation

491
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,815
Let 3rd party integrators

492
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
Integrate with them

493
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,375
And so I'm really excited about this

494
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,423
2 million dollar deal

495
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,983
And it's kind of a cool deal

496
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
In that

497
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
I'm hoping

498
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,127
We see Johnson Controls take a page from Tycho

499
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
An open up

500
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,967
It's also worth talking about only because

501
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
I'm really curious

502
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,039
This still makes me think about

503
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:11,903
The overlap between the operational side of building automation solake

504
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
All the sensors

505
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,743
In the facilities management aspects of it

506
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,303
And how that's going to bridge with the it side

507
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
Because

508
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,887
Both of these are very traditional

509
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
Operational companies oot

510
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:28,287
And I'm like

511
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,359
Or do they partner to get it

512
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Because

513
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
A big rival of there

514
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,943
GE has been

515
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,735
Find databases

516
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
Bind database

517
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
Companies in

518
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,575
I'm kind of getting Cloud expertise

519
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
In building that up

520
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
Itself

521
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,183
Do they need to spend the money

522
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,023
To get the expertise the GE has or can you partner to get it

523
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
Where does that kind of

524
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
Need to take place

525
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Thoughts

526
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,959
But that's not the question we want to leave you

527
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
No it's not

528
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
It's a good question

529
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
So

530
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
The question was it

531
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:06,943
The last show we talked about the potential for smaller Amazon echos

532
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,015
Yes Echo Junior

533
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
We don't know any

534
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Baby

535
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,928
We don't know anything more about other than reports that it's coming

536
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,000
Should be about the size of a beer can can't tell if it's a 12

537
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
16 answer

538
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,584
But we were talking about how we wanted that

539
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,656
In the house in different rooms because of the voice activation

540
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
What do we have interesting

541
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Comment

542
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:33,056
Flash question from Brian one of our listeners he says

543
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,360
Regarding the smaller Amazon Echo

544
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,920
The wearable seems like a better solution

545
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:44,320
The Siri function on the Apple watch is activated by a gesture which is slightly less creepy than always listening function

546
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,136
And still more convenient than hitting a button which

547
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
The

548
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,976
Portable Amazon Echo report illegal have to hit a button

549
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,256
If it's not.

550
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
Turning batteries

551
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,584
And he says princess

552
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
Also not confined to a room or a

553
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:03,264
Building and you know when I when I saw that I'm liking what Bryant that is a really good point not one that I have thought of

554
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,336
You could Amazon or does Amazon these are they thinking about

555
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
Kooding

556
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,712
Amazon voice Services until wearable that people would want to buy and where

557
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,040
And it's kind of a tough market for that right now if you're not a

558
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:20,672
Google or an apple or Microsoft because you got the whole software platform that

559
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,464
Typically goes along with that and

560
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,536
You know Amazon doesn't have that they forked Android

561
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
So that way they can have the

562
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
Fire stuff

563
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,608
There's no

564
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,912
Android Wear from Google that they can

565
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
In 4 coming out

566
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,776
That's kind of propriety everything that's not as open as Android itself

567
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,848
I don't know how they would do that but you know what if you could

568
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
Find a way to get

569
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,432
The echo voice services on your wrist

570
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,968
It is less creepy

571
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,528
Especially when you can just you know it's not always listening

572
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:52,928
And forget the apps you just do it through cloud services I'm thinking if it's an interesting point that Brian makes it where you think

573
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
So you could because

574
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
You can actually

575
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,072
Add Alexa voice services to

576
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Other

577
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,376
Amy the Amazon Hazmat test

578
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
2K available so you could

579
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
Put it on

580
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
Device

581
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
It just

582
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
And it doesn't have to

583
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,384
So if Brian if you're really like excited about this idea you can make it

584
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Meeting

585
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,272
Tens of dollars on Kickstarter I don't know

586
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,112
I should have worn Brian Stacy is very good at giving homework assignments

587
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,160
It's true

588
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
Hallmark

589
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
I would buy one

590
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
Yeah

591
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
Caveat there

592
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
So

593
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,352
I like this idea

594
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,960
If it's actually I wear at Pebble and people have told me it looks like a medical device on my way

595
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,264
Wrist though

596
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,312
Yeah yeah yeah so if you have

597
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,128
I mean that's the nice thing about an SDK

598
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
It's not as

599
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,688
Maybe nice is an API but

600
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,224
And you can add it to a lot of

601
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
So

602
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
It's not

603
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,576
Crazy talk

604
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
To Envision

605
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
Something like that

606
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:58,208
Knowing and it might give people more of a purpose to

607
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,256
To buy such a wearable because right now

608
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,536
Just my observation

609
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
Smart watches

610
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,144
Yes sales are growing but it's not taking off I don't think the way people attic

611
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
Expected and

612
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
The third-party apps are just

613
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,752
It's not there yet there isn't

614
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,592
A ton of reasons to go and get this type of accessory for your wrist

615
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,872
Holy cow

616
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,920
I just realized

617
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,200
What you could put

618
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,528
Alexa voice services on a drone

619
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,088
You could build a skill

620
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,112
And you could call it back

621
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,928
Do you actually would have to go to school you could just call the Drone back to

622
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
How awesome would this be

623
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
That would be cool

624
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,840
I'm good I'm in the

625
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,888
There's lots of potential here and then

626
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,984
You know this is why I keep saying Amazon I think it's one of the best

627
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,520
Position companies

628
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Spore

629
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,592
I'll sail East consumer Internet of Things

630
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,224
Am I pretty

631
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,528
I have an idea Stacy

632
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
You could make one

633
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,928
Homework 2 Chainz

634
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,464
More I get more assignments

635
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
From Kevin

636
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,536

He is actually going to talk about

643
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
Ux

646
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:37,536
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

647
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,072
And I have Whitney Scott

648
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
Jensen

649
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,376
Hi Scott how are you

650
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
I'm fine thank you

651
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,728
And Scott is a ux designer

652
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,032
For the Chromecast team at Google

653
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:53,152
And Scott is gracious enough to join us not because he's going to talk to us about Google

654
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
But because he

655
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,760
Writes a lot of really good stuff as a designer

656
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,296
On the Internet of Things

657
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,600
So getting started let's talk about kind of

658
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,880
What's wrong with the boring bits

659
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
Let me sell it to you guys

660
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
Let's talk about

661
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,464
What happened

662
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,768
When we start connecting our houses

663
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,560
We spent a lot of time talking about like

664
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,840
Hey

665
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,168
Really cool things we can do I talk about my lights all the time

666
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,264
You guys are told me to stop talking about my lights all the time so Scott here is going to talk about

667
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,312
Saving money

668
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Let's do it Scott

669
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:26,432
So excited by the end of the things they instantly go to the hole

670
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
Automation side effects

671
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:33,088
Excited about is what the iot enables

672
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
Base level

673
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,184
So

674
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,328
Your house so that you only have power at the outlets and the ceiling for lights you can replace all the wiring to your switches

675
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,632
And you wouldn't even know is my auntie house

676
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:50,240
But it'll be probably 40% cheaper on

677
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
Listen to get so excited

678
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,848
And I think that's in a course you could do peyote like things

679
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:02,016
Turn on 17 lights

680
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,856
I was seeing you hate this concept of a digital Butler

681
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,904
You're like forget cheese I think

682
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,952
What is either the title or subtitle in one

683
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,768
Jesus must go

684
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
Viz idea is that

685
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
We are

686
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
So excited

687
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,888
About the idea of automation

688
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
And the factory

689
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,240
That we don't really appreciates

690
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
Weather makes sense

691
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,824
I just think that humans are

692
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
Sponge

693
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,896
Poetic Nessie

694
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,712
We can't be reduced down to 15 if then else clause

695
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:39,648
And there's so many things that people try to do that break down so I just think we need to have a little bit more

696
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
Humanitarian

697
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,304
Treat this with respect it deserves and there's lots of ways you can talk about

698
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,168
True I once spent probably a good for week

699
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
Trying to

700
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:55,520
Creative mode change an automatic mode change in my

701
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,568
For go to sleep

702
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,616
And it started with like a simple

703
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,896
When I turn off

704
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
In my house

705
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,992
About to sleep

706
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Because

707
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,880
I would turn off those lights but my husband would be downstairs reading and then all the lights

708
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
So then I was like okay

709
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,536
When those lights go out plus there's no motion downstairs

710
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
15 minutes

711
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,096
And that didn't work

712
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
Because he'd be watching

713
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
So then I was like

714
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,216
Downstairs

715
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,240
And

716
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,776
It's after a certain time

717
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
Like a really late time

718
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,592
I didn't work for whatever reason

719
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,664
When I read your diatribe against

720
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
Digital Butler

721
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,040
Yes that's exactly because it never it never came to pass that I could

722
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,344
I could program a digital Butler

723
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,904
Or like an automation for this mode change

724
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,256
You're right humans are messy and it might work like 4 nights out of the way

725
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
But those other three it was

726
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,864
Absolutely aggravating for

727
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,912
Either him or me or

728
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,472
Maybe my daughter when she was sick and

729
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,520
You know trying to find us in the middle of the night

730
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,568
Lights were coming on ER

731
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,616
Good morning setting was coming on and she

732
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
In the morning and I feel sick and

733
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,504
DeSoto what's the saying good morning

734
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,296
Weathersby

735
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
In the coffee pot starts Brewing

736
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
Its 3

737
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:22,304
Forget or don't appreciate that with automation comes lack of concern

738
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:28,192
And it's usually even though it works 90% of the time you have to work 35% of the time

739
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:32,032
To be in your house and you have no control isn't terrible feeling

740
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,080
And so that's why I'm a big

741
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:40,480
Follower of Douglas engelbart who wrote years ago

742
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
An argument

743
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:45,600
That I think that we need to think about our houses as having different

744
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,160
Types of systems

745
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,952
Coeur d'Alene is fairly simple.

746
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:54,048
No one's going to get too upset before wedding comes on

747
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,400
What's ceiling

748
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,960
Or happy

749
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,312
The intention was to be a little bit more

750
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
Humanitarian

751
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,128
If no one's around

752
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,688
Then it should

753
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:15,296
Actually warned you work send a video to your phone or use voice commands Ark

754
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,320
Something so

755
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,696
Augmentation base system

756
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
Magic

757
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
I'm in control

758
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
Interesting

759
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,472
A lot about and you tweet a lot about is this idea

760
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,008
Identity and

761
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,800
Devices having identities

762
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,080
And basically

763
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,248
Because right now a lot of things

764
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,296
Connected devices are signed to

765
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,576
You was a person

766
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,600
And not like

767
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,624
Your family

768
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,976
Which would be probably preferable since that's tends to be who lives in houses

769
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,816
And you were telling me before the show that your house actually now has

770
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
Gmail account

771
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
Which

772
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,728
I would think the only thing I can come up with because if I'm going to hardwire

773
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
Smart lights

774
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:11,872
It's one thing to have an Alexa with you that's fine

775
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,408
So there's a rule on this show

776
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,432
Because so many of

777
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,736
So many of our listeners have an Amazon Echo

778
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
We cannot say her name

779
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
She is she who shall not be

780
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,136
Of course sorry about that

781
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,816
Amazon

782
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,912
Requires an account

783
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,472
With my email account so when I sell my house

784
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,032
What do

785
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,736
No sense

786
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
Printing a house

787
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
Email account

788
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,392
Gold Exchange the

789
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,696
Passwords on the Gmail account and

790
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,024
They will have access to everything and it'll work out of the box now

791
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,072
I'm not happy with the solution

792
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,936
I did Lutron

793
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,240
Light switches and they were actually design

794
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
The ground up

795
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
To convey with a house

796
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,872
So there is an account associated with Neutron

797
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,432
They're not associated with the switch themselves

798
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
Which

799
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,784
With the thermostat

800
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
I have

801
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,136
Actually had to learn how to reset the nest

802
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,208
Thermostat in my ecobee thermostat just so

803
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,232
EBay

804
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,304
And I was actually a debate we had actually couple years ago was like

805
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,888
If you spend $250 on one of these thermostats

806
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,424
Is that something that you

807
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,728
Take out and take with you or do you

808
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:46,080
In your house and then do you how do you

809
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,384
Say that to the owner that they now have to

810
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
Connect to thermostat they have

811
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:54,784
Think about your dishwasher your washing machine

812
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
It send

813
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,624
Yeah I was at CSN

814
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,952
And I was like oh like your Amazon account

815
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
And ordering their own

816
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
Stop

817
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,840
So imagine imagine the paperwork that goes with your new house now

818
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,800
Best part of the issue is it and how much it has to get reset because again I feel like this layering is

819
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,088
You think that we want to

820
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,904
Have some type of nuanced iot

821
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
Closed system concept

822
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,488
So that doesn't work

823
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,816
See certain devices now anything that requires

824
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:45,216
External control obviously sugar

825
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,008
Twerking in some kind of closed

826
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,800
Mechanism

827
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,104
And I don't think we talked about that enough

828
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,384
Let's think about this

829
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
Because

830
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,432
There's a couple different ways

831
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
You build a closed loop system

832
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
Around

833
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
The physical place

834
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
Like the house

835
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
Much like you have

836
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,696
Your power so your power is associated with

837
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,720
Your physical address

838
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
So you have to think about

839
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,584
Who's going

840
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,608
To manage that

841
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,656
Aarhus kind of the guarantor

842
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
Behind that right

843
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
Or I don't know how you would think

844
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,544
What you going to pay my relationship and you got to deliver relation

845
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
So the power comes in

846
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,664
Right in the end of everything work

847
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,368
The payment with delivery of control

848
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,184
Okay great

849
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
So then

850
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,744
So in this closed system

851
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
Possible

852
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,840
Maybe those are the same thing maybe they're not

853
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,888
Cuz I think we got to figure out

854
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Right

855
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,704
Figure out what devices

856
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
Makes sense in that

857
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
Physical space

858
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,336
So light switches make sense

859
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,616
Do thermostats

860
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,664
Do dishwashers

861
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
MN

862
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,248
What other relationships are you going to have with them

863
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
Because like

864
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,576
And then how did those get managed

865
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
We can talk about

866
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,560
You can talk about my life

867
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:21,728
Wired and certain ways you could somehow create a closed loop

868
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
When these things are built

869
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,824
Together they each other in such a way that

870
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,944
There's are fine in their permanent than you bring in a new Samsung microwave and you wanted to communicate

871
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,552
Vanessa will call Nicole the Multi-Device Direct

872
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,648
Working America

873
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,976
And I want you to come to my house

874
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
I want you to unlock

875
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,792
The door by don't want you to accept

876
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
My file system

877
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:54,752
And again right now the answer is just giving you no account and you're done but it supposed to sing

878
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,568
Here's a residence of yours the owners of yours the kids

879
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:01,664
I need the controls that might survive the house being sold

880
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
Right

881
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
And So It Goes

882
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,576
Control and you sell the house

883
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:17,024
And I don't think it would talk about this act like how can we do what we funded for you and step it up a level

884
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,560
To actually provide

885
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,120
Access

886
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,144
Beyond belief

887
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:32,640
Pull a lot of now I see a lot of that happening at the network level so like I see a lot of companies

888
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,432
Adding data access layer

889
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
Would like a Wi-Fi router

890
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,272
In software accompanying the Wi-Fi router

891
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
Yeah

892
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,088
So that that is like a

893
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,368
Cited trend

894
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
What is happening

895
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,672
So

896
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,464
You know and being able to say

897
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,768
If you're a guest you have access

898
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,304
The following devices

899
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
You have access

900
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,096
Cast of The Following

901
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
Whatever permission

902
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
Which is very much what happens like

903
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
Corporate

904
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,104
Define gas

905
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,664
And then there for Augusta.

906
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,456
I said this and by default you are a guest

907
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:11,296
And that's quite a simplistic model that but it's so easy to break out of the gas

908
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,344
Open my front door

909
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,880
How do we handle a problem

910
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
Brain okay

911
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,488
I guess you could create different Airbnb guest verses

912
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,328
Hunting opportunities for identity broker

913
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:28,448
Stop being so for example Airbnb could easily become the Facebook of home automation in the sense that

914
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,288
If you had all devices can support Airbnb accounts and then you can just

915
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,616
Bill's got access in Beaumont to go but

916
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,944
Single monolithic identity

917
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
Struggling with

918
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:48,160
How do we have a Federated identity system so that you could

919
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,696
Poltergeist people

920
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,488
Well yeah because

921
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,304
There's identity for the people

922
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
Like there's my identity

923
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,632
Which changes obviously

924
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,704
Depending on where I am but there's also the device identity

925
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
And commission

926
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,520
And those are very different

927
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,824
And I know that I mean there's

928
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,688
Airbnb is working with various I want to say it's working with August but maybe

929
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,712
A different

930
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,760
Home company working with

931
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,040
August or a difference

932
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
Lock Company

933
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,672
Kevo perhaps I can't remember to create these kind of like

934
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
You know permissions

935
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,280
So like when you sign up

936
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,352
For Airbnb then you automatically get

937
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
Codes

938
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,912
Which is very happy

939
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,496
But yeah that is like

940
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
Pacific Market

941
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,760
Manufacturers of door locks

942
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,112
Say things like where you can give a key to your

943
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
House cleaner

944
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,928
And you know they can get in

945
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:58,560
Delegate

946
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,120
What's up

947
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
I'm questioning

948
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
I'm just questioning

949
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:05,984
What am I

950
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,776
What am I more famous

951
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:11,104
Articles talk about this idea of value greater than pain

952
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,176
Desiigner as long as

953
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,712
You know you'll do something

954
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:21,088
The problem is that's awesome painter sohi

955
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,880
Are nice things early valuable

956
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Do it

957
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,072
Ramblin the space part of it is

958
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,608
I don't think you'll appreciate

959
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,424
Be quiet

960
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,240
Yeah cuz if you had like Universal standard

961
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,520
You could have like

962
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,568
A way to implement

963
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,360
Permissions with your life

964
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,152
Unlock code with your door

965
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,944
Which would be really interested

966
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,224
So

967
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,344
When you got your key from a Kevo or an August or whomever

968
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
Along with that

969
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,952
You could unlock a variety of experiences

970
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
You could customize as the

971
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,072
Omar you can customize that users access

972
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
As you were getting them

973
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,400
But that would require

974
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,984
The door lock company to build that experience

975
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,800
It would require some sort of standardization

976
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,592
Across all of their connect

977
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
Two devices

978
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,384
That would be awesome

979
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,456
It would be and I think of you are probably taking

980
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,992
One of the more difficult problems

981
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:25,344
And important part of my

982
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,744
Which is simplified wiring automated lighting

983
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,096
Things like that that would be really really valuable and not near me

984
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,656
So that's where I think

985
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,960
Appreciate

986
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,128
True

987
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,408
Let's pick a less

988
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,456
Problem I've already using

989
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
The wiring is

990
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,808
I'm assuming you're talking about things like Bluetooth lights

991
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,856
For getting rid of wiring

992
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
Yes

993
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,352
I'm going to to Bluetooth

994
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
Classic license

995
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
Baby always

996
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
You're going to

997
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,824
I am considering that right now

998
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,872
Jefferson Township

999
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,968
I'd like I'm Pro Lutron light switch

1000
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,016
Although it's an old school standard

1001
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,904
And I use them to replace light switches where

1002
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,744
No light switch it says so I don't have to go into the walls and say

1003
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
Hello

1004
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,840
Let me do it expensive renovation project in my brand new home

1005
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,656
So I'm already taking advantage of the boring bits

1006
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
Yay

1007
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
Okay

1008
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
So thinking about

1009
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
Other

1010
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,264
Small problems

1011
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
Sore

1012
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,056
Things

1013
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,455
I tried to take what have you done in your own home that you're like this is a perfect use case

1014
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,735
Of low-hanging fruit

1015
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,503
For the internet

1016
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:05,439
Well actually what my wife doesn't hate is the thing that can and I will admit you think it's a little boring but

1017
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:10,303
It's just simply being able to have light switches that behave like light switches

1018
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,095
Like

1019
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
Smart device

1020
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,399
So that life with a light switch

1021
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,447
Turn on

1022
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,543
So I can kind of get rid of these for arthritis

1023
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,335
Gang of four switches my kitchen

1024
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,151
Turn on each of the individual Banks lights

1025
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
Work 90

1026
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,967
Percent of the time there's a

1027
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
Two things I want to do

1028
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,575
And so by being able replacing light switches

1029
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
Get rid of that turned

1030
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:38,463
And yet I can use the

1031
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,255
So I am now in the process

1032
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
Rewiring the

1033
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,607
And stuff so that nobody even knows

1034
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,887
This is a Smart House

1035
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,167
It's important.

1036
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,703
Having better lighting

1037
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,007
And I love the fact that I can have

1038
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,799
Sling plug into socket

1039
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,639
And having a spotlight be controlled with

1040
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,711
Australian painting with light

1041
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,063
See guys this is why

1042
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,623
I spend so much time talking about lighting on the show

1043
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,183
Because it's it's one of the easiest things to mess with

1044
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,463
It's really smart

1045
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,511
So Scott you're not doing anything with Smart Lipo

1046
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,535
Don't say anything like that yet

1047
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,583
I am

1048
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,887
Smart light bulbs

1049
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,007
Spot because you're fighting the fact

1050
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,591
And so to me I think I should be in sweat

1051
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,871
My current

1052
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
Siri

1053
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
We can argue

1054
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
Will argue about that

1055
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:39,135
Okay. Thank you so much for coming on the show for making me think Deep Thoughts

1056
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,415
Rather early in the morning

1057
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
And

1058
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,231
Conjuring identity and

1059
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,767
Standards and

1060
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:45,791
At the end of

1061
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,559
My Jeepster

1062
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:57,311
That's it for this week's show thanks for listening and we'll see you back here next week
