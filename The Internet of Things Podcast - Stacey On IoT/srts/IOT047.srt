00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,288
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast I am your host

2
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,848
Stacey Higginbotham and this is your co-host

3
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:20,736
If we have got an amazing show for you today because Mobile World Congress is happening

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,760
And because

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,040
I'm really seriously hot

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,576
Internet routers have been launched

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,344
This week

9
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,136
So we're going to have

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,416
Eero routers

11
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,720
We're going to have an update from Philips we're going to have

12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,304
Numbers from Verizon we've got some Tyrone action

13
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,120
New chips for The Internet of Things

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,144
Make a new money

15
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,680
And a whole new network

16
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,704
12

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
Okay so

18
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,056
Let's start with

19
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,080
Eero

20
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,920
Who actually their CEO Nick Weaver's Our Guest

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,248
And I actually also tried out the routers so

22
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,784
Free to talk about those first

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
This is cool now

24
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,368
I did not pre-order these I remember it

25
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:02,464
I want to say was a well over a year ago that Euro announce these

26
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:07,328
Small router / repeaters / metal mesh network devices

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,424
And they're much cheaper than they are today because they're available

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,056
Around now right for 199

29
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
Kickstarter

30
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,408
The crowdfunding will collect

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,968
125

32
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,344
And what's interesting about these I mention Mesh networking

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,672
Everything many people probably by multiple euros

34
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,000
And this present time in a free pack right now

35
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:40,096
499 and I think the kick-start price was 290 nights I wish I had

36
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,680
Me too because I'm going to tell you

37
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,472
I really like these routers

38
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,800
They're amazing but I definitely need three and in the evening

39
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,336
For in my house

40
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,384
Which means I am looking at

41
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,456
502 $700 worth of routers

42
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
Is a lot of routers

43
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:01,856
It is a lot of routers is also a lot of money and which you know some people say why not just

44
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,416
Go in and retrofit hardwire whatever

45
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,232
Your house is pre-wired I know but other people

46
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,512
Might consider that

47
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,096
But you don't you have more flexibility I think with the wireless network

48
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
Something to tell you

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
Tell me a couple things

50
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
I

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
Have

52
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
I really

53
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
Kinda complicated

54
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
House cuz it's really tallest really skinny

55
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
And it's really like

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
Long front to back

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
So

58
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,736
I've never likely to my house instead

59
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Wifi

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
Router is

61
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
Right because you have like

62
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,904
Three stories plus like a rooftop

63
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,976
Yes and because I have always connected gadgets

64
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,072
Connected stuff in my garage I have connected devices on my roof

65
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
My house actually does

66
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
Need coverage for I feel it needs

67
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
Average cousin

68
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,008
There's no point in having a connected garage door opener that doesn't actually open anything

69
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,592
Good Wi-Fi and that's the point of Euro

70
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,992
If you think of nothing else the whole sole purpose of this company right now is to deliver

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
Really

72
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
Great Wi-Fi cover

73
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
Really easily

74
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,136
And that in itself is

75
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
Worth a lot for love

76
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,208
People so when I setup my network

77
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
I had

78
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
3x

79
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,560
Lights and are about a hundred and twenty-five

80
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,376
It's about a hundred fifty when I bought them 3 years ago

81
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
So they're they're actually

82
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,448
Copper bowl

83
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
Price and you can buy

84
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
It in the challenge with an access point is

85
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
They're kind of a mesh Network

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
But they're kind of a pain to set up

87
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
Captain assign IP addresses

88
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,088
Yeah and sometimes they create separate Networks

89
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,720
Experience depending what you buying we got some range extenders have created separate Networks

90
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,304
Yes that's what I was going to say

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
It's probably

92
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Pretzel

93
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
The nice thing that the arrow is

94
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,776
The box is like looking at you and your phone is like your phone's like

95
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:02,176
He's like little pretty diagrams on it like I'm doing something magical and it's making these blinking little

96
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Things

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,040
Magical and then like 30 seconds later it's like

98
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
So set up is easy

99
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
Yes

100
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
I have not set up a notch

101
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,583
Oh okay I have is pretty simple it's it's basically like setting up most any other connected device that's

102
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Seamless to set up

103
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,703
These things are talking to each other so it's best the setup process is

104
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,751
Each one of these little boxes

105
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,799
If you have multiple of something that is

106
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,639
Are setting up a mesh Network and the ones singular

107
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
SSID or net

108
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Yes

109
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
So you got one SSID

110
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
Yay and you can

111
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,903
These can actually be wired so in my case because I've got ethernet Jacks throughout my house

112
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
Minor all wired

113
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
But you can actually

114
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
Have them be Wireless

115
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
An attack

116
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
3pac you only get one ethernet

117
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
So that's to go from your modem

118
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Eero

119
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,127
Right so the one hangs off your modem like a traditional router and then additional ones can either hang off those

120
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
I guess

121
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,943
Daisy chaining them

122
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
What are you doing that for

123
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,503
Wirelessly

124
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
Through Wi-Fi

125
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
Yes got it

126
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
Although they don't

127
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
Feel like there Daisy

128
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
They feel like

129
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
They're not actually

130
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Gearbest

131
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
Okay

132
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
Wow complicated

133
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
So how does it work

134
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,607
It works really well

135
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
So like

136
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,423
The coolest thing was

137
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
In my house

138
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,543
Time Warner Cable who is my internet provider hit actually upgraded

139
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,103
They're upgrading whole country to 300 megabit

140
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,175
Their whole service footprint to 300 megabits per second

141
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
Service

142
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,015
And I was like I haven't gotten to yet

143
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
What they had

144
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
And I just didn't realize it because

145
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
Actually my access

146
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
Which I bought three years ago

147
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
They're probably

148
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
802 11

149
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
And the best

150
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,399
Yeah neither Gyros RAC

151
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
So

152
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
30C Trump's in

153
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
It does

154
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
It does

155
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,127
Ndng a day

156
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
All of the others

157
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,503
Switch is the Halos back for the Internet of Things

158
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
We'll talk about that some other time if it ever happens

159
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
It happen

160
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
I digress

161
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
Faster WiFi

162
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
The app is nice there's not a lot to it

163
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
Best feature

164
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
In the again

165
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
Coverage the next

166
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,655
Text feature that it's offering right now is

167
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
Guess networkx

168
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
SSO

169
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
I now have the ability to do instead of getting my guess

170
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
Act the actual SS

171
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,175
SSID and password

172
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
Social Network I can give them

173
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
The guest password

174
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,159
That the generates for me which is some weed whack password

175
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
And

176
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,999
I can text it to them or I can give it to him

177
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,535
And I can do it all for the app for lease

178
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,143
That is very cool and I should mention Eliza swimming today on Hub

179
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,751
The Google is adding this to the onhub very recently I haven't set it up yet but

180
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,823
Similar thing it you can use the app to set it up and then

181
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
Textured EMF share the

182
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
Information for Fergus

183
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
So don't have to get these little scrap of paper that's

184
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,319
Like the Wi-Fi password is this that you'll lose our look at

185
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
Yeah

186
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,415
So it's super fun

187
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
I like them

188
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
They are expensive

189
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,815
Good Broadband cannot be be

190
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,631
So yeah I mean if you're going to pay for

191
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,215
You're taking your case 300 megabytes per second pay for 150

192
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:42,079
You want to have internal equipment that can actually handle that otherwise you're paying for something you can't really use

193
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
Can you can handle it everywhere

194
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
Everywhere in life

195
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
210 minutes of setup

196
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,807
Like literally it took me more time to run up and down the stairs

197
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
These things that place

198
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Set them up

199
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,439
I am very tempted

200
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Backpage

201
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,767
Make the investment because I love my onhub

202
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,863
But sometimes in certain areas the house it's just not cutting it

203
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,447
And I thought about other Alternatives so this might be one

204
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,823
I will say this I read a couple of other reviews on this because they all went live today that they were recording

205
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
And couple

206
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
What is a couple people commented about how

207
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,735
Eero requires in the app that have your

208
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
I think your email address but your

209
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
Phone number as well

210
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,599
Okay so I can explain this

211
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,951
And I was wondering if this comes up in your interview and if it does then we can just hold out till later

212
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
I don't remember

213
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
Alright well

214
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
Prescott weather

215
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
CC

216
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
If you're hearing this twice

217
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
It's because

218
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,263
Friend is actually security feature so it ties and all the stuff security stuff

219
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
Sony Cleaver the CEO

220
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:52,735
Said that so many customers were setting terrible passwords like password 1-2-3 was a favorite of everyone's

221
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
Videos like

222
00:08:55,295 --> 00:09:00,415
And given all the scrutiny to router security lately he was like this is terrible so he said he's

223
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,231
He's not doing password so the reason why he has

224
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
Or the company has you give your email or your phone number is so it will email you or give you

225
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,935
You or text you a verification code

226
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
And so it's kind of a password

227
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
You

228
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,799
You answer that in and then you get the verification

229
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,663
Sentence for the setup of the actual router

230
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,015
Next to log into the system every time you need to log into

231
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
System

232
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
OKC

233
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Every single

234
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,487
So what an end that makes sense so now I don't know if

235
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:41,375
Other people understood that from the other reviews I'm glad that you asked him that we found that out

236
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
I'm wondering then

237
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
Can you still

238
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:49,311
Normally set up a password for devices to connect your network or you still at your current

239
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
Wireless network

240
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Will have it

241
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
Same password

242
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
So

243
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,247
My network like Stacy's home network

244
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,319
If my home network password was password one

245
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,159
23 it would still be I can still set my

246
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
My SSID for Stacy's home network

247
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,767
Ssids pass

248
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
He tried everything

249
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,679
So this was just to get into the app

250
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
Got it

251
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
Got it since I first line of defense

252
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
Which is you know

253
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,943
Cuz if you baby change the password on my

254
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
Like actual wireless network

255
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
I would come I would

256
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,087
Dumpty's routers in the ocean and then I would like

257
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,367
Set them on fire

258
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,999
I I know that's kind of like impossible to do but that's what I would do because I have so many devices

259
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,815
Changing the password

260
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
I get it

261
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,703
So yeah if you know my wireless password it's highly unlikely

262
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Kevin's like

263
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,639
Haven't tried in awhile me see if I can

264
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Turn lights on

265
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,807
All right speaking of Lights let's go

266
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,647
Good Segway but I'm not looking forward to sharing this news

267
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,951
We talked last week about Phillips

268
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,535
And they're Hue app and they updated it on the Android

269
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,095
Punched everyone Chagrin and they

270
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
February 12th after today

271
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,007
Permissions for Android 6.0 incorrectly

272
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
It sounds

273
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,223
Like and we mention this last week that it sounded like they implemented this incorrectly and it does not appear fix

274
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
Text as of yet as well

275
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,367
And if you missed our show last week basically if you've got the Philips Hue app right now

276
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,695
You'll start to see the app ask for

277
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
Individual permission

278
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,815
Android 6.0 marshmallow features

279
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
IPod Philips Hue 4

280
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,911
Doing what they should be doing to prepare their app for

281
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
Compatibility on marshmallow

282
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,287
The problem is two problems really one

283
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,943
Philips Hue haven't really made it clear why they need these permissions although I understand why and once you understand why you're probably

284
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
Oh okay I get it now

285
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Regardless of that

286
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:12,671
The way the app permissions are implemented today in the current version of the app If you deny permission for one of the three things

287
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,743
History things are camera storage and location

288
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
The Apple workout

289
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
So

290
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:23,423
That's not how it's supposed to work basically if you don't want the app to have access to your camera

291
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,983
Which is actually needed to create light scenes

292
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,031
It should still work that function

293
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
Wouldn't work though the app itself should work

294
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:35,711
So really they got if they got to fix this we just before the show checked in the Play Store

295
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:41,855
And that's at the last couple days they're still getting hammered people cannot use the Philips Hue app why can't user lights

296
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,183
It's very frustrating and I hope it gets resolved soon

297
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
So yeah Phillips

298
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,047
We reached out to Phyllis before last week's show they didn't get back to me though until

299
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
A couple days ago so yeah

300
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
They just wanted to let us know

301
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:58,751
That and let everybody listen to the show and who might be affected in feeling kind of like or Phillips

302
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,407
Only makes use of these permissions when the functionality related to them is being used

303
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,223
I don't access to usage data for these permissions

304
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,015
Any other purpose than

305
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,599
What we talked about to creating light scenes

306
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,671
Storage is using is also used to create light

307
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
After photos

308
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
And location is

309
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Is Portugal fencing

310
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
So that's it

311
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,839
But they are also currently working on a fix for this

312
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
So it's implemented correctly

313
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,215
So they're going to come back to us when they've done that fix

314
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,543
We really hope it's soon because they are taking a beating in the App Store

315
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
And hopefully that happens

316
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
That is that

317
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
Phillips is on it you guys

318
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
Bingo that you're upset

319
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,295
But they're not using your data in any weird nefarious way so please

320
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:49,183
Feel free to continue using Phillips and Grant them those permissions or feel free not to do it

321
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
And maybe don't

322
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,255
Top 10 light some candles

323
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
Enjoy okay

324
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,703
So let's see we've got news Verizon

325
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
Verizon is doing

326
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,799
Really well it's catching up to its it's

327
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,615
Ginormous rival AT&T in the iot space

328
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Bear

329
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:13,759
Revenue from their iot and telematics business has total 690 million

330
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
As of year-end in 2050

331
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,855
Teen Witch is up 18%

332
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
Which is

333
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
Not too shabby

334
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
Yeah I think that 18% is

335
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:27,839
Yearly growth and I dug around us and another figure to put this in perspective

336
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,399
Back on October 28th when they

337
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
Announce their

338
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
Thingspace platform

339
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,311
They had said then that their IRT and telematics revenues were at

340
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
495 million year-to-date

341
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,711
So from October 28th will basically two months the last two months

342
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,831
They've jumped the revenue for 495 million to what we just say 600 end

343
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
90 million + 90 million

344
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
And that's that

345
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Pretty good

346
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,279
But as you mentioned they're just still catching up so they're big rival AT&T

347
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:02,143
Think you mentioned before the show they were there IRT business was a billion-dollar business

348
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
As of last year

349
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
It was on Pace

350
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Billion dollar bill

351
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
15

352
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:12,895
And a lot of AT&T business comes from the connected car cuz they've got to pick up for the fat Tesla they've got out

353
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
They got a lot

354
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Golang

355
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,783
Not axle nut Studebaker

356
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,183
Verizon thingspace is there developer platform

357
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
Just in case you guys are

358
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Like what what

359
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
It is a cloud platform

360
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
For Developers

361
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,679
You know Verizon has been very upfront about how it's looking at this it is

362
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,495
Definitely saying we have got to sell more than connectivity

363
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:45,151
That is that is not going to be a big Revenue grab which I am thankful for because then the data plans would be you know just

364
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
Crazy insane

365
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
Expensive

366
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,039
And they're trying to sell strategy around this so there

367
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
Holding

368
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,855
Cloud together with Consulting

369
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,951
And trying to create these Partnerships with companies that are already in the space

370
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
To build kind of

371
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,559
It's basically a Consulting and systems integrator kinda

372
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,959
They worked quite a bit with Nokian Erickson on the on the network itself and what they're saying

373
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:15,871
I'll see you today actually from Emma World Congress they said they now have 4,000 more than 4,000 Developers

374
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
On thingspace which is

375
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,503
I'm impressed by the number it may concern they just launched it back at the very end of October

376
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,599
Yeah that's that's pretty good I don't know

377
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
I mean it

378
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
How do we count

379
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
Yeah that's it a tough

380
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:38,143
It's hard to quantify minutes it's just a single data point I mean I'm curious to see who actually does

381
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,703
Some of these developers and partners are what products

382
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,751
Delivered or plan to deliver

383
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
So also

384
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
NWC

385
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:51,455
Trendsetter Cloud apis on things face will be available soon in beta

386
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,015
Statway dad's can create mobile apps

387
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,575
Retrieve photos video music and other clouds

388
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
Content so

389
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
It's all very interesting kind of reminds me of

390
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
What Amazon is doing with

391
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,255
My birthday for devices but that's just me

392
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,095
It would be here

393
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:12,703
I'm also at Mobile World Congress because how can we not talk about the show with it going on

394
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
This week

395
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
AT&T announced a plan to

396
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
Well is it a plant

397
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,407
Degree to test

398
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,711
Agreed to test for G

399
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,039
Drones in conjunction with until

400
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:31,135
So what we've got basically is drones that are capable of

401
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,207
Assuring really shrink data really fast

402
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:40,863
Not only that I mean I look at this as somebody who owns a drone and yes I did register I do have my FAA number

403
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
What's interesting is

404
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,007
I can pretty much only use my drone in line of sight because it's using Wi-Fi

405
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:52,895
So I've got a pretty limited range when you really think about it compared to 4G all the sudden you open up to a

406
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,687
I offered you networking

407
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,735
Songs on following the rules

408
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
Fly my drone

409
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
10 miles away

410
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,647
Oh my gosh your drone could become a package delivered

411
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
Yeah

412
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
Exactly you know what Amazon it

413
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,559
Do those round thing for deliveries but why not like pickup

414
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,143
Let me just have my drone drop down loaded up and

415
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,959
You could become like an eardrum could become like the equivalent of a

416
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Uber driver

417
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
Logistics

418
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
Boggles my mind

419
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Cool

420
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
But yes

421
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:28,991
Yes this could be awesome it also kind of creates new ways to police the space if you think about

422
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,039
What kind of things you can do with like

423
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
Cellular data and

424
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
The controls you have there

425
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,183
Not only did they talk to each other to avoid collisions

426
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,255
The Operators could then have a lot more

427
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
Control over

428
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,071
How these things are running

429
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
Because I can

430
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,423
Control how they're talking to each other

431
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,287
Yeah it does it to me because I wasn't thinking about it no with multiple drones you know

432
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,359
Turn on Wi-Fi networks here you know

433
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,407
Where were separate where were

434
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,247
Not able to share data between drones or talk to each other or someone like that

435
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,551
I bet you put us all on the same network

436
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
Responsibilities

437
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
So exciting news there

438
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
We'll keep an eye on that

439
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,535
Also at Mobile World Congress Nokia announced

440
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Money

441
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:20,191
They have create Nokia growth Partners has created a 350 million dollar internet-of-things fund

442
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
And this is actually for

443
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,031
It looks like it's more for

444
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,103
Technologies to enable the internet of things which

445
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Yay

446
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
So

447
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,223
Not just like hey I've got a connected fork for you but

448
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
Things like

449
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:39,647
I've got some I got a cool technology for real-time data access or maybe I've got like a new way to control drones over LTE

450
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,231
These are the kind of ideas you can give to them and

451
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,279
This is a global fund so

452
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,815
It's not just you eccentric

453
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:47,839
Yaever

454
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,887
I have not limited to espoo Finland

455
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,935
Also not limited espoo Finland

456
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,007
I like to say

457
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
The arm

458
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,431
You want to talk about the army yes yes yes

459
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,015
What is happening arm has a new chip that is

460
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,343
Probably going to find its way into maybe like a Raspberry Pi device

461
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
But also

462
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:15,231
Looks really good for wearables it's the cortex a 30

463
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
2

464
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,303
The big deal here is

465
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:23,935
Arm did something smart we talked about this before the show and I think we're both in agreement that you can disagree if you'd like

466
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:29,055
They decided to make the CPU just 32-bit compatible not 64-bit

467
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:36,223
What kind of work were bandanas around thinking that kind of makes sense because you know with a with a wearable device a real small device

468
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,575
Are you going to need to address more than 4GB of memory probably not

469
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,159
So that introduces some overhead gives them a little bit more

470
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,463
Power efficiency this thing

471
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:52,863
Jeezy say it's less than 4 milliwatts of power at 100 megahertz clock speed

472
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
You can have a

473
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,239
Quad-core version that's where it's less than 75 milliwatts

474
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,055
Procore at 1 gigahertz scale it up

475
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:05,151
How do you say to recently fast speeds for something like a where Laura or a pie

476
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,967
But they're also saying no internet of things things my

477
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,759
Like this nicely so

478
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
It's interesting

479
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,343
There's a couple things interesting here and

480
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
You named almost

481
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,696
And I just want to break it down for people who are like

482
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
What the heck

483
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
Just happened Kevin was like

484
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,072
Talking like a normal human being and then he just like

485
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Yeah

486
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
So

487
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Artmix

488
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Ship designs roots and I'm going to give it a shot

489
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,032
I may not do any better than Kevin

490
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,848
Arm is not actually it doesn't make physical chips

491
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
It makes it designs

492
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,920
Seven other companies like apple or

493
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,992
Samsung Cloud

494
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,528
Take the designs that are make

495
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,576
And actually makes physical chips

496
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,904
Specially designed ships and other people make the chips for the butt

497
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
So fun being complicated

498
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
What happened in Computing is

499
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,328
There's like this whole like end of Moore's law say

500
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
Great and I'm going to I'm going to go there be

501
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,216
Because I think this is really a big Transit is really exciting and we're talking

502
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,008
Even if this weren't iot show

503
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,824
Moore's law states the number of transistors on a chip

504
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
Doubles every two years

505
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
And because of that

506
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
Are chips are gotten

507
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,224
Just much faster

508
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,504
Art store just got

509
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,576
You've got more storage for less money it's amazing right

510
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,136
But what's happened is we just can't do that anymore

511
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
At this point we

512
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
No we were going to get the

513
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:27,840
There for years but we're at this point where we've been experimenting with all these crazy new architectures

514
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,912
Because we don't actually cedar chips to get faster anymore because

515
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,728
It's way cooler if they're more power-efficient

516
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,336
If they're smaller because we're using our chips not just in these massive servers and

517
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,640
Computers but were using them in like

518
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,712
Wrist watches in washing machines and all these other crazy place

519
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,272
So with this computer

520
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
Arm is actually saying

521
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,672
Total race to get faster and faster and party that's like

522
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,232
The fact that they've gone these 64-bit chips

523
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,560
Because you know our smartphones and needed to get faster and

524
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,376
You know they want to get in the server so those have to be pastor

525
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
Who said hey wait

526
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Wait

527
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,216
We don't always have to go that way

528
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,056
We could actually take a step back and do a 32-bit computer

529
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
Did still

530
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,640
Got this more modern instruction set

531
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,456
And has his more modern architecture

532
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,736
Do it because

533
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,528
All kinds of crazy

534
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
So I think that's kind of like

535
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,648
Big picture of really cool things

536
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,928
What's happening

537
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
And I don't know if that helps

538
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
And what time

539
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
Spell memories

540
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,328
Make any sense

541
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,608
But yeah

542
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Is awesome

543
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
So

544
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,704
That's that's that

545
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,264
Blissey final thing should we talk about

546
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,056
New wireless networks

547
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
What about now

548
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,664
So company called ingenue

549
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,968
Launch a wireless network

550
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
4

551
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
The Internet of Things

552
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
It's kind of like sigfox

553
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Or

554
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,880
Laura is a standard a section out of

555
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
Separate network but it

556
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
It's a separate radio standard for

557
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
Networks

558
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,536
Carrie like small amounts of data

559
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,840
And are usually pretty cheap to run

560
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
And there

561
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,168
I never really interesting kind of option

562
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Connected devices

563
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:14,336
So ingenue is saying they said it Mobile World Congress that they were going to lunch this network

564
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
In

565
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,896
Pitea bunch of different places yes

566
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,968
Yeah I think they said they have 30

567
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
8

568
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,040
Private networks now in

569
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,344
25 countries that will be providing

570
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,904
Connectivity in 25 countries for machine traffic

571
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,232
Yes and these countries included the US

572
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,304
But they also include Canada Nigeria

573
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Chili

574
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,864
Japan and New Zealand

575
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
South

576
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
Thailand

577
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,192
United Arab Emirates

578
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,264
I'm at home. I was going to say I'm about to sing It's a Small World

579
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
Yeah

580
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,592
Don't do that no no no

581
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,640
So the cool think so

582
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:55,040
What they use is a use a radio technology they don't use Laura they don't use sick foxes technology they use something called

583
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
Have to find it because

584
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
It's crazy acronym

585
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,440
RPM a random phase multiple access

586
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488
Great you want to tell us what that is

587
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,120
I'm not sure what it is it sounds like a teleporter to me

588
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,936
Okay basically it's a low power

589
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,752
Network that they built and it only

590
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:21,408
Has the only carries that are small bits of data it's not very fast it's not like I'm far 4 G networks is

591
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,968
Purpose Driven Network

592
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,368
I think I'd seen that the top speed of the network is like 624 kilobits per second

593
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,184
When is basically machine-to-machine specific Network

594
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,768
Yes it is 624 kilobits per second

595
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,352
That's download speeds than upload speeds r156

596
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,376
Kilobits per second

597
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
So

598
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,216
But slower than 2G

599
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,008
Yeah I was going to say it's like you're

600
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
But interesting thing to me is

601
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,640
The range of this network

602
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,432
Because they're carrying

603
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
Small bits of data

604
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:01,088
Slower speeds and they've got their RPM a protocol which again I don't have the details of

605
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
They can have

606
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,672
Cellular towers for this network that are

607
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,744
1 towering cover 300 square miles which is

608
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,840
Not many Towers compared to our heavy data-centric networks of today

609
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,656
It's true but it does still require Towers

610
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
Which means

611
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,496
And all of these networks actually do require

612
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,056
If a significant investment which makes them kind of

613
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:25,408
You know whatever I am looking at these types of networks or any type of wireless network

614
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,944
Because everybody has a dream

615
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,736
I'm starting to wireless network

616
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,576
A lot of people I need half the screen

617
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:38,208
You always have to look at things like the economics of it which are how far apart of your Towers cuz that's a big city

618
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
Investment

619
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
Read how

620
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
How are you going to get

621
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,632
Any sort of specialized radio protocol like RPM

622
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,728
Requires some sort of specialized

623
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,544
Chip to read that radio protocol in the device

624
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Espresso

625
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,384
You're going to have a special purpose to buy so how are they going to get that

626
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
Chores who are their partner

627
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:06,112
Interesting in this case is the people behind this company ingenue and it used to be known as Reiko Wireless

628
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,208
Under that name of the work with T-Mobile and was part of its in Denver

629
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,608
On the board of ingenue is Ivan Seidenberg who was the former CEO

630
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
Verizon

631
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,496
And dr. Andrew viterbi who is the former CTO Qualcomm

632
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
So

633
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,104
Those are actually two very smart guys when it comes to radio

634
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Technology

635
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,456
And cellular at the economics of building a cellular wireless network

636
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,224
Sound like

637
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
Could be cool

638
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,832
Lot of challenges yet I think but

639
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856
Yakiniku

640
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:43,488
Yeah I'm still I'm always skeptical about these just because I'm like you know what's you have data

641
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,536
You never say this is enough data

642
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,328
He always want more more

643
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,936
But you don't baby so into do without their its competitors or things like Laura

644
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,704
Like

645
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
Sigfox

646
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,312
And you know that the cellular carriers are also testing

647
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
You know like lte-m

648
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,640
So the LTE machine Networks

649
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,224
We'll just have to see so keep an eye on the space because it's

650
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,248
In a lot of

651
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,832
Storm and fury here but I just don't know if there's much

652
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,672
I'm curious as to what spectrum there going to be using and someone as well

653
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,512
Well that's that's a big issue

654
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
That is it

655
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
Alright well

656
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
You guys have been so patient

657
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,472
Now we can

658
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,032
Stay tuned for a chat with Nick Weaver

659
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,848
Who is the CEO of hero who's going to talk about

660
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,504
Well he may talk about some of the things we've already talked about but he's also a lot more stay

661
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,904
Listening

662
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:48,512
Hey everyone it's Stacey Higginbotham and you are listening to The Internet of Things podcast

663
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,816
And today my guest is Nick

664
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,912
Weaver and he is the co-founder and CEO of Eero

665
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,448
Hey Nick how are you doing

666
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
Great City how are you doing

667
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,568
So let's get started with

668
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,360
What is Eero

669
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,176
Yeah so euro is a

670
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,992
A really simple whole home wi-fi system

671
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,552
Key difference between

672
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
What folks normally have

673
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,648
To power their home Wi-Fi is

674
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
It's typically

675
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
One router

676
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,768
And so what we

677
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,072
Offer instead is this whole home system

678
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
Where you at multiple units

679
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,400
All connect to each other

680
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,424
City of one

681
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,520
Single Wi-Fi network name that blankets every corner of your home with

682
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,312
With really fast reliable

683
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
So

684
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
Just for people listening

685
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
I have had

686
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,456
Whole-home reliable

687
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
Wi-Fi

688
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,016
But I had mine because I had

689
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,088
I have three access points to my house plus my router

690
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
And

691
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,488
Then Nick came over and he and his team installed Eros

692
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
Which

693
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
Installed apps

694
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,840
Because they are really easy

695
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,144
Kevin and I have already talked about it

696
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,680
Most people though you're right

697
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,704
They buy a router

698
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,752
They're like oh this is great except

699
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,520
It doesn't your

700
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
Exactly

701
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,432
It is one problem and I like to think of it as

702
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,736
You're part of this whole new generation

703
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
Companies that are alike

704
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,064
My God my Wi-Fi router

705
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
Is

706
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,928
Probably one of the most important pieces of equipment in my home

707
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,256
Terrible it hasn't changed in like a decade

708
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,792
We're more

709
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
And

710
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,472
It's got those janky software it's probably a security risk is this article for the Wall Street Journal has discovered

711
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
And you guys set out

712
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
2 years ago

713
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:42,432
Yeah we got started in the beginning of 2014 so you guys set out two years ago to change all that

714
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,968
And so

715
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,272
Let's talk about what you did because

716
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,088
Design is probably the first thing people notice

717
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,368
This is a

718
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
Pretty little white box

719
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,464
So when I get to spend a lot of time talking about that

720
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232
But then

721
00:30:55,488 --> 00:31:00,096
The other thing they're going to notice is the fact that each one of these little white boxes cost $199

722
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,632
Kind of a lot for a router

723
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
So what are you

724
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
You getting

725
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,264
Yes so with with Ichiro you're getting

726
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,824
Some of the highest performance

727
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,128
Home WiFi coverage available

728
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
So

729
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,712
A single unit retails for 199

730
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,552
And if you buy system which starts with three units

731
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,344
Prices for 99

732
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:26,720
What you're getting with Eero is you know if you go look at the

733
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,256
Home networking category

734
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,560
You'll see there's Home wireless routers

735
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
Sherpas home

736
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,376
Wireless access points

737
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
And there's also things called

738
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
Range extenders

739
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,496
For wireless extender

740
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,544
What what year was it

741
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,104
It's all three of those things all in one box

742
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,664
And our software we felt

743
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,968
Well automatically detect

744
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,504
How your system setup

745
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,808
And optimize your network

746
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,112
Docker no configuration no settings

747
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,672
All you have to do is just say I want to

748
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,440
Network

749
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:01,280
With this network name and with this password and then you're up and running

750
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
So you got

751
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,840
These guys switch

752
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,656
Really was as simple as I took it

753
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
Brand of software

754
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,056
On the app I downloaded the app and

755
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,408
Do you want to add an arrow and I was like yes I do

756
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
It was like

757
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,736
It's on the Eero

758
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
There was like

759
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,088
I found the Eero connected the arrow in the air was like

760
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:29,184
The lights the lights the lights

761
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
It was

762
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
So

763
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
In my network

764
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,376
It was stopping it from being awesome was actually my old school switches

765
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,400
Which

766
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,704
Nick has kindly sent me an email news like

767
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,776
Hey Stacy your switches are for a hundred my networking

768
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:48,128
Which I thought was cool but I couldn't see that on my own

769
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
What we do

770
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
Every Network

771
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,016
Is constantly running Diagnostics

772
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,040
And

773
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:59,648
Alpha Diagnostics improve more and more that information will find its way

774
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,440
In2 into the app

775
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,512
So let's talk about the app

776
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
Because

777
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
Really that's kind of I think that's probably

778
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,912
Totally agree

779
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,472
Oh wait before this that we have to tell everybody

780
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,496
Why

781
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,288
Why with the internet

782
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
Things podcast

783
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,384
Do we care about

784
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
Better wife

785
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:29,600
Yeah it's so it's so what's what's been fascinating over the last couple years is just the number of devices that are connected

786
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,440
So not news to you or anyone else who's listening

787
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,608
You know we now have connected thermostat speakers camera sensors blinds lights

788
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,680
Events the list goes on and on and on

789
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,496
And as all these devices come online

790
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,544
They need to connect an

791
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,336
Every corner of your home

792
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,896
So when you don't have great connectivity

793
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
It's really

794
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,480
Card for these connected devices to come to life

795
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
So

796
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:02,112
There's there's a combination of the number of devices and types of devices that are connecting

797
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
And

798
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,488
Cutting the cord has actually taken hold

799
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
Where

800
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:12,096
People are now streaming video everywhere their home they aren't relying on

801
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,656
Just their cable or satellite provider

802
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,472
So you have these two forces murdering one is

803
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,752
Lots of devices

804
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,800
Disconnected everywhere and the other is

805
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,616
You need really high speed reliable

806
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
Connectivity

807
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,456
To stream video in every room in your home

808
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,224
Got it

809
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,552
Totally attached to the first which is

810
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
I have

811
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:36,672
Sonos speakers on my roof and then all the way down in my garage I have

812
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208
Actually I have a Tesla.

813
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,768
Needs over-the-air updates via Wireless

814
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,840
And I also have a MyQ garage door opener that it's like

815
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,144
I'm connected to WiFi as well

816
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
So

817
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
Yeah

818
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,752
So Wi-Fi totally important to me

819
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,080
Let's sew on the connectivity front my TVs are Hardware

820
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,128
Which I totally recommend to anyone who can do it

821
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,176
But if you can't I did run some

822
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,968
I was watching something on a tablet

823
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,760
Over this since I was like hey

824
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,296
It's not stuttering

825
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
Nice

826
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,880
What is Sutter's I'm sure that's not necessarily my

827
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,184
My face at work it could just be my highest p

828
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,000
Which actually brings me to a question because I thought

829
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,024
Given

830
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,840
The Diagnostics you guys have in

831
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,864
If you have

832
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:21,728
A huge customer base you're going to start seeing a lot of really interesting data about

833
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,824
Kind of broadband speeds and connectivity just around

834
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,872
Hopefully the country depending on how

835
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,920
How large customer base you get

836
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,480
Is that something you're kind of thinking about using

837
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,040
Or if you're totally correct that's

838
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,112
That's information that we do have and we monitor really closely

839
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,672
The reason we monitor that closely is

840
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,744
Can directly impact somebody's experience with their Network

841
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:48,352
So what we found in our peda. Where we have

842
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,424
Under the customers and thousand of Eros online

843
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,240
As you can see the Ebbs and flows

844
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,288
Your connectivity across the country

845
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:02,176
Well you can see everything from weather creating outages

846
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
2

847
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,992
Certain parts of the country have faster

848
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:08,064
A burger medium Connections in other parts of the country

849
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,136
And it's so as more and more your networks come online

850
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,720
That becomes a really interesting dataset to understand

851
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,280
Exactly how well does the internet work

852
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:21,120
From a speed and reliability perspective everywhere in the US

853
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,936
So where would you like to live based on the data you seen

854
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,496
Where does someone who really loves Broadband Bridge today

855
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,032
Where should I move

856
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,104
Yeah it's so it it's interesting there's

857
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,992
Median speeds are definitely faster in call the top 30 metropolitan areas

858
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,552
But then you also have these outliers we're

859
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
You have

860
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:44,160
Regional providers that that might have their own fiber

861
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,720
Where you get really really fast connections

862
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:50,304
And in some smaller geographies across the country

863
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:56,192
Exciting all right let's take it back to the house and let's take it back to kind of

864
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:01,568
What you guys are planning to do with this because one of the features you'll have is kind of a guest Network

865
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,640
You make it very easy for me to create a guest Network for p

866
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
People

867
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
Which is

868
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Super nice

869
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,272
But in a previous conversation that we had

870
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
We kind of talked about

871
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,368
How to think about identity

872
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,160
Four things on the network

873
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,720
And I'd be kind of curious about

874
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
Going forward

875
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,536
What is kind of

876
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,888
Your goal for all of the smarts that you're building into this

877
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,424
Router because

878
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,448
You could do a lot with

879
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
This platform

880
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,752
The biggest wanted is

881
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,544
These devices are

882
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,616
For lack of a better phrase Arthur typically just black boxes

883
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
Authors

884
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,688
There's a lot of information

885
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
There's

886
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:44,320
A lot of different devices connecting and a lot of the work that we have

887
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,880
Accomplished and also ahead of us is

888
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:50,720
How do we take all that information and make it really easy for people to understand

889
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,048
Done as always devices. Connecting throughout our homes

890
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,888
Looking at your home network is it is a great indicator of

891
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,168
What's happening in your home

892
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,448
What's going on

893
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,984
What devices are connecting

894
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,288
And then what things are happening

895
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:09,152
And a lot of the work that we're doing is helping people understand all those nuances

896
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,688
Edit it starts with

897
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:15,040
First let's get you really reliable connectivity so all your device devices are connected

898
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
The one network

899
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,344
And then from there let's

900
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
Hope you understand exactly what's happening

901
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
From

902
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,488
Number of devices connected to the types of devices connected

903
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
Why

904
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
This box

905
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,864
Now why did it take a startup to do this

906
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
When we have had

907
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,776
We have these major companies Cisco you stolen linksys now Belkin has it I mean

908
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
Netgear

909
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,128
Dealing all of these are major companies that have

910
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,968
Lots of big budgets why aren't they

911
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
Why does it take

912
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
A startup like

913
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,040
Make yourself to do

914
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,136
When you have a an existing

915
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,952
Is density of an existing product portfolio

916
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,256
It's really hard to start from Square One

917
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,560
And rethink the entire product experience

918
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,120
So when you when you think of

919
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:05,216
Typical home networking products today they're all

920
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
White products

921
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,056
Meaning. They're all designed to act

922
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,848
On the round independently

923
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,152
So like we talked about earlier

924
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:17,504
Most homes run on one router and it's so that's what these devices are

925
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,272
Design for

926
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,344
Single device in your home providing connectivity failure

927
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
Devices

928
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
Now

929
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,696
Hazard connectivity needs have

930
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:32,096
Changed as more devices have come online as streaming has become more and more important and as the canoe

931
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,632
Directions speeds into our home

932
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,168
Have improved dramatically

933
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,472
Allow you to have multiple devices

934
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,264
Allprovide Wi-Fi

935
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
Track your home

936
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,640
Now that the Big Challenge when you go from one device to multiple is

937
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,456
All this configuration all of these settings

938
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
And

939
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:53,600
What we've done to simplify all that is basically started with a new

940
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,160
Architecture new way of building this product

941
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:01,280
So what we have is we have the same software layer across every single year device

942
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
And

943
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
They're all tied to the cloud

944
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,656
So what the cloud allows us to do is

945
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,192
You can think of it as your

946
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,264
Friendly network engineer in the sky

947
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:16,128
That's what's responsible for tuning in configuring and setting up your network

948
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,200
So as a customer all you have to do is

949
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,504
Think about your network name and password

950
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,320
Then all the settings the background are all configured

951
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,856
Empire clock controller

952
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,416
So with everything in the cloud

953
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,488
That's a lot of information about

954
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:36,864
You got all the devices in my house you got a lot of information that you can infer from that about my comings and goings

955
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
How secure is that

956
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,752
Yes so if you're we take security very very seriously

957
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,032
In terms of

958
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:48,384
What information is available at the cloud only captures the information that's

959
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,968
Bishounen the app in terms of number devices and speed

960
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,040
We also have diagnostic information to help us tune

961
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,600
That works and that's all around connections

962
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,392
Speeds and links between Heroes

963
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,208
At no point do we ever know

964
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
Where you're going on Pine

965
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:10,400
That's not information that we care about it says it's both now capability of the system North it's

966
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,192
Something that that's implemented today

967
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,728
Okay so you know that I have

968
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,288
27

969
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:23,968
Nest thermostat and 6

970
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,992
In my house

971
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
Example

972
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,808
But that's the extent of your knowledge

973
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:31,392
Or is the extent of your knowledge just that I have 27 devices

974
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,208
We have the the names of all the devices so

975
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,000
Every time it gets displayed in the app

976
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,560
That's that information is coming directly from iCloud

977
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,096
And the reason

978
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,376
That's important is

979
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:46,496
You can be off your network so across town across the country across the world

980
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,312
I mean you could still be able to check in and see

981
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,592
What's happening on your network

982
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,151
On the security front aside from not

983
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,175
Capturing

984
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,711
Information about where I visit

985
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,783
There's also the issue of keeping your both firmware

986
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,319
And everything else updated

987
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,855
How are you guys

988
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
Looking at that

989
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:09,279
Because I know that a lot of the existing routers you're talking about 10 year old firmware you're talking about Hardware that isn't updated

990
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,303
All kinds of

991
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,095
So it's really interesting

992
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,375
And it doesn't

993
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,447
Really come as a surprise is the vast majority of

994
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:22,335
At home networks have never had the software on the network updated and that's becoming an increasingly

995
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,359
Larger problem

996
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,407
All these devices are

997
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,711
Your home network really become the

998
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,039
Security layer for all the experiences in your home

999
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,831
And if you're not updating your software you

1000
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,367
You're really leaving yourself vulnerable

1001
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,183
So and that's one of the biggest benefits of

1002
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:41,535
How they are devices tied to the cloud where we update your network automatically

1003
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:42,559
So

1004
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,095
That you always have the

1005
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,375
Latest firmware

1006
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,423
With the latest security patches

1007
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,447
And you also get

1008
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
With only products you

1009
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,823
Typically have to go to some support site

1010
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,223
Download a firmware image find the right page in the admin utility to upload it and then once you upload it

1011
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,039
Wipes all your settings and you have to reconfigure everything

1012
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
There are other

1013
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Routers out

1014
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
Kind of launching

1015
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,439
Couch

1016
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,743
Using a router I think that's a boxes

1017
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,767
It's in front of your router

1018
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,815
But then there's routers like luma

1019
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,375
They're actually security specific

1020
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,215
Routers that offer some of them run software that's

1021
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,007
Continually updated to fight against

1022
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,031
Malware

1023
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,311
Some of them have

1024
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,383
Looking for

1025
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,919
Bad Network Behavior

1026
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,991
Is that something you guys are kind of looking at or doing

1027
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,039
Yeah I think the first order is

1028
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:38,879
You have to just make sure the software running a network is really secure and up

1029
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,415
That gives you a

1030
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
Huge Head Start

1031
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,487
Compared to the other products

1032
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,511
So

1033
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,839
The first thing you have to do is make sure those systems are in place and everything's up to date

1034
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,399
Play the terms of adding more preemptive

1035
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,239
I features the monitor anomalies on your network

1036
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,543
Yeah that's that's definitely something that's very interesting

1037
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,079
You got to learn to walk

1038
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Absolutely

1039
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:00,895
Got it

1040
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,455
Now let's talk about features because

1041
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:09,855
I feel like this has the potential to be kind of like the Amazon Echo in the sense that it could get new stuff over time which is cool

1042
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,439
Because right now it feels pretty

1043
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:17,535
Barebones III love the speed test I love knowing what devices are in my

1044
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,583
But I do want to have

1045
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,887
Kind of more granular control over them

1046
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:26,495
Partly because I tested other routers that already allow me this so I'd love to be able to say

1047
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,359
I want to add like whitelisted sites to my daughters camp

1048
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,895
As opposed to

1049
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:37,247
I want to say hey turn my daughter's computer off at 8:30 when it's her bedtime

1050
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,783
Interest rate up gun

1051
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,879
So are those features that we can look forward to Overtime or

1052
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,903
Is that just not

1053
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
The plans

1054
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,231
The number one thing we're focused on

1055
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,511
Is providing you with

1056
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,047
Really reliable

1057
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,119
And estas connectivity everywhere in your home

1058
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,935
That's a core feature that's been overlooked

1059
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:01,311
Buy a lot of products and Ernie's evolved in our homes because all these connected devices and

1060
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
All of us

1061
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,639
Streaming the people do on a daily basis

1062
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,175
You know that need

1063
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
Continues to grow

1064
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,735
In terms of other features

1065
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,783
A lot of those things are pretty interesting

1066
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,343
And a lot of customers have have

1067
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,647
Reviews on from you

1068
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,719
Again that's the that's the beauty of this system

1069
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,023
Is it keeps getting better and better over time

1070
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,607
Juicy new products for example coming out

1071
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,655
Like right now you're doing this

1072
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:30,239
And I know you're only 2 years old but you know everybody's got a roadmap so

1073
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,775
What would come next sludge

1074
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:32,799
For you guys

1075
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
Again

1076
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,151
Today we are really focused on on fixing the connective

1077
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,431
Three problems in the home so

1078
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,479
Anything we can do to improve that

1079
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,551
I'm so that all these experiences in our homework

1080
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,575
That's what euros

1081
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,343
Pakistan

1082
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,111
By that much

1083
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,903
You might want to start an ISP

1084
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
ESP front

1085
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:54,559
That's pretty expensive starting a starting hardware company is

1086
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:57,631
Is expensive as well but laying fiber and

1087
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,167
Karate connectivity everywhere

1088
00:45:59,423 --> 00:45:59,935
That's

1089
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,983
That's a pretty big

1090
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
That's not something you can

1091
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,823
If you can I wish you the best of luck

1092
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,615
There we go alright

1093
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,663
Thank you so much for coming down the pike

1094
