Alrighty Kevin

33
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
Let's kick it off with

34
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
Did you buy anything

35
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
I didn't attend this might be the

36
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:59,040
First time in ages that I didn't my son got a good deal on

37
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:03,904
Amazon Echo tap I can for $79

38
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,208
K-129 from mine

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,536
But other than that I don't

40
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
All right I bought

41
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
An Amazon

42
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,168
And the reason and we talked about this a little bit last week

43
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,056
Is the Echo Show that's downstairs in our kitchen living room area it doesn't seem to pick up my voice

44
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:27,456
As well as the original cylinder so my husband was like you know what I don't want that downstairs it's utility is not as great for

45
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,784
I had already given the

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,856
Amazon Echo cylinder to my daughter and I didn't want to steal it back

47
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
Apparently didn't want to put the show in

48
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
That's a No-No

49
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
So

50
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,304
I'm not moving to show to my office

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,608
So if anyone wants to drop in during off

52
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
Flowers

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
Actually that

54
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,448
Brings me to this idea

55
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
The show for drop in

56
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
Should have office hours

57
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Chris Lake

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,432
When I'm sitting here at my desk working

59
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,992
I actually have no problem with a wide variety

60
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
Anyway

61
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,392
So back to that so we bought the original Echo

62
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
For $90

63
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
And

64
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,328
That's it that's a good deal I mean if you wanted a

65
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,912
If you wanted an Amazon device of any kind

66
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,984
Whether it's a tablet or an echo

67
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,776
The deals were fantastic

68
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:29,920
Yeah nothing else really jumped out of there was some smart home deals but none of them

69
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
Expedia

70
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
So I am going to let you know

71
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Mother

72
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,416
I don't know how it taste like these tiny little sensors attached to it

73
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:45,024
It's a cute seahub it's it looks like an upside down light bulb with little :-) on it

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
French OK it's

75
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,656
Self expression

76
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
Necklaces that say

77
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
It's sophisticated it will ignore you

78
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
I will not turn on your light

79
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
Right now I'm busy

80
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
I have other things

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
That was my Russian

82
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,296
Mother is on sale for $99 for the

83
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,856
Hot it normally is 299

84
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
So this is actually

85
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
Good deal

86
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
And I think I'm going to buy one

87
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,791
I had played with this probably three or four years ago

88
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
It what I was a kid

89
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,143
And I wrote about it that I thought this was

90
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
A really great hub for

91
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:30,079
People who don't want to connect smart devices they just want to know where stuff is happening or where it is in the

92
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,639
Their house is very sensor Centric

93
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Yes

94
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,015
And for 99 bucks plus you can get a package of four different kinds of sensors

95
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Call peanuts

96
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
How cute is that

97
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,671
Horrible date they really are

98
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
Battery life

99
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Applebee's

100
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
When I tried it out UK

101
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Reach

102
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
Hard

103
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
I'm trying to remember how that worked

104
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
I do remember

105
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
They have

106
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
The sensors that are little bit more generic

107
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
And then they have

108
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,103
The peanuts and there's three kinds of peanuts there's a guard peanut

109
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
I'm thermopeanut

110
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
And a

111
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
And so

112
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,575
Those have special algorithms on them that track things like sleep

113
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:17,183
Or ambient temperature changes in car peanut tracks like when stuff moves basic

114
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
And then I have some more generic

115
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Stead

116
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
Also track those

117
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Specific

118
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
And basically

119
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
I really liked this

120
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,287
I noticed they had an activity tracking peanut at when I tested it out and that was not good

121
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
But it did not track that

122
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Accurately

123
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,919
I tried to sleep peanut and that was okay

124
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
But I think

125
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,527
I would try it again measured against my Fitbit

126
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,087
Because sleep tracking has gotten a lot better than

127
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,623
The last time I tested this

128
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,671
And they had a prescription

129
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:54,303
Like a potion peanut that tracked motion and I put that on a pill bottle to make sure I was taking my medicine every day

130
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
That was actually really handy

131
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,399
Because it would send a notification

132
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
If I hadn't taken it

133
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
By a certain time

134
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Red so

135
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
I don't know

136
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,639
I ate a good deal at 99 much better do obviously the 299 this is not a prime deal this is

137
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Direct

138
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
Purchase steel from mother

139
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
From Central

140
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
Sense

141
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
Dot-dot essay

142
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Not to be confused with

143
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
Hello shenzhen

144
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,695
Businessman

145
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Electricity

146
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
It actually saying going-out-of-business reminds me so why do you think this is discounted I hate to think you can go there

147
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,519
They're still active on their accounts

148
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,943
And one of the things I really like about them they don't sell the data

149
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:47,039
They specifically say your date is your day that you can delete it from our

150
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,367
Servers at a time if you're done with it

151
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,183
At least I thought I had an in terms of that from

152
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
Take us back from day one

153
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,767
Yes I think it's part of their

154
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
They are French

155
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
At my other favorite French Camp

156
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
Netatmo and they don't share

157
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
So

158
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
You know if you want to build a French Smart Home

159
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
This is not about

160
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
We do not share

161
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
Speaking of

162
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,295
I I I wanted to do the speaking of French

163
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:27,231
Segway that she tried

164
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
I just now you'll say people don't worry

165
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
For this moment

166
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
Going back to Amazon

167
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:40,543
Amazon has launched smart home consulting services in Chinese

168
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
Seattle Portland

169
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
Price of California

170
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
Not in Texas City

171
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
Philadelphia

172
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
But

173
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,247
What it is is you can hire this

174
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,623
Amazon expert

175
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
Set up

176
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,207
Madam a smart home

177
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
I don't know what do you think

178
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:07,167
I think Best Buy is not happy with the Geek Squad because they do the same thing and BestBuy stock took a hit

179
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,751
As soon as this news hit the waves so that's not good

180
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,103
I don't know any I get it it's an a potential

181
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
Revenue Edition

182
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,807
Stream for Amazon part of me says the products themselves are designed in a way that their prey

183
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,111
Pretty simple to set up and

184
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,487
I mean I almost want to say if you need the service Amazon fail at the design

185
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
I don't think they did

186
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
Well okay

187
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
So I think people listening to the show

188
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Probably not

189
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
The audience for this

190
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
I got a lot of people who

191
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
They're like

192
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
I don't want this it looks sneaky

193
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,359
I don't know where to go from

194
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
But I have an Amazon Echo

195
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
I want to set up smart

196
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
Light switch smart lights do I buy

197
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,039
So this is actually

198
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,855
This could help Amazon

199
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Yeah

200
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Any more thing

201
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
In

202
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,767
I should say we should because they don't sell enough things today

203
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,095
This boost value

204
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,935
Cuz if you're just using Echo and I think

205
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,007
Was it most people use it still is a kitchen timer

206
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,311
If you just use it as that

207
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,199
We actually got data from

208
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Talking about

209
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,319
Boy stuff and it's worth bringing in now because it's super

210
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,159
Let's talk about some of the things we establish

211
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
Don't you have a voice assistant

212
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
You actually

213
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Which I was like

214
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,495
Yeah in a sense this data are going to talk about a second isn't

215
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,079
Shocking but it reinforces the idea that people are using

216
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
This voice assistant

217
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,431
Exactly what they were designed for as well as other

218
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,479
Pictures but mainly for

219
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
For that the key features

220
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,319
Yes it is sampled 1500 if

221
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Pretty

222
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
Self-selecting

223
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
People Like Us

224
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
Does the smart home show

225
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Sorry about that

226
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,607
All right

227
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Us

228
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
Who have

229
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
All these devices so 62%

230
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
People

231
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,543
Who own an Amazon Echo or Google home

232
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
Home Smart lighting

233
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:27,199
42% also owns smart thermostats in 40%

234
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
I want to Smart Hub

235
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
So that's

236
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
Pretty high

237
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,855
Jeff

238
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,951
Yeah I mean that the hubsan assistance themselves are useful

239
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,791
But obviously they're far more useful as you add more things right

240
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,631
The reason people bought these things

241
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
78

242
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,959
I'm a 79% markup to stream music

243
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,775
70% control Smart lighting

244
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,103
And so what's crazy to me is there actually using it

245
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
For what they think

246
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,967
75%

247
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Music

248
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,319
Well 60% control Smart lighting so there's a little Gap there

249
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
So maybe Amazon wants to

250
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
Clothes that capital

251
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
This is among the more sophisticated people

252
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,815
Right said what's interesting also is going along with the whole

253
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
Ecosystem aspect of it

254
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:22,751
91% of those surveyed say that their system has made them more likely to buy another connected device in the future

255
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
So that obviously I can't get to the

256
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
Add more items to it

257
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,663
And I thought this was kind of interesting because a lot of people

258
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
He's just having a conversation on Twitter with somebody about

259
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
Amazon's hardware for

260
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
It's Darius

261
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
Smart devices

262
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:42,975
98% of if users believe they'll still be in their voice assistance 5 years

263
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:48,095
I get a lot of questions about yesterday add that to the hardware like no

264
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
The hardware itself isn't

265
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
The thing that's going to evolve at this point

266
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
It's

267
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
The software is

268
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,543
The service is it's what they can connect to

269
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
So I totally

270
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Agree with that

271
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,895
Vast majority if users that say that

272
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,503
You don't Amazon built this with relatively at the time

273
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
The latest and greatest

274
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
Hot diggity chips and this isn't a product that

275
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
Requires this and that

276
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,767
It's a really interesting way to think about building

277
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,327
For the whole because these devices

278
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,679
Especially not that connecting your devices to the Amazon is hard

279
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,519
If you think about adding more of it like replacing

280
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
Connected home devices

281
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
It's not something people want

282
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
Yeah and it's

283
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
It's actually anime B

284
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
Wrong here I'm picking up

285
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Stop my head

286
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
I think it's one of the most widely adopted

287
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
Consumer Cloud devices

288
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,975
Because really that's what it's doing it's better I don't need the heavy-duty Hardware

289
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
Everything is taking place in the cloud

290
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
Rethink mainstream people how many

291
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,119
Millions of these devices are out there now

292
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
That's a real Testament to to clock

293
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
Computing on the consumer level

294
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
For everybody

295
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Hello

296
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:08,991
Mother incense how important is integration with your voice assistant when choosing a connected device 60%

297
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
2% said somewhat

298
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
Yeah

299
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,719
Yeah that's interesting

300
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:23,839
Also related miles apart in here now I just got to study from Walker Sands community

301
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
Haitians

302
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,191
Saying that they did at a future of retail

303
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
Study

304
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:35,359
And they say that nearly one-in-five consumers has made a voice purchase through an echo or other voice control devices

305
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,199
And another 33%

306
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
Set a ties into the hole

307
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
The shopping aspect

308
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
Things to

309
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
Although I would say

310
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
I didn't realize this would happen

311
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
Cuz I'm a space cadet

312
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
Where's my Amazon

313
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Comprende

314
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
Through

315
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
And I got a $10 credit

316
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Yes

317
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,887
That was that was part of the deal

318
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
So I guess I paid $80

319
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
Now

320
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,871
Back to selling connected devices which is this Amazon thing is

321
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
Probably mostly about

322
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Apple

323
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
Has created

324
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
A retail experience

325
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
The Smart Home

326
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
Antique stores

327
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,391
Obviously based on homekit

328
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,791
I saw this and I was like well of course it did

329
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Cuz you need this

330
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:33,215
To sell the smart home and then I instantly thought of retail smart home efforts out there

331
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,543
We can pick it off with staples connect which was our first

332
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
Which is now

333
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
Ring

334
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,111
That company first came to my attention because they built this

335
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,439
Connected store experience for Staples

336
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
And that did not go well

337
00:14:54,975 --> 00:15:01,119
The thing is it was a great way to Showcase surprise fantastic demo is gave you ideas of ways to use the

338
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
The Hub and connected devices

339
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,471
So I don't think it's failed because of the

340
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
In-store demo metal

341
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
I think people just didn't

342
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
By there

343
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
Products from

344
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Staples

345
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
Hangout

346
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Experiment

347
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,807
It down in San Francisco across the street from Moscone

348
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,111
I actually this year revamped it

349
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:28,767
It's more like a beta store concept where you actually play with things cuz the original concept was to show all these connected devices

350
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
This working together

351
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,351
And I had this like clear lucite

352
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
Furniture

353
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,215
Getting all these connected products and there was a really

354
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
Demo coneria but

355
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
Be kind of tweak that

356
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
Because

357
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
It's something I felt like a smart home is not

358
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,175
It's not coming together for

359
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,015
That's another retail

360
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Concept

361
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
AOL

362
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
In the beta store

363
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,415
Is going well but they don't show it like

364
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
They don't show Smart Home Stuff working

365
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Like the integration

366
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
Watsons store

367
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,327
So yeah so with the Apple I'm curious what you think of

368
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
What they're doing

369
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
I'm not sure if

370
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,543
I'm not sure either I think it's

371
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
28 stores around the

372
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Country

373
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:21,503
Not including Union Square in San Francisco World Trade Center and Williamsburg

374
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,575
I guess and then 15 stores outside of the US

375
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,183
How much did you say a non-interactive homekit experience will be out at all of that

376
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
So

377
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,047
At least you'll get to see things to play with them

378
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,679
This is the kind of product you have to demo you have to show off you have to let people play in

379
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,543
Hit a button to make a light go on and say okay to get them thinking about how they can use it so

380
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
I think it's a brilliant play I just

381
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:51,967
I still feel that homekit does not have the momentum of other platforms for

382
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
Various reasons

383
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
And by having a special section

384
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:00,159
The store that's focused on homekit

385
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:06,559
We're finally ready and with the homepod launching in December it could be that they're like going to build this

386
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
In-store

387
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,143
Ecosystem like that

388
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Amazon is trying

389
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
To do with

390
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
The echo

391
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,871
I could see that and I could also see them doing their one-on-one training and Group Training like I do

392
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,175
For all their other products that's a big thing that

393
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,503
San Amazon can't do because they don't have a physical presence

394
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,367
Bread

395
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,903
Haven't used homekit

396
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
It is

397
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
Freaking easy

398
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
The biggest

399
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,023
Catches in homekit

400
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,839
Things up is going to be actually how you names

401
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Understand you

402
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
So

403
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,703
I can actually see a year from now

404
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:51,103
Is the products are super compelling and maybe they offer install for some of the more complicated things like light switch

405
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,991
I can see this actually being kind of a cool thing for apple and getting homekit more Wiley.

406
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,551
I'm not a huge fan but you know it could happen

407
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:06,463
It could I I don't see them ever actually getting into installation may be contracted out but they don't

408
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
Think so cuz they like that control everything

409
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,071
I think it's more about showing how to use it

410
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
Anything else

411
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,215
Because it works across their entire product line on the mobile side new iPads

412
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,751
IPhones Apple watch

413
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
So you throw all those in the next

414
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,151
Chances are a customer has one or multiple one or more of those things

415
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,247
To show how easy it works across other devices probably what they're going to highlight

416
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
That sounds

417
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
Appellee

418
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,183
Awesome

419

Louis Vuitton

425
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
Sure

426
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,311
Fancy maker of luggage and leather goods

Oh Lewis

431
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
No no no

432
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
So

433
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
So

434
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
Let's talk about what it is

435
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,879
First they came out with

436
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,183
3 smart watches that are

437
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,743
Uniquely designed when you when you look at

438
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
Most smart watches today there

439
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
I know

440
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,119
I want a cookie cutter but they're very similar

441
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:21,727
So this is slightly different than maybe the other SmartWatches use singing and then that's fine

442
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:27,615
Button inside of course it's a Qualcomm chip and it's running Google Android Wear software so it's

443
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,199
Functionally and technically no different than

444
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,039
$99 or $200 Android Wear watch you can buy today

445
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:40,415
Of course being Louis Vuitton this is not $99 this is going to start at

446
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,719
2400

447
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
50

448
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
Dollars and steel and the

449
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,095
A black version of it is $2,900

450
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
So

451
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
A Japanese

452
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Smart Home

453
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,727
Yeah for a year I mean

454
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,543
Yeah I get listen I get

455
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,847
Fashion luxury brands

456
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,431
In certain products I do I get it and I spent

457
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
Some good money in sky

458
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:09,343
Yeah and I spent some good money on a Tissot or some other while call low and

459
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,159
Not luxury watches you know but nice watches

460
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:17,279
When it comes to Tech I don't see the fashion brands

461
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,351
Working and then tag or has already tried this

462
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
With

463
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
2

464
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
Android watches

465
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,263
And in fact it was Emma's $1,500 I think for the first one that tag are sold

466
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:32,127
And they I think they knew that it was a stretch because they even gave you the option of getting

467
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,407
A mechanical

468
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,735
Insert that you would take the Smartwatch out and put the mechanical

469
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
Tag Heuer watch

470
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,087
Automatic movement into the

471
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
Band

472
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,415
And now they give you both of them for one price

473
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,999
I I just don't see a massive market for this

474
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
And I think that's okay

475
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
Their standards

476
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
What I'm saying

477
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,679
20th century

478
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,263
It didn't mean we were going to turn into Boeing or Airbus

479
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,383
But are they part of that conversation now

480
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
Swellinfo

481
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,711
And that's the question

482
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:12,319
Is fashion going to take over wearables or is

483
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,623
Tech going to take over

484
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
That side of

485
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
Red fashion

486
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
In route

487
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,280
I would be sad like I would love to see

488
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,864
A Qualcomm dresses reference designs for

489
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
Fashion companies in fossil did by

490
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,216
Misfit wearables

491
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:33,568
I'm in his integrating some of that technology into straight up Fossil Watches Witcher

492
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,896
Dino stretch of the imagination super high-end

493
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,688
I like ideas having

494
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,480
A wearable that Ida strap-on

495
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,528
To my wrist and just

496
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,368
Mashing it to my outfit I think the challenge has been

497
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
On the software side

498
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,744
If I don't wear the same watch everyday

499
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,560
Put something else on it I wanted to just talk to

500
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
One app

501
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
Right

502
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
In what is it

503
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
That actually

504
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,776
Outside of price or anything else I think is what's holding back

505
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
More

506
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Fashion

507
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
Gerbils

508
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:15,552
I would agree with him and you can anything Jazz things up with bands watch bands and so on

509
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,112
A failed experiment hearing is not one of the companies that we

510
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
Just talked about

511
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,976
It was the original $10,000 Apple watch

512
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
They don't sell it anymore

513
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
Wow

514
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
I can't imagine why not

515
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:35,008
I mean that to me that was like we're going to try and do the the fashion luxury brand

516
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
Addition

517
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,080
And I'm sure they sold a couple of them

518
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:42,176
But they don't sell them anymore than the most expensive one now is

519
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,480
I don't know maybe $1,500

520
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,320
Wiltshire I mean and that's a lot you didn't get it it's ceramic

521
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,880
You know I got the stainless steel model

522
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,928
My Apple watch was 599 when the

523
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,744
399 aluminum one would have been just fine it

524
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
They're out of him and I

525
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
Didn't want to wait Bass

526
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
Whatever

527
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,376
I don't know why I don't see it at

528
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
The other thing is

529
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
There's a hole

530
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,240
I'll call it an underground market for

531
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:12,640
Developers who create and I know this is not legal but they create watch faces digital watch faces that mimic

532
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:17,504
That's fancy to the 5,000 or $10,000 luxury brand watches

533
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:22,368
So if you want to Rolex watch base you know what you can buy for $0.99 you know until

534
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,696
Shut it down and they just pop up somewhere else

535
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,024
So I just don't think it's worth it for these companies to

536
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
Do this and I think

537
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,632
Take me to find that out should just do a

538
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
Affordable

539
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
Custom watch face

540
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
$30

541
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,312
I mean you'd probably get more sales of that then

542
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,640
Then watch it $20 box

543
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,528
I'm really excited

544
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,576
Because I am a networking

545
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
Is Misha

546
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
I can't say his name I'm sorry Michelle

547
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
I am terrible

548
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,536
But she is a co-founder of a company called Open Garden

549
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,352
Which is a peer-to-peer messaging

550
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
For smartphones

551
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,704
He actually started a new company called no.

552
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:14,592
And this company is basically trying to create a location tracking Network for iot

553
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,944
You know you guys know that I'm super high on location tracking

554
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,088
And they're running software

555
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,744
So The Challenge location tracking and iot is it is really expensive if you use cellular and that uses batteries

556
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,328
Companies like tile and tracker

557
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,352
Things like

558
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,656
There is

559
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,008
You have to have a pretty phenomenal Network

560
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
Closer to real time

561
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,640
Applications if you're out in the middle of nowhere

562
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,200
Tile app installed in your phone

563
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,528
It's basically a crowd-sourced network essentially

564
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
So

565
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,856
Side deal with nodal is

566
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:01,184
That instead of just helping consumers by these devices

567
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,000
They're actually paying Developers

568
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
To put

569
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,096
Their software into

570
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,656
Popular apps that use Bluetooth

571
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:15,520
And then so the network gets bigger faster and us there's more utility

572
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
Location track

573
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,360
So this isn't a consumer-oriented

574
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
To think it's like

575
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:24,224
Getting developers and then they're going to sell access to this network

576
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
Which

577
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,320
Building networks is always hard

578
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,112
Never easy

579
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,416
But I am really fascinated

580
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,488
Buy this idea in because

581
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,768
I followed Open Garden

582
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,400
I love the way they're thinking and I think that we've had it on a couple of shows ago this idea of

583
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
Building a truly distributed Network

584
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
For iot

585
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,616
I don't know it's interesting approach

586
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
So yeah so

587
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,480
Guys go check out noodle I'm going to write about it more in this week

588
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
Because I love it

589
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,088
I think that's it

590
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:06,720
This section the new section of the show and that's why the message from our sponsor and then

591
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
Alex

592
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,560
Lighthouse talking about

593
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,544
For computer vision so stay tuned for all that we are taking a break from the

594
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,432
Internet of Things podcast from our sponsor this week sponsor is Allegiant

595
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,968
The maker of Schlage Locks

596
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
Rob Martin

597
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,088
Who is a futuristic

598
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,136
Guys Rob is actually friend

599
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,672
Very smart women

600
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
X to the smart

601
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:43,328
Different questions

602
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,632
Intro to him cuz he thinks about this

603
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,192
Not just as a consumer but also as a company that makes

604
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,544
I want to make my home smart

605
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
What should I buy

606
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Bye

607
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:59,200
Devices based on what it is specifically designed to do not what you hope it can

608
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,272
There's a lot of interesting use cases out there

609
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,576
But if you go shopping and are kind of

610
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
Floating

611
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,976
Looking for something cool you're not necessarily going to get something that's practical for you day today

612
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
All right

613
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
So

614
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,328
There's a lot about security how should I be thinking about

615
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
Security

616
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:21,472
Well there are lots of things to consider with security and it's not just cyber

617
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
Obviously with all

618
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,568
Ransomware attacks and other things going on it's a

619
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,848
Big consideration

620
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,456
But you should also think about the physical security when it comes to a product like ours

621
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,760
Locks is that Hardware Graydon

622
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,832
In other words does it have a bhma rating

623
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,648
That allows you to have the best security

624
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
Durability and function

625
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
Personality in the product

626
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
Perspective

627
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:50,656
I always look for over the air update if your device is not able to take on new technology whether that be in the

628
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,704
Form of new firmware

629
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,568
New applications and other things not only are you probably missing out on some new functionality

630
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:02,432
But you're probably missing out on some of the most important security updates that you're going to need

631
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
Now you mentioned

632
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,248
To bhma

633
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
Grading

634
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
And I have no idea what that is

635
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:12,928
Bhma stands for builders hardware manufacturers

636
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Association

637
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,792
And so what it is is a residential lock grading system

638
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,584
So it's broken into three

639
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Components

640
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
Security

641
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,168
Durability in Finnish

642
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,240
So security is what it sounds like it's a measure of safety

643
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:30,592
But there's some cool components in there things like Sledgehammer attacks

644
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
Attempts to manually

645
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
Call the lock from the door or

646
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:38,016
Wait like a child hanging from a door lever or something like that

647
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,064
The second element is durability

648
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,624
So that's a measure of functionality

649
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
So for example

650
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,184
Working at Estes

651
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
2

652
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
The equivalent of 100 Year life

653
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
And making sure that the

654
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
The Mechanicals are still working

655
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,096
And then finish

656
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,912
So finishes the measure of resilience against

657
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Elements

658
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,496
So you know scratching wear-and-tear salt

659
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,056
Humidity UV rays all that good stuff

660
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,896
Wow so do you have a sledgehammer test room or you guys beat your

661
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,736
We do so if you look at our sense product

662
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:15,136
Or our connect product both of our touchscreen deadbolt their aaa-rated bhma which means they get the

663
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
Top rating

664
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,256
Across those categories I just mentioned security durability and finish

665
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
Awesome

666
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,328
Where can I go to find out

667
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,400
Stay so you can find me on schlage.com

668
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:31,264
Slashdot leadership or on Twitter my handle is at Schleich futurist

669
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,224
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast

670
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,040
This is your host Stacey Higginbotham

671
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
Is Alex

672
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,416
Who is the CEO and co-founder of lighthouse

673
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,208
Hi Alex how are you doing

674
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
Good morning Stacy Angie

675
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,328
Thank you so much for coming on the show today

676
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,120
We are very excited to talk about

677
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,960
3D sensing let's get started with a real quick

678
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
3D sensing

679
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
So

680
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
Laid out for me

681
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
What is

682
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
3D sensing

683
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,408
Is a relatively new kind of sensor

684
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
So you can think of

685
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,248
I kind of like a camera

686
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,808
Rather than a camera that sees colors

687
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
In the worlds the way we're used to

688
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,904
We are used to perceiving the world

689
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
Discount received

690
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:28,096
Things like at every point it will say hey that's off lights and 3.72 meters away dark brown

691
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,632
And that's 2.85 me

692
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
Anchors Aweigh

693
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,192
And you get that for the whole field of vision

694
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,472
For this kind of

695
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,776
Kelly changes what you can do

696
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
With computer vision games

697
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
Like how

698
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,664
So the short version is that 3D sensing

699
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
Essentially

700
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:46,016
Makes many difficult some problems of computer vision

701
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,088
Substantially easier or relatively trivial to solve

702
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,136
Not also problems of computer vision

703
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
But many of them

704
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:56,512
Interesting topics to

705
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,048
To look at it to think about because

706
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,584
People are so good at division

707
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,216
Like our brains are so good at Vision that we never think about how hard it actually is

708
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:10,080
Using any extra technique you can to make that problem easier

709
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
Anthony something is just want to be

710
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,712
Okay so it does things like the ability to track distance

711
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,016
And not just color it just shape of

712
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,368
A computer to understand if I'm walking

713
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,904
Towards it or away from it

714
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,440
But it might also that it

715
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
Understand

716
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,304
Like how I'm walking into a relation of a room like these are kind of the things I'm

717
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,864
What is what these subproblems are

718
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:37,728
One good example here is that moving shadows and changing lighting conditions

719
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,264
Common

720
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,544
It starts at confusion

721
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,128
Four typical computer vision systems that use just regular color camera

722
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:48,480
And would you have a 3D sensor those moving shadows and changing lighting position

723
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,040
They're not changes in the 3D structure of the inventor

724
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
So they don't confuse

725
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,624
You can imagine the sensor

726
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,208
Essentially giving you a full 3D model of the environment

727
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,792
This is used widely in self-driving cars

728
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
Because

729
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,888
Having that direct access to a

730
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,960
Real-time stream of the 3D structure of the environment

731
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:15,616
Exactly what made it possible to finish the self-driving car races back in 2005 and 2007 in the dark

732
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Lego

733
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
Okay so

734
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,736
You guys have

735
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
Taking the sense

736
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:28,672
And you have made it smaller and stuck it not in the car but in a camera for people's homes

737
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
And

738
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,976
Tell us a little bit more about

739
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,280
Lighthouse and why you started it

740
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:37,120
That's right the lighthouses I do kind of interactive assist

741
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,448
You can tell it what you care about

742
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,752
And it will tell you when those things happen

743
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:48,896
For example you can say let me know if you don't see the kids by 4 p.m.

744
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,432
And it understands what

745
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
Children look like

746
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:57,088
It makes use of this 3D sensing capabilities to to be able to understand what a child actually is

747
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,928
What time it is and if it doesn't see any children by 4 p.m.

748
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,232
And then you can go check in and make sure that everything

749
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
Okay

750
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,816
Because there's a lot of things happen

751
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,864
It sounds so easy

752
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
Are simple

753
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
So you got more accurate

754
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Peter vision

755
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,568
Is that a decent way to say it

756
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,128
False positive

757
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,176
Dramatically increase

758
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,224
Capabilities

759
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,064
Camera with superpowers you've also got

760
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
Natural language processing

761
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,880
You've got

762
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
Some sort of

763
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:38,816
Programming in the back and see if I don't then I need to do this what else

764
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
Might be back there

765
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,632
Deep learning is the other really big

766
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,216
The way we think about the the really the really gnarly

767
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,264
Computer vision problems that were tackling

768
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,592
It's this combination of 3D sensing and deep learning

769
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,872
That really makes it go

770
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,688
And in particular gets its recurrent neural networks

771
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,992
That are analyzing time series data

772
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,272
Navigate from

773
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:02,112
Maybe worth mentioning 3D sensing one of those some problems that we talked about

774
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
Is

775
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,672
Fighting the segmentation about Jack

776
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:08,256
Right understanding that like hey this is where the subject begins and ends

777
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
And

778
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
Something it doesn't know what it is yet

779
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:23,360
And then the neural network will take a look at that

780
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,152
Running to the house this looks like a dog

781
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,968
Is there training associated with your camera

782
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
Like if I am a user

783
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,344
The short answer is no there's not almost everything works out of the box

784
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,928
The one thing that the user does have to set up

785
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,232
Because we don't know who is who

786
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,048
When like we arrived in your house for the first time

787
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,608
Right

788
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,984
So that one parts that user has to set up everything else works out of the box

789
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
Okay

790
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,848
So walk me through a day in the life with this camera so

791
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,664
People get a sense of How It's a little bit different

792
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
And some of the other things out on them

793
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:06,368
There's a very broad spectrum of things that that Lighthouse is capable of still one is the saying hey if you don't see the kids by 4 p.m. let me know

794
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,952
But you can do similar things for say the dog walker

795
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,280
He's working right now actually

796
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,632
But you say tell me if you don't see anyone with the dog at the front door on weekday after

797
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:24,032
It understands what you're asking for it understands what a dog looks like it and understands what a person looks like

798
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,336
And if it doesn't see those two things together

799
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
In Jessica's front door camera

800
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,408
Then it will let her know

801
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,712
When everything is happening normally in her home

802
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:36,320
But when something is out of the ordinary for some reason the dog walker hasn't shown up

803
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,624
Then

804
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,976
Is pretty exciting for a lot of different people with a lot of different

805
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:43,744
Specific problem

806
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:48,608
So we heard things like coffee shop owner doesn't especially want to get there at 5 a.m.

807
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:52,704
To like to open things up everyday and would really like to know that you know.

808
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,312
Let me know if you like don't see anyone there

809
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:03,712
By 5 a.m. and like it understands what people look like and it didn't understand the time constraints and it will it will actually

810
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
Do with us this coffee shop

811
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,832
And similarly for elderly care

812
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:13,440
His mother lived alone in Germany and

813
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,232
This kind of capability

814
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,768
Really useful to know

815
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,792
Hayden szeto

816
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,328
Eczema

817
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,680
And if not I should know about it so I can give her a ring and just make sure everything is okay

818
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,728
And she has this arrangement

819
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,752
Spell incredible

820
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,032
Security camera

821
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,592
Now the ability just said to check in on what's going on there

822
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
Let me go back to your

823
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
Coffee shop

824
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,920
Example because this

825
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,200
This is kind of interesting

826
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,224
Commercial applications

827
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
Or maybe even four

828
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,784
Me and my favorite

829
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,088
Coffee shop I would love to be able to say

830
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,392
If there are more than 30 people

831
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,696
At my coffee shop that is so tiny

832
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
And has

833
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,024
Let me know

834
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,840
Haha or some variation of that

835
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,400
And you know that would be really interesting from an

836
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,936
App perspective like

837
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
That would get me

838
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
I totally to download

839
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
Coffee shop

840
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,312
So is that something that you guys can

841
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
Can do or that

842
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,384
Maybe you're not doing today but might

843
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Do some other time

844
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,456
Cuz I'm not something you do just yet

845
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,760
But that's absolutely in scope

846
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,040
The kinds of problems

847
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,576
We're interested in solid

848
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,136
Will basically be guided by what

849
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,440
What are customers asked for

850
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,280
And we'll stick with other opportunities for a minute

851
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Come back to the home

852
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,096
There's also a really interesting

853
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,888
Location with things like

854
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,168
Oh tracking

855
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,216
Because it understands relationships

856
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Space

857
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:34,592
Tracking packages or maybe offering better ways to load trucks and that's what

858
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
So are you Siri

859
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:41,248
You said commercial or small business interest but are you seeing interest or could this be applied

860
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
Really Broad

861
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Or are there other

862
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
But he's doing it

863
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:51,488
This kind of interactive assistance were reduced you tell it what you care about that you make a request of it

864
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:55,072
Admit it take some action on your behalf or circuses some data for you

865
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,632
As far as we know nobody else is doing this

866
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:03,008
The closest comparable here is something like Alexa or one of the other Home assistants better

867
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Speaker Bass

868
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,336
They're extraordinarily good for playing music

869
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:10,944
And a few other things like asking factual sorts of questions about the world you know what is the nest

870
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
Subway this kind of

871
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,648
Like interactive assistant

872
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,952
And let's go to your business model

873
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:25,280
Because it's it's a little bit interesting so the camera itself

874
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,560
That cost except

875
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,632
And then there's also a service fee associated

876
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
Set monthly

877
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
Yearly

878
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,984
We are about sanya mentally we are in AI

879
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,824
We have to build Hardware to get there that Hardware component is essential but

880
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,360
But really what we are providing

881
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,896
Is this this amazing

882
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:46,272
So that the hardware is $299 and then it's $10 a month or $100 a year

883
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,808
Fournier service

884
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:51,904
Okay and everything goes to the cloud which some people get a little freaked out about

885
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,440
So let's talk about your security

886
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,744
So we understand that

887
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,096
Nail trust is essential to this product

888
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,888
Bankrate

889
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:06,752
Security across the board so for example every connection between the device

890
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,544
And your phone in the back end

891
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,824
Stop those are all encrypted

892
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,128
With industry-leading techniques

893
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,176
TLS with 2048-bit keys

894
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,968
Aes-256 session

895
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,248
Kitchen

896
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,040
Is encrypted at rest in the back end

897
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,576
Software on the device

898
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,368
Is awesome cryptographically secure

899
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,976
So like that software running on there has to be signed by our product key for a cat run

900
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,256
Angle do things like

901
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,304
Shutdown Bluetooth connection

902
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
When they're not needed

903
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,632
It's like that's what that's not leave that open

904
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:40,032
As a channel to be tested by people with malicious intent

905
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,616
That has been a recent

906
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,176
A recent hack two people have been exploding

907
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
Separate

908
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,528
How do you help users

909
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,880
Because some of this is things like password so I'm curious how you helped users

910
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:55,904
Perhaps

911
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,928
Be better

912
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,256
At security and force them to do things better a little bit

913
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
More rigorous didn't

914
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,840
The hell yes

915
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,912
I'm glad you asked that actually it is another explicit thing we do there

916
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,704
It's a technique of key stretching

917
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,240
Login time

918
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:16,640
We're not just sending your username and password over the the encrypted Channel where we're actually running York

919
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Password

920
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:21,504
Through essentially inexpensive hash function that many many times

921
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,528
There's a lot of

922
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,344
Computer work that your phone has to do that login time

923
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:30,464
And so what does. It is not something you can circumvent you like you have to

924
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,280
Do that Taki station if you want to to login

925
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,120
So for a regular user login you don't really notice anything

926
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:42,752
That delay and that's just like this normally just ask Fades into the background of everything else

927
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:49,152
What's happening but if you if you were to try oh I want to run 10,000 random passwords in like see if I can get into your account

928
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,432
Especially Yours

929
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,712
Weak passwords

930
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,248
That are commonly used

931
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,832
That would be very hard. It would take a lot of computational effort

932
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,648
Essentially makes your password login

933
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:03,232
Significantly more secure

934
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,048
Pacific star that's pbkdf2

935
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,096
For people who are so inclined

936
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
Right on

937
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,472
Peanut butter jelly

938
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,496
3 +

939
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,032
K peanut butter and

940
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,128
Crafts

941
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
Okay

942
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,688
Let's talk about

943
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:28,832
The fun stuff here so we're going to we're going to continue on our nerdy journey into

944
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,880
3D sensors because I love

945
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,904
I love new sensors

946
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,952
Genuinely

947
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,744
On the lookout for them because

948
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,328
Every time you add a new sensor you add a new capability

949
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,120
To basically the Internet of Things

950
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,168
And this is a monster

951
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,704
Capabilities

952
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
Computer vision

953
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,520
So let's talk about

954
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
The trade-offs here

955
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:53,407
You guys had your specifically designed the optical piece for the sensor

956
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,967
Where is design for you it's custom

957
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,527
So what is the sensor made of and what are sky

958
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,855
What is it actually measuring and how should I think about the pros and cons

959
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:02,879
Ascensor

960
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,695
It is custom objects in a custom objects module for us

961
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,535
And the general principle here is that it's a time of flight camera

962
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,095
That's one of several different types of 3D sensors

963
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:17,471
Roughly speaking at a high-level what's happening is we're sending out modulated lights

964
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,495
Is it the environment

965
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,055
So you can think of that as just like it's turning on and off

966
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:21,823
Very rapid

967
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,127
And then we look at

968
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:28,991
Basically how long it takes for that to come back and the fact that it modulated lets you measure that

969
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,039
In a fairly cost-effective way

970
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,855
Essentially looking for a spaceships between

971
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,135
The output signal

972
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,207
A reference signal and The Returned

973
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,863
Did you know when you sent the dogs and you can say alright in the analog circuitry here like figure out you know how much are these two signals

974
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
Overlapping

975
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:49,727
And then that tells you how long it actually took for it to go out and come back

976
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,263
And then you know how far away are

977
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,823
Hey does this reverie Point Indiana

978
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,639
So this is kind of like sonar

979
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,199
You can think of it a little bit like sonar

980
00:42:59,455 --> 00:42:59,967
But with lights

981
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,783
But it's a particularly clever

982
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,087
Way of stuff measuring just

983
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,647
Soap with someone you're typically

984
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:11,487
Actually just measuring your like starting a stopwatch and then stopping the stopwatch

985
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:16,351
To to measure how long something goes out how long something takes for the signal to go out and come back

986
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,679
But with this it's not just like start the stopwatch and then stopped

987
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
The stopwatch

988
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:27,103
Because light goes so quickly would be on the order of ghetto nanoseconds that you have to measure and you can do that but

989
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
It's pretty expensive

990
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:32,479
Actually the kind of sensor that is used on self-driving cars

991
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,783
Is that Google actually just measure

992
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,623
Directly that amount of time with essentially the stopwatch method

993
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,671
And that's all

994
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,999
That's also based on

995
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:44,767
Collimated

996
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
Lazarbeam

997
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,327
Going out to the environment

998
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,119
We coming back where this is diffusely

999
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,191
Instead of the stopwatch method

1000
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,215
It's more like

1001
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,287
Look at how much these two different signals overlap

1002
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,079
That if they overlap a lot

1003
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:02,943
That it didn't take very much time for the signal to go out and come back and they overlap just a little bit

1004
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,991
That must have taken a long time for

1005
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,551
This is awesome so

1006
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,855
Your camera is is somewhat expense

1007
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,951
I mean it's not like break the bank expensive but it's definitely up there in the

1008
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,975
The IP camera work

1009
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,999
I know it's smarter

1010
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,815
But how much of that like how expensive

1011
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,839
Are the sensor

1012
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,119
Can I stick this in

1013
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,167
Just listen by how much they are

1014
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,191
Because that's going to dictate

1015
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
What I can use them

1016
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:30,591
It's fair to say they are more expensive than a traditional camera there is more going on

1017
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,735
But they're not prohibitively expensive like it is possible for us to sell things at 299

1018
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,759
How do you say

1019
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,783
A wonderful

1020
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,087
But we had to work very hard

1021
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
To get it to that price

1022
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,647
There's no question

1023
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,695
And what about power consumption

1024
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,487
Is this a giant powerhawk

1025
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:50,559
It's not a joint but it's not something

1026
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
You would tell her with that

1027
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:56,703
All right we talked about consumer use we talked about crazy ideas for business

1028
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,263
And this is actually what you guys are filters

1029
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,823
One part of an entire category

1030
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,103
A 3D sensing

1031
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
So

1032
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,175
What else is there in the

1033
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,223
So we got a timer

1034
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:14,367
Cancer and two particular other options there for 3D sensing include structured lights and Laser Rangefinder

1035
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,159
Into a structured light system

1036
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,719
What that's doing is it sending out

1037
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,255
A particular pattern

1038
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,071
The flight into the environment and then there's a camera

1039
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,607
That's looking at that pattern

1040
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,423
Typically that turns an infrared so human eyes don't see it

1041
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,495
But this camera infrared so it seems that pattern

1042
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,031
Triangulate

1043
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,847
And so that is actually just like using

1044
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:40,991
Middle School trigonometry to say hey this piece of the pattern I see it at this pixel

1045
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,087
And I know that I sent it out of this part of the projector

1046
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,647
And so I can just like see where those two lines meet

1047
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,975
And that's how far away that point is

1048
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:55,071
And that's the technique that was used in the original Microsoft Kinect

1049
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,119
That was from a company called primesense

1050
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,399
Way back when

1051
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,191
Connect cameras very good

1052
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,239
I just sawed scanning dinosaur bones

1053
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,311
Yep that was maybe the

1054
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:09,151
What was one of the first Billy successful uses of Guthrie Center

1055
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:15,039
And maybe the first year particularly notable example was in self-driving car aspect back in the DARPA challenge

1056
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,087
So that's where the other

1057
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:17,855
That last

1058
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:21,183
3D sensing I mentioned really comes into the Laser Rangefinder

1059
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,511
Where they're sending out individual collimated

1060
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Lazarbeam

1061
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,815
Out into the environment

1062
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351
And indirectly measuring

1063
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,143
How many nanoseconds have passed

1064
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,679
Before that that beam of light

1065
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
Comes back

1066
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:37,823
Anatomically do that with approximately no 64 or 32 beams all at the same time

1067
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,127
Laser rangefinders lidar systems

1068
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
They have the longest range

1069
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,943
By a wide margin

1070
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,271
And they're really really good for outdoor use

1071
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,831
Really really good for for self-driving cars

1072
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,599
In particular

1073
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
Ton of money

1074
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,415
They are very expensive

1075
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,207
AR

1076
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,743
Stella moving parts

1077
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:06,495
I didn't like those mechanical parts

1078
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,287
Those are police

1079
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,847
Is not very good

1080
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,615
Fortnite

1081
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,151
What exactly why we don't use it

1082
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,687
Where's the time of flight camera

1083
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
Is really great for night vision

1084
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,015
That is very good on the cost

1085
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,831
Cytosine substantially better than lidar systems

1086
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111
Is a little less good

1087
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,647
For something like

1088
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,439
Simultaneous localization and mapping

1089
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,631
Backup

1090
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,191
Simultaneous something something in math

1091
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,471
Location of mapping

1092
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,775
Is that just knowing where I am now showing up on a

1093
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,079
That is building a map

1094
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,127
And knowing where you are at the same time

1095
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,919
I'm terrible at that as a person

1096
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,199
Okay so

1097
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,759
China flight centers are also bad at that

1098
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:53,599
Good that's bad at it per say they're just a little bit less good

1099
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,879
Because they tend to be

1100
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
Slightly less

1101
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:01,023
Metrically accurate the exact distances that they measure or a little bit less good

1102
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,351
Then something like a structured light system or or laser range

1103
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,935
For the kind of application Lighthouse uses it for its purpose

1104
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:12,543
Because now it gives us great night vision gives us a really good cost performance

1105
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:17,919
And we're not actually moving around in the environment trying to build up a map where sitting stationary

1106
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:22,015
In the corner of your room trying to understand is that your kid is that your dog what it what is happening

1107
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,575
Got it so I won't put it on a Roomba

1108
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:28,159
Exactly exciting possible

1109
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
News

1110
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
USA Auto

1111
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,559
Caveat the heck out of this then the next generation iPhone

1112
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,119
Have 3D

1113
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,935
Sensing and it to recognize people's faces as part of their

1114
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
Your password

1115
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,751
So since you're an expert on

1116
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,519
3D sensing

1117
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,055
I figured I'd ask you about that

1118
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
Like I said

1119
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,615
Decent use case what

1120
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,663
That's in a battery powered device

1121
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,711
I feel like there's a lot of constraints

1122
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,247
Possibilities here what do you think

1123
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,295
Totally

1124
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,343
Answer for my battery point of view

1125
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,951
That's totally fine because they're only running it once in a rare while when you go to unlock

1126
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,231
You're screening rightly

1127
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
Now you're basically

1128
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:10,143
Obviously had no like actual inside information about what's happening there in like I'm only speculating here but like if I were using it

1129
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,423
I would only be like

1130
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,239
Running at that Center once in a while

1131
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,287
Battery usage point of view

1132
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,311
Not that big a deal

1133
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:23,711
Probably only run that when the accelerometer says Hey the phone is moving like somebody just pick me up

1134
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:28,319
Okay run the three sensor once every seconds or something rather than 30 frames

1135
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,367
So I can actually

1136
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,903
Add some crazy knowledge to

1137
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,695
Cuz I

1138
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,743
Technology that Qualcomm is built

1139
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,023
It is a

1140
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:41,119
Tiny little sensor on a chip that's basically can Detective

1141
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
Face

1142
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,447
What's computer vision Auto module

1143
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,263
Did Reds it sub to milliwatts

1144
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:51,359
Power so. Is low power consumption in all it's going to do is

1145
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,127
Hey

1146
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,919
A person is looking directly at me

1147
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,711
And then it's going to say

1148
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,247
Wake up good sensor

1149
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,527
Now measure the face

1150
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,623
So perfect

1151
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
The right thing to do

1152
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:08,511
If you were to hold a printed out

1153
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
No paper like

1154
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:14,143
Somebody's face you have a picture of it you held it in front of the camera like that one would say hey I see a face

1155
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,935
Nf3 sensor turns on

1156
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,751
Edit measures it and it says this looks awfully slaps

1157
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,287
I think I will not unlock this

1158
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,567
Yes

1159
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,359
Very cool

1160
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
Okay

1161
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,407
So in this case

1162
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,455
It's not waking up very long so we

1163
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,479
Worry less about battery

1164
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,527
It is tracking

1165
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,343
Presumably we all have different depths

1166
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,391
From our nose and

1167
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,671
Is that what

1168
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,439
It's measuring

1169
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,231
It would also be measuring that

1170
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,559
Very likely and at that range you would probably get

1171
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:46,655
Depending on the details of their sensor you would probably get pretty good structural information

1172
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,935
About that person's face

1173
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:54,591
And I know you could use like nice that wanted to work with my sunglasses are on and I kind of things they like you wouldn't be able to use ever

1174
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,639
Everything about it you're different hairstyles

1175
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
Could using their

1176
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,711
But you could certainly look at like

1177
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,319
Yeah what is the distance of like the tip of the nose to like the tip of the chin there's something like that

1178
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,599
That kind of technique

1179
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:10,719
An analog about technique has been used in pure computer vision likes color cameras only actually for sometime

1180
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,743
Is very effective

1181
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,327
And I would imagine that kind of thing in 3D sensing would also be very attacked

1182
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,399
Oh my gosh this is so funny so what if I like

1183
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,447
Because I v i broken my nose

1184
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,519
So then I'm like I would have stopped working if I have a plaster on my nose

1185
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:28,127
That you'll just have to try to find out

1186
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,687
Or plastic surgery I would have to retrain it

1187
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,783
Can you imagine lights

1188
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,391
Alex you have taught me a lot I love I love

1189
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
Loved

1190
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,951
Having you on the show so thank you so much

1191
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,023
Hey thanks for having me as has been released on

1192
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:51,935
That's it for this week's show thank you so much for listening and if you want more iot news
