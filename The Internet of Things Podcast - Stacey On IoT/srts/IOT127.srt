00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,152
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,736
And we have today

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:25,600
Zuv speaker and assistant news that we're going to cover including it

6
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,440
Amazon Echo multi-room audio in Google Assistant coming to

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
Josh

8
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,536
So we're going to discover GE trying to fix it

9
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,584
Predix Industrial iot

10
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:36,864
And

11
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:40,448
We build a special project just for our listeners

12
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,472
You're going to love it

13
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,800
We've also got a message from this week's brand new sponsor for truck

14
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
And

15
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
Our Guest

16
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,128
This week Alastair Allen

17
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,920
Who is a geek reimagining

18
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,248
How to secure the Internet of Things by having devices

19
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,528
Lie to each other

20
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,320
Going to be exciting

21
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:00,672
And before we get into all of that let's have a quick message from another one of our sponsors

22
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:07,072
This week sponsor is Lively did you know that on average it takes companies 18 months to launch and iot

23
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
Connected products

24
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:14,240
But it doesn't have to get your products into the hands of your customers faster with side li-po from concept 2

25
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,592
Connected in 4 months or less and get everything you need to run your connected product

26
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
Lively offers everything needed to get up and running including Hardware Integrations a lunch ready mobile app

27
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,272
Systems to manage

28
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:32,672
User and device data and pre-built Integrations with tools like Salesforce visit Zylie.

29
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,256
That s i v e l y

30
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,816
. com for more information

31
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,632
Okay Kevin

32
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,728
So much news let's get started first with GE and it's predict stuff

33
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
Because

34
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,800
In the billions of dollar category I feel like this

35
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
This is the biggest item we've got

36
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
So what happened it is

37
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,432
Rare's discovered that GE

38
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Has

39
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
Shifted its

40
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
Focus on the

41
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,832
Industrial internet-of-things because

42
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,648
It was crazy spending on its predix platform

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,696
And accountability

44
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
So

45
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,072
In Spring GE called a two-month timeout to tackle these

46
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
And now they're focusing

47
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,680
Only on a few Industries as

48
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
As opposed to

49
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
Iot

50
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,800
Opportunity so now they're going to only emphasize

51
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,616
Sales to existing customers in energy

52
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
Aviation

53
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
And oil and gas

54
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
Is this make sense

55
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Because

56
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
I actually

57
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
Talk to a company that is

58
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Competing with

59
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
Critics it's called flutura

60
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
And they were

61
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,328
Napping customers because a lot of customers who had Industrial Equipment data didn't want to give their

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,144
Proprietary data about how some of their Machinery work

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
Route to Geb

64
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Because GE my

65
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,800
So there's that issue so people worried about GE trying

66
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:57,664
Compete with them which makes sense then that she's got only try to serve its existing customers that are already buying their

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Equipment potoo

68
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
It also kind of emphasizes

69
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,576
How in the wild wild west of the Industrial internet-of-things

70
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
GE wanted to be

71
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,024
All things to everyone it wanted to be an IT player it wanted to be a traditional industrial Powerhouse and then it also

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
202 develop the algorithms needed to like do

73
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,144
It wanted to be IBM

74
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Yes

75
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:24,032
It's not easy to do that and basically what happened is G Building Stone clouds and last year it said

76
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,408
You know what our own cloud that's not a win for us we're going to work on Azure and AWS beak

77
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
Does that make sense

78
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,504
And what it seems to be now is

79
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,856
They're like okay we're also only going to work in certain industries

80
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,208
Not only where we have customers but also we have our expertise because

81
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48,608
Frank Leo I don't think we figured out how to scale in industrial iot platform I don't think there's one platform

82
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
That's going to work across all Industries

83
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:56,288
I would agree I would agree there's there's too many individual requirements for different types of Industries so

84
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
By focusing on these three core

85
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,224
Verticals it makes sense for GE to you know cuz I can focus on growing the customer base that they already have

86
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,296
We're not competing with those Industries so it makes sense

87
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
And

88
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
Huge Industries

89
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
It's going to be

90
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:17,280
That's kind of the GE story I think we're going to see we're already seeing it like samsara which is an industrial

91
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
Iot startup

92
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
It's doing very well

93
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,239
They wanted to do the same thing they wanted to build out this massive industrial iot platform and what happened was there like

94
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,823
It's pretty hard to do Fleet Management and cold

95
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Supply chain

96
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Because

97
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,407
Doing everything

98
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
Is it really pause

99
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,783
And I still talk to companies who are like hey you know what we're going to build the first scalable

100
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
But

101
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
I don't know if it's good luck with that

102
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,511
I want to hear about it if you think you've done it

103
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,863
So that's our industrial iot this is pretty big because

104
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,143
As part of this

105
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,959
GE is also expecting

106
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,823
12 billion in digital Revenue in 2020 and that includes its products stuff

107
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
That's compared to

108
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
15 billion

109
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
Previously talked about

110
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,223
I remember getting that prediction for them

111
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,503
A while back

112
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,527
How much years ago

113
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
That's amazing

114
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,879
But apparently it was a little too amazing

115
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
So

116
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
But they're not backing off

117
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
They're just

118
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,535
Refocusing perhaps

119
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
A little bit more

120
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Where we are today

121
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
All right

122
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,423
Moving along to

123
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
Crazy

124
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Smart Home

125
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,799
News before we move on

126
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
I have to tell you guy

127
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
Little Harvey update

128
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,687
Hurricane Harvey strike Houston which is where I grew up

129
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:44,831
Add lots of friends and family there everybody I know is safe some of them have lost things that are precious to them

130
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,623
But everyone is safe

131
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
And

132
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,231
I am safe and for all of you guys who've been sending me nice messages

133
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
Thank you

134
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
And

135
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,327
I'll let you know next week after

136
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
Still ongoing as of now so

137
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,959
I don't know what to say right now

138
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
And can appreciate the help

139
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
And good thoughts

140
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
People are sending

141
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:12,223
That's good to hear on your side there still so many people that will be affected and that's it just tragic to watch quite honestly

142
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
Going to be insane

143
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
So

144
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Okay

145
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
Oh I also have a

146
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
Correction

147
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,927
Right here in the middle of the show I have a correction

148
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,511
Two episodes ago we talked about the super sensor

149
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
This is a

150
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
Sensor that was developed to

151
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,959
Analyze sound and other information from the house and

152
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,775
Basically say oh hey you turn on the faucet in the kitchen

153
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Or hey

154
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
That's your bathroom shower

155
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
Which we all thought was

156
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,383
School it is

157
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
I said it was from

158
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
But it is not

159
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
It is from Kearney

160
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
I know

161
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Idaho

162
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
My apologies

163
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,975
MIT you do some very cool stuff Carnegie Mellon

164
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
So do you you also do really

165
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
Lake. In this case

166
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
You guys

167
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Developed

168
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
So

169
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Noted

170
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,031
I did send the link to the right place so if you ended up there from checking it out

171
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Probably realized my mistake

172
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
Okay

173
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
Yeah we live on

174
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
I want to

175
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Digital

176
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Assistance

177
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Dash

178
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
Should we start with

179
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,831
Multi-room audio from the Amazon Echo

180
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,695
We can do that that's that's something that you've been looking forward to and it's it snow here

181
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
It is

182
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,279
It's a little bit more difficult than I thought it would be

183
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,935
It's challenging it's it's also very a little bit limiting it's not on every Echo device yet so my tab

184
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,007
Sitting in the corner like it's being punished because it is not supported but

185
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,615
Echo dots and the original Echo and Echo Show devices all support

186
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Multi-room audio

187
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
3rd party

188
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,671
Indeed indeed job you can also you can use this to play songs in different rooms from Amazon

189
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
TuneIn iHeartRadio Pandora

190
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,583
Not yet for Spotify with you Stacy listen to end SiriusXM which

191
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,863
I listen to you too so

192
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
Unfortunately what kind of

193
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
On hold for that

194
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,751
Securus a pro tips that Kevin and I have

195
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
I figured out

196
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Trial

197
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,383
Which is going to hell you have to figure out a lot of your Amazon Echo

198
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
Not great

199
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
So

200
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
First

201
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,879
If your Spotify or Sirius XM is your default

202
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:32,767
You probably if you really want to get into this you're going to want to change your default to like Amazon

203
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,655
Or Pandora One of the services that works because your other alternative is to say something like play

204
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,983
Beyonce on Amazon music in this room

205
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
Which is kind of a lot

206
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
2

207
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
Let's talk about room names

208
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,711
Sopac when Amazon introduced calling and drop in

209
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,759
I actually changed the names of all of my

210
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
Echoes two things like

211
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,831
Master bedroom or

212
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Color Kim

213
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
My daughter's name

214
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
Her name is not Kim

215
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,511
So what I would do it.

216
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
And the echo in a room

217
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Woodwork

218
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
It was awesome

219
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
But when I tried to say

220
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,143
Play Beyonce on

221
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
The echo was like

222
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Nope

223
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
So I actually have a change it to

224
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
To Kim's room

225
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
It seems to have to be location

226
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
Based from a context and point

227
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,687
Which was a little weird for me and I had a

228
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
Dot that I hit

229
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
Creatively named Dottie

230
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,599
And I actually ended up having to change that

231
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
2

232
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Living room

233
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
Because it would not play

234
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
In Dottie it would not play in Daddy's room

235
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,559
It would not play on Dottie and it would not play on Daddy's room

236
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:44,959
So it's kind of a strange way of doing it and also when you do this you have to set up

237
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,495
Groups of speakers

238
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,127
And a little challenging if I don't where you actually do that I think we found two different places and they have to do that right

239
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
Yes

240
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
I did it in the smart home sec

241
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
Where are you at Creative Group

242
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,551
Or maybe you can grab some light bulbs for example by room

243
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,903
In there when you create a new group you have the option of what device group would you always had

244
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,279
You now have a multi-room music group option and that's where you set up or what I wear I setup my

245
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
My multiple speaker

246
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Groups

247
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,631
And if you go under settings

248
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
You can scroll under all your devices

249
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,031
Two groups and if you click on multi-room music

250
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
You can pick

251
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Your

252
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
Multi-room music so you can take create group there

253
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,687
You can only put a device

254
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
Into a single group

255
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,783
See you downstairs and upstairs

256
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,855
And you have all your downstairs ones in it

257
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,927
If you do that then you can't have one called everywhere that includes

258
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
All of them

259
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Right

260
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
So it's a little limited there

261
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
Java group you have to have more than one device

262
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
We actually trying to

263
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,935
Get around to the weird naming by creating a group called the proper name

264
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
But that did not

265
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
It does not work

266
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Car Bluetooth streaming

267
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,103
So if you're streaming something

268
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
From your phone

269
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
It's not going to play

270
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
In Minneapolis

271
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,783
Strictly that the streaming directly through

272
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
Amazon were connected services

273
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
I'm kind of bummed about the tapping

274
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
Supported right now because

275
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,231
It's always like the one that gets featured the last

276
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,583
And I get that it's maybe not always plugged in for people but come on they did it with the

277
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
I'm always listening option A later added that

278
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,239
It also gives the option that included in a multi-room audio group

279
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
That's why I don't like that

280
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:30,943
No I take my tap out on the tech I take it you in different rooms that don't have an account for every room

281
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
In fact

282
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,295
Because of some news when I talk about the minute I may not buy anymore Equus at all

283
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
Yes

284
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
In fact I will you

285
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
Use my Sonos on the routes because

286
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,535
Sonos is set to announce its multi-room audio at features or a speaker rather

287
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,119
With a microphone is smart speakers smart speakers

288
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,703
On October 5th so we will let you know how that goes

289
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,775
Related to that

290
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,359
I don't know if you caught this in the Amazon press release on multi-room audio

291
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:05,503
Amazon has added an SDK for multi-room music and it connected speaker API

292
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,551
And guess who they got a quote from

293
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,159
The VP of software at Sonos

294
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Yeah

295
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
Disconnect

296
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
Yeah

297
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
Scrappy dappy Doo

298
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,287
Ambidextrous of working with Bose sound United and Samsung so

299
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:33,919
Tell me interesting to see by the end of the year I suspect we'll see lots of Amazon Echo

300
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
Voice service speakers

301
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Excellent but

302
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
What are you don't really love

303
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Madam

304
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
What's

305
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
Here it is

306
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
Which is the giant Appliance in

307
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
Consumer

308
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Home show

309
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
In Germany

310
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
I wish you were there

311
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
Google Assistant

312
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
Said it would work with

313
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
LG

314
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
And other things right.

315
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,127
Yeah since you returned my speakers I'll go through this first Google Assistant will be coming soon to

316
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,687
Zillow

317
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,271
Best speaker the take-home mini by mob boy

318
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,831
And the ga10 speaker by Panasonic

319
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,903
So there will be more speakers coming but

320
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
You will have

321
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,231
Google assistant at least it was three speakers soon

322
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,815
I believe it's by the end of the year that's coming out later this year

323
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,655
Most of it up on the US UK Australia Canada Germany and France

324
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,983
More interesting to me is

325
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,311
LG appliances are getting

326
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,847
Google Assistant

327
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,895
And my appliances I just don't mean like

328
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
Fridge I mean washer

329
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,247
Dryer's vacuums and more

330
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,111
And we didn't realize this at least I didn't before the show started looking around and LG I didn't know

331
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,183
Makes a series of Roomba like

332
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,255
Vacuums they call it the humba twice

333
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,607
Not called the homebodies probably Stacy said to me before they probably already is a home.

334
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,447
But these are from 679 to $999

335
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
Robotic vacuums

336
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,543
With cameras and security features and so on

337
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,639
It would not surprise me if these get Google Assistant later this year

338
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
All right

339
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
Should we call this amount of Zurich

340
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Cortana news

341
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Yes

342
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,927
Call it yes cuz it's both

343
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Yes

344
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
Microsoft Cortana

345
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,535
That is going to talk to Madam a

346
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Is can I talk to

347
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
And

348
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
I don't have a Windows

349
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,703
Machine anywhere that use Cortana Kevin

350
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,567
I still do I still have one or two slider on Asia

351
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
Has very good it's just I

352
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
I just don't use those machines that much

353
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,711
Yes you can say

354
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
Madam a

355
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Open

356
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Windows 10

357
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,135
Deceive it's a little clunky how it's going to work

358
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
Microsoft says you'll just say

359
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,487
Hey Cortana open matinee

360
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,071
And then you can ask matabei to order something for example

361
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,887
And vice-versa can say hey madhumeh open Cortana

362
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
And

363
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
Maybe get your

364
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Office

365
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
365

366
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,311
Next calendar event or something like that Amanda thinking I would do that but

367
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,127
Just as an example there's a little bit of clunkiness here

368
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
Internity interface

369
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
I think that's

370
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,247
Partly because voice is still so

371
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Unusual

372
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:22,111
Relatively new and these kind of Partnerships and figuring out

373
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,927
How to position your brand

374
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
In voice command cuz that's

375
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
Part of the challenge

376
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,279
Right here like

377
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:35,679
This is probably a win for both companies but in my opinion is more of a win from Microsoft

378
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
Because

379
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:42,335
Originally Cortana came out on Windows phones and those are no more.

380
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,383
Product line is essentially dead

381
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,783
So yes Microsoft Cortana into the newer operating systems Windows 10 and so on so forth

382
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
Good

383
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,855
But it hasn't found a growing

384
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,695
Market to add Cortana to expand its base because PC

385
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,487
Market is not growing

386
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
Phones are growing but they don't have any

387
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
What is growing

388
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,839
Digital assistants

389
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,911
So now they've got their AI into

390
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,727
I don't know I'm going to guess tens of millions of

391
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,007
Amazon echos

392
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
This could be very interesting

393
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:18,175
Sing in the Enterprise space so if you guys are I would love to hear from people who are working in offices

394
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
What this means for you

395
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,271
You guys because I think that's where this could get

396
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:27,903
Interesting although a lot of people are building and putting Amazon Echo into offices I think there's

397
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,487
Real advantages to having some of the security and admin

398
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,047
Elements that Microsoft

399
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,911
I would agree with that and I go a step further and say this is Microsoft's

400
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,983
First real step into the Smart Home Market

401
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
Because

402
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:47,103
What can you do with Cortana from a Spartan perspective right now probably not much I don't think

403
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
Feeling it too

404
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
The echo you can then

405
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
Voice control that stuff

406
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,271
No I have been hearing rumors that Microsoft is going to announce something

407
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Really big

408
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
Andy's Market Market

409
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,879
Would not surprise me

410
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
Actually it is a little

411
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:07,583
It is a little surprising because if I look at where Microsoft is not just traditionally been power

412
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
Powerful that where it's reaching and pushing

413
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
IT services

414
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
With azure

415
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
It is

416
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
Definitely pushing more

417
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
Enterprise Industrial

418
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
Data analytics

419
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,407
So it is a little odd to me that it would be like a getaway

420
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
Let's let's go back to the store

421
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
That just seems bizarre to me

422
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:32,671
But they've had two versions slimdown version of Windows to run on arm processors and Raspberry Pi

423
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
Pies and so on so they haven't

424
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:38,815
Totally overlooked this area but I would agree that Focus has been warned Enterprise

425
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
Asher is doing a great job

426
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
So

427
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,727
Smart speaker news story for us we have a new smart speaker

428
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Slayer

429
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,287
This is a startup called

430
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,359
J-Stars company's name the product is Josh

431
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
Dot AI

432
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,943
And it is

433
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
Josh

434
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Micro

435
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Is this

436
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,087
Particular product so Josh has been around for a while

437
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
Doing

438
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,439
Professional installs and voice activation associate

439
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,535
Professional installers so you could have called like your CDA guy

440
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,607
Install basically a computer running Josh that

441
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
Control

442
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,191
Your control for your

443
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,007
Lutrinae or whatever else is installed in the

444
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,079
What this is it CD of this year

445
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
They're going to be showing off

446
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,663
In launching

447
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,247
Echo like device it actually looks would you say it look like Kevin

448
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,831
I said it looks like an upside-down bowl with the top cut off

449
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
Yeah

450
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,671
It reminded me of the eufy genie

451
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
We don't know how much it's going to cost

452
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,607
This is Wi-Fi the cool things that this has

453
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Sitar

454
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
Worth thinking about

455
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
Is the top of it

456
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Top of the

457
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
Which I guess would be the bottom of the bowl but

458
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
It's facing.

459
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
Top since it's upside down

460
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:58,687
That part has a motion sensor light sensors temperature sensors Etc

461
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:02,783
So you can do things that knows when you're in the room so you can do things like

462
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,367
Josh turn on the lights and it will actually turn on the lights of the room that

463
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,255
Has memory so it can retain the conversation

464
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Been having

465
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,071
I don't know how long

466
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,119
But you know if you say turn on the lights

467
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,983
It'll turn the lights on and then if you say dim lights to 50% it'll be like

468
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,775
Yeah there's a light that just turned out I bet

469
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,335
So that's cool and then it also accepts

470
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,615
Multiple commands at 1

471
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
Which

472
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Yes please

473
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,295
So I think this is really interesting without pricing

474
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,879
I'm going to see it when I'm at CDO by the way you guys I'll be

475
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
Next week

476
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,231
And we will have a special CD podcasts

477
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
Will get a double bonus

478
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
That's forever

479
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
I know you're cheering right now

480
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
That's only speaker

481
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,471
We got some Home Care

482
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,823
I think that's what we do as homekit devices again all this news coming out of

483
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,871
Dife orifa show

484
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,455
Elgato has some new homekit devices

485
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:09,087
I want is actually a refresh of an existing devices really for new devices

486
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:15,487
The eve Thermo is there connected radiator valves the way that's a second-generation so that way you can control your

487
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,327
He threw the scheduling and someone's got the password touch control

488
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,607
What temperature display

489
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,959
Bridgeless architecture and mornstar shipping on September 26

490
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,311
And then the new products are the eaves smoke smoke detector

491
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:34,175
The eve window guard the evelock which is done conjunction with Yale

492
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,247
And the eve Aqua connected irrigation controller

493
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
So these are all

494
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:45,183
Products that you would expect to see for the smartphone market not like anything at totally outrageously new but again these are all home kits

495
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,975
Supported so that is a big deal for them

496
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,023
It is end

497
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,583
I didn't love their original motion

498
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
Which I had tried

499
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,679
It wasn't very fast it didn't

500
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
It was big

501
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
Didn't love it from the sensor perspective

502
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,543
But things like

503
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
New lock

504
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,871
That's actually pretty exciting

505
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
870 euros

506
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Roughly 60

507
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,783
So that's the homekit news out there's also a homekit light bulbs

508
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
How-to geek

509
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,111
It's most colors

510
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,720
It looks like a candelabra bulb but it's actually like a regular size bulb so it's

511
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
Rather large

512
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
Unwieldy

513
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:27,680
Sylvania smart a19 light bulb that is shaped like

514
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
Looking for normal light

515
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,008
Homekit enabled does not require a hub

516
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,312
And that actually works really well the colors are

517
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,848
Rich it works

518
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,736
Motion detector in homekit I've programmed that light to come on

519
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Quickly

520
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Pleasantly

521
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:46,112
I've run to the colors they are bright they're not as bright as rich as the

522
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,720
Second gen Hue richer colors if you guys are taking notes on that but they

523
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,000
Did you look lovely

524
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,536
Book lovely

525
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,072
How much is that bulb

526
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
45

527
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:02,496
45 peso this one is also how does homekit supported and it's 36 so it's even

528
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:07,616
It looks a little like I said unwieldy if you have it under a shade or something you wouldn't really see it then

529
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,432
It displays more than 16 million colors which is nice

530
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,784
All right and we're going to take a listener question

531
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,088
So our question this week is from

532
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
North Yarmouth

533
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
Name

534
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,208
And mr. young asking us about

535
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
SmartThings

536
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
He writes

537
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,424
Thank you for bringing me into the iot world I'm concerned about SmartThings not sticking around most everything is on sale now in

538
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
Including their newest hubs

539
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,776
Homes are being cleared out what is the successor

540
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,104
And this person really enjoys using SmartThings in two different properties

541
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
And there

542
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
Little sad about battery life

543
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,736
They would hate to see them

544
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
Well

545
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,576
We have an answer for you they're not leaving me

546
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,136
They were purchased by Samsung

547
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
A couple years ago

548
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,208
And what is happening is

549
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,352
I think it's part of this overall movement away from hubs because most normal mainstream consumers

550
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,632
I want to invest in a hub

551
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,752
So they'll still make those but Samsung is embedding SmartThings in smart TVs

552
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,544
And also into

553
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,104
It's Wi-Fi access point

554
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
Poinsettias make

555
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
So

556
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
That is

557
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
What is happening

558
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,528
SmartThings they are innovating they actually earlier this year

559
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,856
Did a major back-end redesigned which

560
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,464
But what it does is it gives it a lot more agility in

561
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,768
Inflexibility for building new services

562
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,816
And Kevin any thoughts from you

563
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:37,472
And it's certainly not going anywhere as you said they're going public yay I love that anywhere and everywhere that they can

564
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:43,872
Put SmartThings into devices appliances and so on they're going to continue doing so I would have no concern about smart things going anywhere

565
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,688
All right

566
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
You can keep your SmartThings stuff

567
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
And will

568
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
Yay

569
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
Kevin

570
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,440
You built us all a big surprise

571
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
Blisters

572
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
Everybody

573
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
Well

574
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:09,216
We build a voicemail system specifically for the iot podcast and while we could have done this

575
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:13,056
Just by using Google Voice or Skype voicemail

576
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,872
We decided to take it like a little iot project

577
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
So

578
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:23,040
I'm since we love getting your questions or comments and so on what we have is let me get the voicemail number out first and I'll explain what it is

579
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
Palace at 5 1/2

580
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,928
623-7424. Message

581
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
In your message

582
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,512
Let us know if it's okay to actually

583
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:37,632
Embed your question you're coming in the show if we don't have your permission we certainly will not do that

584
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,240
What we did is we have the response system running on a Raspberry Pi

585
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:47,872
A headless Raspberry Pi meaning there's no monitor keyboard or mouse attached currently

586
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,432
Set it up I did have to connect a monitor to it

587
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:56,576
We're using the standard the software that comes on Raspberry Pi and got some Python scripts

588
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,112
They're constantly running

589
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:03,744
We tied those into twilio and Stacy

590
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
Yeah

591
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:10,144
There you go I was couple years back so we decided let's try to really again

592
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,544
The apis are very easy to use there's a nice little console on dashboard that tells us when you called when there's a message

593
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,872
Play your message and record it and save it and all that

594
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:24,736
So basically this is just a little like a set of inexpensive Raspberry Pi running

595
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,016
Python scripts

596
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,320
With the chulio so if you call it

597
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,136
You can leave a message and we will actually

598
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:37,024
Get a text message that we know that you have left us a message and then we'll go take a listen

599
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,840
Ye all right so let's get that number again

600
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,656
Yep it is 512

601
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,192
6 to 3

602
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,216
7 4

603
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
2/4

604
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,592
Because it was a little iot project it might make sense for me to write this up

605
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:56,992
For the new Stacey on iot blog we can get into it more that details for people who want to know how to do this

606
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
So

607
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,320
We're also going to put it on the website

608
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,368
Call the iot podcast listener hotline

609
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Woohoo

610
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
And I have an Android app

611
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,024
Actually if you search for The Internet of Things podcast on Android

612
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,816
I actually think it's Stacey on iot

613
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
On Android

614
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,632
You should be able to find it and download the app

615
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,168
If you're happy that way

616
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,496
And there is a link in there to call the show

617
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
So

618
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
Guys

619
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
Send us your question

620
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
Girls also send requests

621
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
I cannot wait

622
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
Kevin thank you so much for

623
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,784
Yeah it was fun

624
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,576
Yeah we look forward to your write-up

625
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
And now

626
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,672
Let's talk about having our devices

627
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:42,304
Lie to each other and how that might enhance security for The Internet of Things

628
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,352
Stay tuned for our guest

629
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
Alistair Allen

630
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
Up next

631
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:53,056
On the Internet of Things podcast we're breaking into the Internet of Things podcast with the message from

632
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,128
Our sponsor sponsor is Fort Rock

633
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:00,736
And I have Robert Humphrey the CMO of four truck here to talk to me

634
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
So Robert

635
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,576
Fort Rock is a digital identity management

636
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:08,672
Why does Fort rocks platform matter for the internet

637
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,000
And what digital identity does it help

638
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:18,656
Companies monetize customer relationships as well as dress regulations that are filled front and center and everybody's

639
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,936
Mine our own privacy

640
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,216
Sense things like

641
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,520
European Union's gdpr

642
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:29,920
HIPAA regulations here in the US FCC privacy regulations Etc digital identity

643
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
Alias the enabler in the

644
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:37,856
Center of all of that digital identity initially it kind of its Inception was all about employee

645
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,440
Identity in grew into customer identity

646
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,000
And now in our differentiation

647
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,304
And where we were founded was all about

648
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
Identity of people devices

649
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
The difference

650
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,192
Between employee ID

651
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,472
Customer identity

652
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
Growing into

653
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,824
Peyote is the issue of scale

654
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,408
Employee identity is limited to the number employee somebody has

655
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,456
100000 is a lot of employee

656
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
Customer identity

657
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,784
Is limited to the number of them

658
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,088
Customer somebody has so it's in the Millions

659
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:13,696
Iot identity in the identity of things is

660
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,768
Almost unlimited but clearly it's in the billions

661
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,072
And billions identity and that

662
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
Is why it's important to iot

663
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,912
And that's one of my biggest differentiators

664
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,032
And how do you guys help your customers improve their businesses using

665
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
Digital identity

666
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:35,456
Start with one that people probably haven't heard of a company called Amer Sports Hammer is the owner of Wilson Sporting Goods

667
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:39,296
Salomon skis Atomic skis Precor exercise equipment

668
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
Except

669
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
And like a lot of companies

670
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,672
Didn't know who their customers are

671
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,256
Didn't have a relationship with the customers because of the nature of their products

672
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,048
Has done

673
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,072
Is

674
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,376
Using iot is now

675
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:59,776
Put sensors into many of their products or today you can walk into a sporting good store or buy from Amazon

676
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,312
Wilson X basketball

677
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:07,712
Has a sensor in it that allows you then to do really cool things with a basketball now I can play horse with somebody

678
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
In another country

679
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,528
Let the ball is telling me

680
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,808
Where to shoot from

681
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,600
Excedrin is tracking all that stuff

682
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
Interesting from a

683
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,720
Amber perspective is they now because they're connecting

684
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
The customer

685
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
Good at basketball

686
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,376
They know who their customers are and they're able to them cross cell in Excel

687
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,960
Basketball football soccer Balls Etc

688
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,264
Because they know their customers much better

689
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,336
Doing two things from the Amber perspective there knowing the customer

690
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,896
Unable to do all sorts of interesting things

691
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,968
From a customer's perspective

692
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:43,040
They're building more in interesting engagement

693
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
Approaches

694
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:48,160
Because of what they can do they can extend that Plainfield for the sporting equipment

695
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,488
Across borders across continents countries Etc

696
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,024
By connecting those ball

697
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
Awesome

698
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,096
Alright Robert where can I go

699
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,120
To find out more

700
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,192
Go to www.ford.com

701
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:14,272
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

702
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,624
He's Alistair Alan who is a former academic

703
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
2 hacks make

704
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
6 and rights thing

705
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
About the internet

706
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,024
So how is your welcome thank you

707
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
Great to be here thanks I haven't

708
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
I am really excited

709
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,912
First because you're British and you're going to sound smarter

710
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
All of my other

711
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
Even if you're not

712
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
But

713
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,568
You actually are pretty smart so let's get started

714
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
Briefly

715
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:44,992
You have put forth some ideas about how we should secure the internet of things and how we're thinking about the way we

716
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,528
We design Hardware kind of wrong

717
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,088
Can you describe this as like a few sentences

718
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,368
Sure so

719
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:56,512
Recently I've come across some cases of what I'm calling maldita malicious dates are being injected into

720
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,352
Internet of Things sensor systems distributed sensor systems

721
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,400
And that serve kicked off a line of thought

722
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
Tell me about

723
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
How we're designing

724
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
The architectures

725
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,288
Things itself in about how

726
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,104
Those architectures affect the security

727
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,872
Fun fact

728
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,200
The the Felicity of the dates are going around those systems

729
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,272
And just didn't like it before I bite smart devices

730
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
Essentially

731
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
These days

732
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,856
Hardware is just software Raptor

733
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
Symplastic

734
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
An idea I think has done

735
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,440
Real harm

736
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
To the way with design

737
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
Devices

738
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:32,096
Let's break that down because what does it mean when you're talking about

739
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,632
Hardware just being software

740
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,680
Does that mean we're ignoring

741
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,216
Security on the hardware side

742
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:41,568
What's happened is that we've inherited in architecture from our software

743
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,872
System so when you

744
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,456
Ask a device to do something you'd say turn on or turn off

745
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,760
You're essentially just telling the device

746
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,832
Effectively the API the devices

747
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
Presenting to the world

748
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,136
Is just

749
00:31:55,392 --> 00:32:00,256
The software on donut are delaying it so essentially your calling a software subroutine to do something

750
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
On the device

751
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Which means

752
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
That

753
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,120
Very much is a command-and-control arkit

754
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,936
All the devices are presenting

755
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,264
Direct access to the physical things they do

756
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,824
So a light switch or a light bulb

757
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,104
Turn on or off

758
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,152
A sensor can be

759
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,200
You can get the value of the sensor

760
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,528
And I think that actually quite harmful architect

761
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,600
Patrick is sure as a person I should be able to tell my

762
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
Light bulbs

763
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
Turn on and off

764
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:33,024
But increasingly are smart devices are controlled by well other smart devices

765
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,840
So why should another smart device have the

766
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,120
Control over my thing

767
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
Did I do

768
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
So what I've been thinking about

769
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
Is

770
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,520
Howell devices should talk to one another Rob

771
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,152
Okay and that that makes sense because ideally we're building something that's scalable

772
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,688
It doesn't require me

773
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,224
To sit in the middle of

774
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,040
Tell everything in the world around me to do anything

775
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:59,136
So your idea here is that you will program things to lie to each

776
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,672
So how would that work

777
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:05,792
What are the problems with the Internet of Things always the consumer side of the internet of things right now is

778
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
That

779
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:11,168
Pretty much all of the systems that are commercially available assume that there is a human in the

780
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,496
That is part of the conversation with the device or the system

781
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,032
There is a human

782
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,336
Making decisions or at least monitor

783
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
Bring the system in some way

784
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,664
And I see said that isn't going to scale

785
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
What is this new way to scale that

786
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,528
It's it's if you look at your iPad right now I mean I have this problem

787
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
If you must have this

788
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,112
There must be 50 apps in your iPad right now to

789
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
Even more

790
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,720
Yeah okay I have a whole folder these

791
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,512
Exit it Scrolls page at

792
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,352
And 0 with we are outlined cases you and

793
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,400
We are not the typical consumer

794
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
It anyway

795
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
But the problem is

796
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
That's where the typical

797
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
Consumers going to be in

798
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
Time

799
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,592
So very obviously

800
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
We all know this

801
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
That's going to have to

802
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:57,760
But if you imagine the case in the future of say a smart heating system

803
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,600
And you can tell a smart heating system to turn off

804
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,136
Okay that's fine

805
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,184
Until Tim and Tina a temperature

806
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
Okay

807
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,024
But say you're in a kitchen

808
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,352
Your oven is smart on the oven

809
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,400
Should be able to tell a smart heating system

810
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
To turn off

811
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,496
Because it's turn the oven on in the heat

812
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,544
The kitchen's going to heat up because the oven

813
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:25,152
Or say the ovens turned off and it tells the heating system

814
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,176
How to turn back on again

815
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,224
At the same time the window is open

816
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
The windows smart

817
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,320
So the window tells the heating system

818
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:36,416
To do something else because obviously now you've got the kitchen is open to the outside in

819
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,696
I need to waste money

820
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,976
Heating outside

821
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
Or

822
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,608
You have a son sensor to tell you how much I liked is coming through the window and it

823
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,632
It's the middle of the day

824
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:52,544
Once the system is told you to turn the heating on in one system tells it to tell the heating

825
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
To turn off

826
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,384
What does the heating system listen to

827
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,944
Well in this is something I as an individual

828
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
Most of us will not work

829
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,320
I don't want to be it's hard enough that I have to set priorities in my

830
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,344
Is my internet

831
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,928
Skype calls prioritize this

832
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,976
So I can imagine saying

833
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,512
Hey listen to my window sensor

834
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,792
HVAC or

835
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,096
Oh no no listen to my ceiling fan

836
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
So you're

837
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
Solution

838
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,704
Your thought here is

839
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,032
The solution is that it shouldn't listen to any of

840
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:30,176
They should be able to talk to it and it should be able to talk to them but they shouldn't take commands from other objects

841
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:35,296
Why should my smart window are my Smart Oven be able to tell my heating system

842
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,832
Demand for my heat

843
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
System

844
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,880
Did it turn on the roll

845
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,952
They should be able to to provide information

846
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,232
Or request

847
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,048
Hey I turn on you might want to think about turning off

848
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,120
So all of this would then be mediated where

849
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
Because

850
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,960
The benefit of having a truly smart home is having these

851
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,728
Things have this kind

852
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
Conversation

853
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:59,872
Exactly the conversation is is exactly the right word right now what happens

854
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,688
Those apis are very specifically tied

855
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,224
To the function of the device

856
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
To turn on or off

857
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,040
Set this temperature

858
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:13,440
Imitated the architecture them separately currently playing with RR what a cold agent architecture is there they're actually truly

859
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
Smart device

860
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,488
And

861
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,536
What happens if you actually have negotiation

862
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
Ansel

863
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,608
The smartness if you like

864
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:25,984
Drop side of what's called emerging complexity did the negotiations between the various devices

865
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,264
So

866
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,336
Effectively there isn't one place where this is mediated

867
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,688
Eights mediated in the exchange of messages between all the devices

868
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,528
So what does that look like cuz I'm hearing you and I'm picturing

869
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
Some sort of

870
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,832
Butler inside my home

871
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,624
A computer that is

872
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,928
Tracking all this and making decisions

873
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,720
But that actually doesn't sound

874
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
Quite what you're

875
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:52,352
That's not exactly what I'm talking about that's that's only one architecture where

876
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,400
Where you have some sort of central point

877
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,936
Negotiation

878
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,240
Send failure what I'm talking about is more distributor

879
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
Intelligence

880
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,568
There was a case recently in California

881
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,360
Of a Vineyard

882
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,128
Square

883
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,432
Malicious data was fed into

884
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,504
Distributed water sensing system

885
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,040
So this was a system setup

886
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,088
To check the moisture in the soil

887
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,672
And automatically triggers some sprinklers if the moisture in various places

888
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
What's below us

889
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,512
Levelland militia States was fed into the system

890
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,608
And that automatically triggered the sprinklers in the the crop

891
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
Was massively overwatered

892
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
And farmer was fine

893
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,496
Quite a large amount by the state of California for

894
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,568
Too much water at 4 actually triggered this whole

895
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
Line of thought

896
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,384
List exactly what happened

897
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
It was one single

898
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,224
Piece of data that was One commands to go

899
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
Hey I have

900
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,784
Low-moisture reading here

901
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,808
Turn on the sprinkler

902
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,088
And

903
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,440
What was happening was he sprinklers was sitting in the middle of a large distributed sensor net

904
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,256
And it was one single Auburn

905
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,560
Piece of data that was saying turn on

906
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,328
Sprinklers

907
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,448
Why did that single piece of dates a trick of the sprinklers while because of the way the architectures work

908
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,264
It's like if you got this sensor reading

909
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
You should turn on

910
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
On the sprinklers

911
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,640
But I also have a history if there is a history

912
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
O2 sensor readings

913
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
Fine

914
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,992
It was the only piece of day so that was that was Auburn

915
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:13,760
It was

916
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,832
Why should that particular piece of Beto triggered

917
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856
The water

918
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
Shouldn't of done

919
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,440
So what should have happened was

920
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,720
If they should have looked

921
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,000
WhatsApp history

922
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,304
The sensor readings in Gone Wild

923
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,376
And then should go die and asked all the other sensors

924
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
Hey

925
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,472
What's going on is like do you have those Vizsla readings

926
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:38,080
Initiative intensive negotiation messaging should have happened and it should have been dead and gone

927
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,384
Well that's at Auburn piece of pizza

928
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
It's not

929
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:44,224
Something I should pay attention to I'm going to ignore that

930
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,760
Are the same thing

931
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,552
Should happen of a consumer level

932
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
In your home

933
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
So

934
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,672
If I'm thinking about building and architecture like this

935
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
Is there enough

936
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:57,536
Computing power on a sensor to actually handle this kind of

937
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:01,120
Pulling for certain data and then say what

938
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,936
How does this work within the systems we already have or do we

939
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
Rip and replace

940
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,520
Right so

941
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
That's a great question

942
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,824
Because you're right

943
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,104
You can't do it everywhere

944
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:17,760
So I guess the way I'm modeling it right now is is a series a tiers of Architecture is so the

945
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528
The lowest level

946
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,576
You effectively have sensors

947
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
That's

948
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
Just get out of there

949
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,208
Moisture there measuring temperature there measuring

950
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
Humidity

951
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
Whatever

952
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,560
There's no real need for them to

953
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:34,144
Have the sort of intelligence the result of a decision making

954
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,216
Because they have no actuators they're not going to affect the world

955
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,544
They can provide readings readings can be requested from them

956
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
But that's it

957
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,848
At the lowest level in the

958
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,896
The really power constrained devices

959
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,456
There's no real necessity to have

960
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,992
DeSoto decision-making

961
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,040
Ability that's necessary in this earth

962
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,880
The mid-tier where you're having

963
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
Devices that

964
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,720
Are have a single actuator

965
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
Yes is problems there

966
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,792
So your sprinkler

967
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
Yes it was sprinkler system

968
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,376
Is this the real

969
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,912
Necessity to have

970
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,448
High end computing

971
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
It just turn the valve on

972
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,336
Why would you have a high in

973
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,640
There I don't have a quite

974
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,200
As I said these are

975
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,736
Ideas and playing with

976
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,552
They're not solidified yet and yeah that's

977
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
That is definitely

978
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,904
You could see it being mediated by

979
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:34,560
Higher-end devices that have the capability to do this sort of reasoning

980
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,608
Dedicated Gateway or is it going to be like

981
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
Oh heck I have

982
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,680
Extra compute power right

983
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
Where so I'm just going

984
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
Can use that

985
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,264
My turn ID with the latter

986
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
That you have

987
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
Computed nodes

988
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,664
Distributed so for instance warning things you seeing is

989
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,688
Gateway devices

990
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
Between sensors

991
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
Right so

992
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:57,856
You have zigbee systems Gateway into IP systems you have

993
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,160
Ble systems Gateway tint eyepieces

994
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:00,928
Shenzhen

995
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,000
Vice versa so this pretty much always

996
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,024
Extra computer

997
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,304
Available at those Gateway

998
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,608
That could be used for this sort of stuff

999
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
And you also have

1000
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
For instance

1001
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
YP

1002
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,728
Accessible Gateway

1003
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,752
TED talks to her

1004
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
Sick pieces

1005
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,800
Princess run

1006
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
Sprinklers

1007
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,896
But on top of that you find manufacturers often

1008
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,432
Massively over spec

1009
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,712
Stata CPU

1010
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,248
Necessary

1011
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,784
To do these other things

1012
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,832
I was just simply because it's actually notes

1013
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:34,208
Any more expensive to use a more powerful CPU in a lot of cases than it is to use a less powerful CPU

1014
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,536
Simply because of the full light for the smartphone

1015
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,096
I agree and I think

1016
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,912
Figuring out inefficient and

1017
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,472
Secure distributed architecture

1018
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
Accountability

1019
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,288
He's going to make a huge difference

1020
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,592
That's why I'm really excited about what

1021
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,616
Thinking about

1022
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,384
Are there

1023
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,455
More things to talk about here have you figured out

1024
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:00,063
Anything else or are you playing around with other ideas around this that we should talk

1025
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,111
Do you want to talk about blockchain

1026
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:05,183
So I was going to make a little pissy fun, hey what is this

1027
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,207
Watch it

1028
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,743
Cuz I know it's there

1029
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
Alright let's talk about

1030
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,351
Yep so blockchain is

1031
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,631
Massively missing

1032
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,935
It's not about digital current

1033
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,983
It's not about

1034
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
The exchange of value

1035
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,895
Essentially blockchain is just a way to write to record a log of events

1036
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,687
And it's designed to be immutable

1037
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,967
If you discard the height

1038
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,271
It's a mechanism for reaching

1039
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:36,159
Consensus regarding the states of a shared database between multiple parties who fundamentally don't

1040
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
Trust each other

1041
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,487
Write this is actually why I think

1042
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
It's so

1043
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
Powerful

1044
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,583
For iot because it's both scalable

1045
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,119
And gives you a kind of build

1046
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,423
So I'm like yeah

1047
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,471
Alright so how does blockchain fit in

1048
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
You're talking about

1049
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
Well

1050
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
The whole concept of

1051
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,847
Visa decisions

1052
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,639
This is that you have to have

1053
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,199
Some sort of accountability between the devices

1054
00:42:59,455 --> 00:42:59,967
In the architecture

1055
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:00,991
Brightside

1056
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:06,367
When we talk to each other you have to have some sort of memory about what this device told you last time

1057
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,903
I just actually turned out

1058
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
Trick

1059
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:12,511
And you need a way instead of shared consensus

1060
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,047
All keeping track of that

1061
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:19,679
And so that you can also tell all the people that hey you possibly shouldn't trust if you trust me you probably shouldn't Trust

1062
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
This other person

1063
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
By this other device

1064
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:25,055
Essentially what you could do is blockchain could service TripAdvisor

1065
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,223
That was a big jump there okay

1066
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:39,647
So essentially it's a review site that the blockchain is it is it immutable way to store reviews

1067
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
Sensor readings

1068
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,999
Reliable actuator

1069
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,047
If I hey I asked

1070
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:50,655
I ask this thing over here can you turn the heating up can you continue make this

1071
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
The room hotter it never did it

1072
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,495
Never ever responds to requests

1073
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:00,127
This sensor heater continually reads High against all the other senses I know of

1074
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,455
Some reviews shouldn't

1075
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,039
So for instance if you go to the real TripAdvisor

1076
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,855
There are a whole bunch of reviews in hotel rooms in London.

1077
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,647
Complain about the lack of air conditioning

1078
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
The rooms are really small

1079
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,255
For anyone that knows about hotel rooms in London

1080
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,047
That's just how things

1081
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,583
Work so you should

1082
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,655
Push any reliability reviews

1083
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:27,007
So for the same thing for the blockchain reviews all the sensors

1084
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:27,775
If

1085
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:32,383
There's a series of reviews that are obviously unreliable because they disagree with

1086
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,919
Your view of reality

1087
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,199
Then you ignore them

1088
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,735
The way I said

1089
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:40,319
Plum blockchain into this the city of Architecture is

1090
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,135
It's bear as a shared record

1091
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,927
Of whatever one thinks of everyone else

1092
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:50,047
So what happens when the one-off malicious data so let's go back to your

1093
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:50,815
Vineyard

1094
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,607
I don't know why this

1095
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,631
Censor decided

1096
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
To tell the sprinkler

1097
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
But

1098
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,703
Let's say I was

1099
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,239
I wanted to hack this Vineyard

1100
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,031
I would put this data in

1101
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,567
How would that can at work

1102
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
Can practice with you

1103
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,639
Obscure architecture

1104
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:09,759
Call everything has a unique identity and in the case of the vineyard it was a hack

1105
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
And

1106
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,575
They effectively

1107
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:16,671
They injected a piece of malicious data onto the the zip beanie

1108
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:20,255
And that was forwarded through the zigbee mesh to

1109
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
The edge

1110
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,303
Where the

1111
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:28,703
The computer that drove the sprinkler system. Stop beta I went out there's a little moisture reading I have to turn on

1112
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
The sprinklers

1113
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,007
Add a course

1114
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,823
The problem was that it was injected for all

1115
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,383
It was a piece of data that was injected with a randomizer

1116
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,687
There really was no sensor

1117
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,967
That existed on that net

1118
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,271
It was creating that piece of dates

1119
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,831
The shadow sensor

1120
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,879
It was a shadow sensor yeah

1121
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:53,535
So the obvious thing to do in in this area barkitecture is while I've never heard from that device before why should I trust it

1122
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,583
What would happen in our cases

1123
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,143
The computer driving the sprinkler system would go

1124
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:04,543
Hey can I have a sensor reading from all the senses I really trust about what the the moisture levels are and say we go

1125
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,079
Do I ask for for the sensory

1126
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,383
It wouldn't ignore it cuz that would be that

1127
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,455
Because I effectively what you're doing is you're trying to

1128
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:15,039
Responsive effectively in this case of an emergency right it's like

1129
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,831
It's an emergency I need to water so

1130
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,647
Even ignore it but you would ask the clarification

1131
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,671
Seaweed mask

1132
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,743
Ozen sushi nearby hey can you tell me

1133
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,767
Is it dumpster

1134
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,071
And it would get back to reply

1135
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
Shirts

1136
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,167
Spine here come down bring beer it's all fine

1137
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,703
Out of a pony with dead

1138
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:37,567
Proceed to login to the blockchain hey this particular sensor I which I've never heard about

1139
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:40,383
Seems unreliable to me possibly you shouldn't

1140
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919
Any notice

1141
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,455
Got it all right

1142
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
Now

1143
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,759
To build this architecture

1144
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,575
I feel like we need a lot of things are you actively

1145
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:51,647
Trying to build mock-ups of this where are you in terms of me

1146
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
Making this reality

1147
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,207
I'm at the point where I am

1148
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,487
Software

1149
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:58,047
Demos so I obviously have software simulation

1150
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
Signs

1151
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:04,703
It's a 1/2 thing I'm playing with a model of the vineyard that started me down this track

1152
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:10,335
In the first place so I have sensors and I have actuators and I have bits of computer

1153
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:15,455
Flowing documents between all of these so right now I'm not Resorts limited I'm not

1154
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,223
Putting on Act

1155
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
Mitchell Hardware

1156
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
Deploy

1157
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,319
It's all sitting all about

1158
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,135
Half-a-dozen ec2 nodes in the cloud

1159
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:28,511
I think that this set of malicious Tater injection is Mal de to injection something we going to see moral

1160
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,303
When the it becomes

1161
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,583
I think

1162
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,399
Right now the security problems we've seen

1163
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,191
Things Are

1164
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,727
Should we go with unsubtle

1165
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,263
Yes but

1166
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:44,639
If you think about information warfare that's essentially what this is you're going up and giving bad information

1167
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,431
To someone something

1168
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,711
And they've got to figure out

1169
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,735
How to handle that

1170
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,551
Alistair thanks for giving us this

1171
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,111
New way of thinking about architecture for iot

1172
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,927
And thank you also for coming on the show this week
