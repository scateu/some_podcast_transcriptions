I love the steps

37
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Because

38
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,800
I always feel bad when we can't answer everybody's questions

39
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,104
That we get so I'm like woah yay

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384

College try

00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
So

44
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
First step

45
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,648
We have a message from

46
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
Frank

47
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
Big eyes

48
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232
Love the show thank you

49
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
So much for

50
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
All you do

51
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792
Coyote

52
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
Chifans

53
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
I'm trying

54
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
Find some way

55
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,424
To use sensors or

56
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
Other iot

57
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,216
Qi devices

58
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
To trigger

59
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
An announcement

60
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
Could be the weather

61
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
Close or something but

62
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
It seems very complicated online

63
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
She is my

64
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,712
SmartThings setup

65
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
To trigger in an ounce

66
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,272
Very kind

67
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
And wondering if you have

68
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
An easy way to do things

69
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
I also think that

70
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
The new Amazon

71
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Routine

72
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
My shortcut

73
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,488
Process quite a bit

74
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
I wanted your thoughts

75
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
Thank you so much

76
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,328
Oh

77
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
Frank

78
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,632
I am sad to tell you

79
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,424
There's a little confusion about

80
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,960
We couldn't figure out

81
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,240
Migraine wanted

82
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
Have

83
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,568
Make SmartThings talk to my connect

84
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,104
Active speakers and make them

85
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,408
Say things to me but I think what you actually

86
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
Why is smart speakers

87
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
Have things trigger on them

88
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,784
We actually talked about this about a month ago

89
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,856
When we talked about an app called notify me

90
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
So

91
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
There is

92
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,464
That and that is for the Amazon Echo

93
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
Devices

94
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
And

95
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
The other option

96
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
Is in routines

97
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
They're actually a

98
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,728
A few devices that will be able to trigger a notification on your Amazon

99
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
Echo devices

100
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,824
Right now they're pretty limited ring is one of them

101
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,152
And so Emotion Detector on your ring doorbell cam

102
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Actually trigger notify

103
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
Vacation on your Amazon

104
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,272
Echo the challenges

105
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,832
It doesn't actually say anything out loud

106
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
It just turns the light

107
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
Ring

108
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,184
Yellowy color and then you say

109
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Mel Torme

110
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
Do I have notifications

111
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
And she

112
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
I will say

113
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
Yes

114
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
Do you want to hear them

115
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
Will say yes

116
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
And then she will tell you what happened

117
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
So it's

118
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,216
It's not really a push situation but that's

119
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
Probably less annoying

120
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
For most cases

121
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:30,176
I don't know what do you think yeah it's not ideal I certainly understand why it's been implemented that way and I see

122
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:35,296
Sync Amazon in any other speaker maker should add an option to say if I have a notification just

123
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,856
Shout it out don't put that extra step in there

124
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,928
Unfortunate that extra step is there right now so

125
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
Yeah I'd like to see like where you could opt

126
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
But I also see Bryant

127
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,352
You probably want to opt into it and it probably only want to opt into it

128
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
But during certain times of the

129
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:55,776
Just like your phone notifications which is how all of these devices send you notifications today typically so yeah let's

130
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,616
Can replicate the notification controls that we have in these apps

131
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Right on the speakers

132
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200
Now if you want to use your SmartThings

133
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,760
Things to trigger announcements or things to happen

134
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
On your speakers

135
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:13,440
Right now you can't do it for your smart speakers but you can do it for the Bose soundtouch and various Samsung

136
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
Multi-room speakers

137
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,559
And in that case what you can do as you connect those devices to SmartThings

138
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,143
And if a certain person enters the room or something happens

139
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
Your speakers

140
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
Play a noise

141
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,495
So that is not exactly what you're after

142
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,799
But it may get you part way there

143
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
So Frank I am sorry for the bad news

144
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
If anybody else has some ideas

145
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
4 franc

146
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
Boy let us know

147
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Okay

148
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Next up

149
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,551
We have a message from

150
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
Dylan also

151
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
Tell me about smart speakers

152
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159

Eric Westervelt

156
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Smart speakers

157
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
So I'm feeling

158
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
And

159
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
Install door speakers

160
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
Stealing that are

161
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
The ceiling

162
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
Simplifying one manufacturer

163
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
That

164
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,823
Snakes a CO2

165
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Smoke detector

166
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
Bose speaker

167
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
Just looking for something that

168
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
Compatible with Google or

Hockey stores

171
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
Don't have any preference

172
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
But why

173
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
Your preferences

174
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,415
Old houses on the market

Feeling Sparks

176
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,303
So we have good news for Dylan because

177
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,095
He's an advantageous

178
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Situation right now

179
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:31,519
If he's got a new home build it's a lot easier to do speaker mounts for some of these smart speakers

180
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823
And it's actually not too expensive

181
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,127
There is a company that makes

182
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,455
A flush mount system for walls or ceilings

183
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
4

184
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
Or either I guess I should say the

185
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
Echo Dot

186
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
And the Google home Mini

187
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,415
Sell the company or the brand is Mount

188
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Genie

189
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,511
I have not used these I do not have a new home build butt

190
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
Food ideas with a

191
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:59,679
Drywall saw a little bit of wiring the more expensive one surprisingly are for the Amazon

192
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,495
Echo dot M14 20 bucks

193
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,567

A free Google home Mini

195
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:12,735
SB company makes or sells one for $15 or 5 for $50 so if you have a choice

196
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
I probably go with the Google home Mini

197
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
Devices and then use the speaker mounts because they're like cheaper in any case they come with everything you need is a template to

198
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,743
Cut into drywall but of course if you have a new home build you really

199
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,023
Aren't cutting into

200
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,327
Existing drywall you like a little work around it

201
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
And they also come with

202
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,935
Wires that will connect for the power

203
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
I noticed one thing for the one that

204
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,799
The echo.dot uses it cuz of the ten foot cord

205
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,871
Where's the one with the Google home mini they only supplies 6 foot cord

206
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:44,223
Brigand new home build you can probably have your electrician use whatever power

207
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,295
Wires he or she wants to use just a wire these up

208
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:53,695
So expensive the sound might be a little Waffle they seem to have like a Sound Chamber to help with that because some of those be

209
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
Figures the. So particular the sound comes from the base

210
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
Of the echo Dot and that

211
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,863
Kind of gets covered up by this little speak so

212
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
Probably another reason consider the home mini ones but that's just my opinion so it's not too expensive if you're a do-it-yourself kind of purse

213
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,591
Person and don't mind doing a little wiring you should be able to do this

214
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,431
And it's not again a new home build just asked for electrician to do it

215
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
They love that

216
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
They'll do that for you all

217
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
Day

218
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
As long as you're paying yes they will

219
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:27,487
That and just so you know cuz usually speakers when you put them in your ceiling the slow low voltage thing but

220
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,023
Actually Mount smart

221
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,095
Speakers that will be a normal voltage thing

222
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,887
Which maven

223
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,703
Someone else can help do it or it made me different

224
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Code required

225
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,055
It depends on your jurisdiction and your local building codes

226
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Okay

227
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
Let's take our next

228
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
Color

229
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
Which is

230
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
From Kimberly

231
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
And she

232
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
Has a question about

233
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Homekit

234
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
And outdoor lighting

235
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
This is actually a fairly common question

236
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
Variations of History Fair

237
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,415
Common question

238
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
So

239
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
I think many of you will find this valuable

240
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
Okay let's hear from Kimberly

241
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
Hi this is

242
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
Kimberly from Florida

243
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
And my husband and I have Smart Home

244
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
We have a

245
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
Arlo cameras

246
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
I'm outside

247
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,799
With Hue motion sensor light

248
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
And we have homekit

249
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
And my question is

250
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
Can we write an essay

251
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Statement

252
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
Is there a way

253
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,831
To make it so that when the motion sensor light comes on

254
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,903
The after a period of time it will go off

255
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Right now

256
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,743
We have a raccoon or other little

257
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
Visitor

258
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
The light goes on

259
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
And it stays on until Emmanuel

260
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Shut the light off

261
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
Thank you so much

262
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Have a great day

263
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,775
So this was actually pretty easy to resolve kind of threw

264
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,591
But if you would like a hidden setting in the

265
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
Philips Hue software the mobile app

266
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,431
There is

267
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,503
A way to create routines in the Philips Hue app

268
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,319
One of those routines is actually a timer

269
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,415
And what you can do Kimberly is go right into the

270
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,719
Two routines tab in the app

271
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
You'll see a timers button

272
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:10,655
Tap that and it'll just say hey click the plus button hurt your first timer you can name it then you could

273
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
Then put in the

274
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,031
Time of the timer like how long do you want before something happens to your lights

275
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
So

276
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:21,151
It could be 1 minute 35 whatever you'd like couldn't be ours if you'd like but I think

277
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:25,759
For a light to come on due to motion sense you're probably looking at about 5 minutes or so

278
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Then you just choose where

279
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,599
This is going to run meaning what

280
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
Seen or rooms

281
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,183
I probably put the lights

282
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:38,047
In a room by themselves called outside or maybe the by the drive I call it driveway for example

283
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Once you

284
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,911
Said where you can then choose what action to take

285
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
And when you

286
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
See the actions

287
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
There's a bunch of

288
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,335
Different choices such as dim night light mode last on staybright

289
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
There's also an author

290
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,455
Option which is what you want so choose the off option

291
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
Save it

292
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
And you should be all set

293
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:02,879
Therefore when your Arlo camera detects motion and turns on your Hue Lights

294
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,207
That should trigger this Hue routine for the timer

295
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,791
Which would then shut the light off after the time you specified when you set it up

296
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,703
Just keep in mind that once you set this timer up it's going to continuously run so if you're using those lights

297
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
Or any other purpose which

298
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
I suspect you're not because you're using motion detection

299
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
Fire them off

300
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,407
They're going to just keep shutting off every X number of minutes however

301
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:30,783
That's you sad so that's something to consider it's kind of like you may want to use these lights off a single purpose

302
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,855
At this point because if you're using them for like outdoor parties

303
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,671
Well the lights are going to shut off on everybody for 5 minutes

304
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,975
Which might could make a really cool party games

305
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
Everybody freeze when the lights go off

306
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
I take a shot

307
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
No okay

308
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
I don't know what kind of parties are

309
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Probably not

310
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
All right

311
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Now

312
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
I have disappointing news

313
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
For Sherry

314
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
I Sherry centos

315
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Really

316
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
Great idea

317
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
And so

318
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,687
We'll listen to that and

319
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
Will tell her what we found out

320
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
Hi this is Sherry from North

321
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
North Carolina

322
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,623
Just Alexa knows who I am when I ask a question

323
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,951
Can she automatically increase the volume

324
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
When answering a question

325
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,815
I am curious to know because I'm hard of hearing

326
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
Thank you

327
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
Sherry

328
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
Like I said this is disappointing

329
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,263
I actually reached out to Amazon and there met him a group

330
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
And they said

331
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
Oh

332
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
No

333
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
She can't do that

334
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,175
There's nothing in there that is even remotely able to do that however

335
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,735
On the plus side they said that sounds like a really good idea

336
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,759
And so they forwarded that on to

337
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
To their team

338
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
What does that mean

339
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
I don't know

340
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
Maybe one day you'll get the speech

341
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:44,255
It does sound like a good idea to have different levels of volume for different

342
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
Recognize voices

343
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,887
I mean obviously that's not going to help us hear Tech that makes things worse

344
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,471
But you never know they could take this as feedback and create

345
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,519
Custom volumes for different people

346
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,591
Which would be awesome although I will caution you that it

347
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
It's always louder for you

348
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
That might be

349
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,967
Really bad depending on the certain times of day or What's happen

350
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
But I do like it

351
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
So

352
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,623
Sorry that you had to have it before the Amazon people implemented

353
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
You're getting all the bad news questions

354
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
I know

355
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Okay

356
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,743
Well we have kind of good news for free

357
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,303
This is his second call but

358
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,143
Poor man apparently has had his lights on for 3 weeks now according

359
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,703
This message by the time we've answered it it's been

360
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
But

361
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
Frank has sensors on everything

362
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
And wants to know how to

363
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
Take those off so

364
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Your strengths

365
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Call Lynn

366
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
Hi guys my name is Frank

367
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
Love the show very much

368
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Very very

369
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Have your help

370
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
I'm

371
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Big fan

372
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Sensors

373
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,135
Sensors on everything I can think of

374
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
10 reasons to turn things on

375
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
I guess I did

376
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Seal

377
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
Like we talked about it

378
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
Because my

379
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
She's our

380
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
How to turn

381
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
Things back office

382
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Either

383
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Besan

384
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
An action

385
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
The center or a period of time

386
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
But you can run through that that would

387
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
The awesome

388
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,591
And if you could do it quickly.

389
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Because my life

390
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Lebanon Napa

391
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
3 weeks

392
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
With the sensors and I don't know how to turn

393
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
Okay

394
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
First offering

395
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
I'm going to apologize

396
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
Thanks for leaving you with your lights on

397
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
For forever

398
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Long time

399
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
I'm I'm you may have solved this but

400
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
This is actually something that

401
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,487
I was puzzled by until I realized

402
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
The solution and it's such a

403
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,583
Silly solution I felt kind of like an idiot but it is also

404
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,655
I paid some kind of like really is this the best way to do this

405
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
But it kinda is

406
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,751
And that is for every time that you have a a light

407
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,079
It goes on automatically you have to set an automation to

408
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Make it go

409
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
African

410
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,663
You can do it like we talked about with

411
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,967
Kimberly setting a timer so if you have a light that

412
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
How is only going to be

413
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,551
Motion activated or activated that way

414
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
Doing something like that

415
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,647
If you are

416
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,719
Probably more like oriented around time like bedtime

417
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,023
Then you probably need to set up another

418
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Timer for

419
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
After this time of night

420
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Turn this off

421
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,631
So that is

422
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,423
Unfortunately how that's going to have

423
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
After work and

424
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,103
What sensors it is tricky I have one in my home office or a motion sensor that after a certain hour

425
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
The day I walk in

426
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,943
Obviously it sees me and it turns on the office lights

427
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,039
But if I don't do anything about it those office lights will always stay on

428
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:20,927
Those lights are voice-controlled so I actually just want to go to the office I tell Google home in my case

429
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Shut these lights

430
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Yeah

431
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
And I'm trying to think of other

432
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
I mean I talk to

433
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
Timatim a lot

434
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
Turn off my lights

435
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,727
So you have to do it once you're out of the sensor range in a sense you have to legally leave the room almost Sensei it that's the thing

436
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,311
Yeah or not here's another option let's say it's all down

437
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,639
Stairs or something like that you could program like a smart button

438
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,687
And do the button to turn them off

439
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
And just leave that button in whatever room

440
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
You're not it

441
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,551
Or good night routine at the end of the day

442
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
There's lots of ways to do it but

443
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,623
You actually have to program

444
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
Automatically

445
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
So

446
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
That is our good news bad news

447
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,327
Hey more opportunities to learn and enjoy home automation

448
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,399
Okay here is another question

449
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
About madhumeh

450
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
Clearly

451
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:10,335
Amazon is doing really well in this world because we get a lot of questions about Madam and not that many belt

452
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:14,175
So here we go this is from Chris and he wants to know

453
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
How to

454
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
Who helped make Madam a a little bit more

455
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Convenient

456
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
His iPhone

457
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Let's hear it

458
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Hi Kevin

459
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Stacy

460
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Chris

461
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Wisconsin

462
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Question

463
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
I have

464
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Amanda May

465
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
Smart home devices

466
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,839
Morning and night and

467
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
They run

468
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
FaceTime

469
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
Man words

470
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
I would like to

471
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
No it's pause

472
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Apple is

473
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
We have

474
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
IPhone

475
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
Wondering if

476
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
When we give the command

477
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
Anime

478
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
To say good night

479
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Phones

480
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
And do not disturb mode and in

481
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
In the morning

482
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
Wake up they would come out

483
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
You could help me out any that would

484
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Be great

485
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:01,023
So Chris I am right there with you cuz I typically do use an iPhone

486
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
I'm not a

487
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,351
Big user of homekit

488
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
Unfortunately for you and for me

489
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,239
There's really no way to do this at least not one that I have found

490
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,799
After extensive searching and testing

491
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,103
Creating all kinds of routines and such

492
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
The problem is

493
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
Apple really locks down

494
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
What has access to its

495
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
Phone's features

496
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:27,647
You can use Siri to set your phone to go into Do Not Disturb mode or you could program it by time

497
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,975
Without side of the Apple world I have not found a way to

498
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:36,607
To do that so I mean I've even looked at trying to use the homekit features in the home

499
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Software app

500
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:43,775
2 when you shut a light that's homekit enabled do something in the phone but unfortunately in the home app you can only control

501
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,895
Other homekit devices in the iPhone is not a homekit device in that regard so

502
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:55,295
There's just no easy way to do it with Madam and I have found so that means you need to either speak another come on before

503
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,855
It's time for bed or you need to schedule it

504
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
Not great options

505
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
But those are the only two we have at this point

506
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Glad I don't have an iPhone

507
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
So that's

508
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,631
It's pretty straightforward our next answer

509
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,447
In question really is not a straightforward so

510
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
We're going to get in here

511
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:17,055
Jamie wants our opinion of the home assistant DIY Pro

512
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,663
And this is kind of like openhab or homebridge it's another kind of

513
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
You run it yourself

514
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,527
Some other computer in your house

515
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
Sand

516
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,855
It's really powerful but it is also

517
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,671
Maybe not the friendliest ecosystem for newbies

518
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
This particular person's question

519
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Covers

520
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,047
Olive home assistant and specifically

521
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
Using it

522
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
With wired alarms

523
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,143
So let's hear from Jamie

524
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
Hi Stacy and Kevin

525
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:48,799
Mine Jamie Campbell and I'd like to know what your opinion is of the

526
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
Home assistant

527
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,407
Open source DIY home automation project

528
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,783
Shameless episodes ago Stacy mentions the konnected alarm panel it sounds like the

529
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,671
Perfect solution using all the wired Burglar Alarm sensors which are already installed in our house

530
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:12,095
Integration with modern home automation wired sensors are reliable and

531
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,399
Batteries connected panel works

532
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,727
Where's the Home assistant project which sounds interesting

533
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:22,079
And your opinion will the home assistant project be viable in the long run

534
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:28,479
Is it easy enough to use for the next owner of our house to consider it an asset and how well does it integrate with

535
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
Other office shelf sensors

536
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,831
Thanks a lots look forward to your answer by

537
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Okay Jamie

538
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,927
Because you know what home assistant is

539
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
I'm going to assume that you're

540
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
Self-selecting into the type of people who are like

541
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
They don't see a board

542
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,607
Can go by the way what is that

543
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,447
Yes I can play and customize and do crazy things

544
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
If you are that person home assistant

545
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
Is lovely

546
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,543
It actually has

547
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
Much better

548
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Interface

549
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,127
It still could be prettier

550
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
But it's

551
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
It's much better than it used to be

552
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
And it has a large

553
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
Community of people who are

554
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,087
Putting things on the home assistant Forum boards that

555
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,391
You can find all kinds of ways to cook

556
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
Control example Utah

557
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
Wired alarms

558
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
There are honestly

559
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
Doesn't

560
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,351
You can actually connect and with lovey instruct

561
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
If you were comfortable doing that

562
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,191
I'm going to go ahead and recommend

563
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,727
Connected with a k

564
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,031
Alarm system because that's actually easy enough

565
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
I could do it

566
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,871
It was still a little intimidating but it wasn't

567
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,663
I didn't have to

568
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,687
I have my own life

569
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
Relays

570
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,015
Tri-center suck it whatever is in

571
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
Things that I barely

572
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,879
Comprehend what they are this was a very simple process

573
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
WhatsApp videos online

574
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:45,279
Support me through it and if you already have wired device isn't connected panel there's a

575
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,095
Decent chance it may work with that depending on the brand

576
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,375
Yeah they have

577
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Tons

578
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
So

579
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,959
That's part of it and then the other thing is

580
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
I'm going to stay home assistant

581
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,287
If you want to go that route

582
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
I wouldn't feel

583
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,919
If you're comfortable spending that time and effort I would say go for it is

584
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,479
A community the people who are doing it

585
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
Die Hard

586
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,551
Fans of the stuff I don't

587
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,599
See it like it has a very robust

588
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,671
Community that is still contributing it's not like I seen it drop off

589
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,231
In fact I've seen the community grow over time

590
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
So

591
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:22,399
I will also drop a link into the show notes to a epic video it's an hour-long update published in

592
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,983
About how home assistant is doing and what's coming next

593
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
It will help you

594
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,055
They have some big things planned so

595
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
If you're up for it

596
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
Do it

597
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:35,967
And one of the other reasons to consider doing it it's all local there's no

598
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,295
Cloud involved in a lot of people like that local ability to

599
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,343
Keep their data kind of within the home

600
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,879
Yeah that is very true

601
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
I will say

602
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,695
Since I'm in this mindset right now is some

603
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
Someone who's selling their home

604
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
Everything you do

605
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,071
It's not something you're going to be able to hand over to somebody

606
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
Later so

607
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
You're going to move in a year

608
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Maybe don't do

609
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
That's just where it again

610
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519
And that's where my headspace is at right now

611
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,055
Are you guys I'm just like a hoe

612
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
How am I going to document

613
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
The stuff for people

614
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
I can't

615
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
This goes out

616
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,223
Alright let's take a break

617
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,271

So

630
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
By golly

631
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,296
Start your new year off right with a smarter home

632
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
Thanks to Schlage

633
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,624
I'm a call in from our New Year's party

634
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
Yeah Kevin you're not allergic

635
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
For the win

636
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,512
No no I know but it damn sure didn't message because of music

637
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,048
True

638
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,840
I didn't think about that part of it

639
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
Please do,

640
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,936
I would love to hear it and publish it on the show

641
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,472
Okay

642
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Let's get

643
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Back

644
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
To it

645
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,848
Back to the grindstone Kevin we have got more

646
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
Questions to

647
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
Answer

648
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
This one

649
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,456
We get a variation of this every week so

650
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,528
Let's do it this one is from Brent with a quest

651
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
About Wi-Fi

652
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Let's hear from Brent

653
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Hi this is

654
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
Is Brandt from Roy Utah

655
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:26,048
I have a shop that I'm building its back into my property is not that far from the house but

656
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
I definitely will need to put in

657
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
Something.

658
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,144
Extend the Wi-Fi out there

659
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,216
So I can monitor a 3D printer in a few weather

660
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
Items like that

661
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,336
I know how to extend it but I'm looking for options that might be

662
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,152
A little bit more functional or maybe even

663
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
Cool

664
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,480
I know I've heard there's some

665
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
Start speakers

666
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,040
That maybe work is

667
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,112
Place an extender I'm just looking for ideas

668
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
Let me know

669
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
Thanks

670
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
So this

671
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,816
Question is actually fairly easy because there are so many good options

672
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
I am kind of particular to using

673
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,424
Google Wi-Fi but there are other

674
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
Mesh

675
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,008
Options out there Linksys has one

676
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
Orbi

677
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,640
I mean there's so many euro

678
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,688
But part of me says if your

679
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,480
Building a shop out back

680
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:22,880
Depending how far it is I don't know Stacy you think it makes sense actually run a wired connection out there and then

681
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
Maybe

682
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
Extended that way

683
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
True

684
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
I mean okay

685
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:31,328
Okay so this is me I love wired I literally have an ethernet port

686
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,656
It sometimes too in every single room of my house including my kitchen

687
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,496
So you're talking to a lady whose like hey can I rent some conduit

688
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,568
Flush some Cat6 cables and ethernet through here

689
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,360
If you answered yes then by God

690
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
That's what I'm going to do

691
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,432
So if you have that option

692
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
I'm all for that

693
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,040
Because then you could do cool stuff like have like 4K video

694
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Out there

695
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,880
That's going to be a little bit better but no maybe you don't need that yet

696
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,464
Again if you're going to extend just Wifi really any mesh the

697
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
It's going to be good

698
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,816
Would you actually wait until it like a new

699
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:08,704
Round of mesh routers comes out because Brian was saying you know do we know of anything coming down the pike that might be useful

700
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
In terms of

701
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:16,128
Smart Homes with Wi-Fi anytime soon

702
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
With those in terms of new products

703
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,760
But you have to remember is even if your router is like the sickest

704
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,576
Most awesome WiFi 6 router out there

705
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,624
And now we're no longer calling it like a x

706
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,928
Even if you do that

707
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,744
You got to remember that the other the receiving

708
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
Also have

709
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
Has to be a x

710
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
Or Wi-Fi 6

711
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
Compatible

712
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
To get all of those

713
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,704
Advantages right so most bones right now

714
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
Especially all the

715
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,288
Connected gear that were throwing out to

716
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
That's all like

717
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
Wales school it's like

718
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,128
Wi-Fi for

719
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,408
Or three even

720
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
So

721
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
You know having

722
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:57,344
The latest and greatest is really going to only affect you when they start seeing that in devices so I think you're going to be fine for a while

723
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,928
Okay our next question

724
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Is all about

725
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
Outdoors

726
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
We got a couple outdoor question

727
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,072
Is coming our way so let's get started first

728
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
With j

729
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,632
Let's hear from Jay

730
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,424
Maybe third time's the charm

731
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,472
Kevin and Stacy

732
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Is Jade

733
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,520
From Santa Clarita

734
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Question is

735
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
Temperature sensor

736
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
I've got the

737
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,128
Keen home vents

738
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,712
Paired up with my ecobee thermostat and there's temp

739
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
Retreat centers in

740
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,272
Room but there indoor only of course

741
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,064
That looking for an outdoor temperature

742
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,880
Scepter don't want to go around.

743
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,952
Weather station if necessary

744
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,792
So wondering if you can make any recommendation I also have the

745
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Habitat

746
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
Iot hub

747
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,864
And I've got some

748
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,912
Smoke detectors and another

749
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,192
Just after 2

750
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
Gird up to that so

751
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
When are you going to recommend

752
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,080
Amsterdam temperature sensor for outdoors at all

753
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,872
Zigbee or Z-Wave

754
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
How to hook up to the habitat

755
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,456
Thank you very much in a great show

756
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Enjoy listening

757
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
Figure

758
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Okay

759
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,552
Jay

760
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
I want to do like

761
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,648
Give you a temp sensor cuz I assume you want your temps

762
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,928
Center to actually work

763
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,208
With your smart

764
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,512
So they're plenty of devices out there that

765
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,328
You can like just look outside your like it's 42 degrees

766
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,656
What is really frustrating to me is a lot of connected

767
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,472
Devices like doorbells and even some outdoor cameras

768
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:23,872
How temperature sensors in them but they're not visible to you unless you're pulling up something like openhab or Eve

769
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Even Homosassa

770
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:28,224
So I'm going to assume that you're a normal person who isn't going to do that

771
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
And you're going to need a dedicated outdoor

772
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Temperature sensor

773
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
Inference that

774
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,856
I am going to recommend

775
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
Bnet at

776
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,976
They actually just got bought by a grand they have a netatmo weather station

777
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,512
And it is

778
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,328
I am expensive it's usually on sale around the holidays

779
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
This is what I've used

780
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,680
In the past to know what the weather is outside it is

781
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,728
$180

782
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,008
You can also buy it with

783
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
The rain gauge

784
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
If you want and

785
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,848
And then you can actually get it for like 200

786
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
And

787
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:01,760
Yeah that's my big recommendation cuz you can actually pull that data in through other services like a gift

788
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
And then

789
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,808
Tie that information

790
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,600
Did you like your Hue Lights or something like that

791
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,928
And if you don't want to buy anything new because

792
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
Why not save money right

793
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
You can always

794
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Speaking again

795
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,560
If go use Weather Underground

796
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,120
See if anyone has like a weather station near you

797
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,656
And that might be

798
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
Close enough

799
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
To work and then you can basic

800
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
Just pull that data end

801
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,080
Weather Underground says it's 42 degrees do the following with

802
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
At home stuff

803
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,664
And that's actually something that I've done

804
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,504
In the past I've turned my Hue Lights blue when it was below freezing outside

805
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
And

806
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
Yeah that was

807
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,600
Kind of a fun little thing I did when I was

808
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,160
Trying to get ready early in the morning with the dog and

809
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
Now I just look at

810
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,720
My Fatima a device

811
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:48,096
Do using somebody else's weatherstation what's next somebody else's wife I never

812
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,144
Never never mind

813
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,192
Okay

814
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,776
So that I probably use you

815
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,568
No no they don't

816
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
I have a lovely

817
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
Oh actually they could be

818
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
Because they have the guest

819
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,432
Knots

820
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
It's possible

821
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,320
That's my new excuse for any weird downloads that we see on my Wi-Fi

822
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
From my IP

823
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,904
The address okay other outdoor sensor questions

824
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
This one comes from Bruce

825
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Let's hear it

826
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,560
Santa Fe

827
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
I live on a

828
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
1/2 Lots

829
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:25,728
In our driveways by 300 feet long I'd love to have some sort of the

830
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,080
Sensor that tells me when somebody is pulled into our driveway in

831
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,384
Send me notification of some

832
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,688
Is that something that can be done relatively

833
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
By the way since I live in Santa Fe

834
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,808
Where were you

835
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
300

836
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
30 days

837
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
Every year

838
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,184
This word set up

839
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
Solar recharging

840
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,024
Look forward to your response

841
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
Okay Bruce

842
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,656
I don't know how long your driveway is which does change my recommendation

843
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
Just a little bit

844
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:00,800
But the bottom line is if it's too far away if you can't use any of the popular thing

845
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
Things like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth

846
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
Were 50 years away

847
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,736
So that throws you into this weird other

848
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,016
So that's

849
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,088
If your driveway super long you're going to be in the land of

850
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,112
Dedicated

851
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,392
Driveway sensors

852
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,696
Which companies like Chamberlain

853
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
I found a company called guard line

854
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,792
It also makes a really well-reviewed system

855
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,096
These are going to use a different radio

856
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,120
Technology that

857
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
I can go farther

858
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
In

859
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
Guidelines

860
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
In particular

861
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,496
They have one that will go

862
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,032
Auto quarter mile

863
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,824
And then they have one for a little bit closer

864
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,616
What they do is

865
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
The

866
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,408
Sensor

867
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
Is battery powered

868
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,224
When it's triggered

869
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,528
It'll send an alarm at alert

870
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
Alarm

871
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,600
And that's good enough for you and the alarm can be back

872
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
Back in your house

873
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
Then that's great

874
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,720
If you wanted to actually do something like turn on your porch light

875
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
That's where things

876
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,816
Skyline lets you

877
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,840
Tie into a

878
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:59,936
A 12-volt switch so what you can do is you take the receiver you take off the back

879
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,216
Can you wire

880
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
Whatever switch you want

881
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
To that

882
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
Device

883
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,848
And then when the sensor is triggered

884
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,944
And instead of like the alarm actually going off on the receiver what'll it do it is it

885
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,968
Google say hey

886
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
Something just happened

887
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
My state just changed

888
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
Now

889
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
To bring that back and

890
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,136
Smart home you're going to need some

891
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
I'm pretty heavy lift

892
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,952
SmartThings is going to be your best

893
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,280
Because they have a dedicated community

894
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
So import

895
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
And

896
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
There's plenty of discussion

897
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,400
About wifi-based

898
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Relays

899
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,704
For 12 volt

900
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Contact

901
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Sensors

902
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,544
Yeah those are all things you're going to want to go

903
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,616
Until what you'll do is you'll take your 12 volt contact

904
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,920
Center that converts to Wi-Fi

905
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
Wire that too

906
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,968
State changes

907
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,760
Send a notification over Wi-Fi

908
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Then

909
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
You're going to have to program

910
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
SmartThings

911
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
App that you watch

912
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
Actually

913
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
Do something with that

914
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,768
So that's a really long way of saying it's going to be kind of a pain in the butt so

915
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,304
This may not be the

916
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
Best option

917
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,864
The Garland stuff is about a hundred bucks

918
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,168
You can buy the Wi-Fi

919
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
The12volt to.wifi stuff for

920
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,496
Between actually

921
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,776
10 +

922
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,568
5 + $20

923
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,896
The other option I want to give you especially if you have Wi-Fi

924
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,176
Play all the way out there

925
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:14,944
Is

926
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
Kind of Overkill

927
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
But it will work

928
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Ring make

929
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,528
Fix a camera

930
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,808
Called the spotlight

931
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,624
If you take the ring Spotlight cam

932
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,648
In a solar panel

933
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,952
You can actually put that out there

934
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,744
If you have the Wi-Fi

935
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
I think can get that far out

936
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
Then

937
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,632
That will actually send you that ties directly into

938
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
You all kinds of smart home systems

939
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
And you can do that so

940
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,008
That tho will cost you

941
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,056
$229

942
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,592
For the camera and the solar panel

943
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
But

944
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,640
It is a stand-alone thing

945
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,176
Is predicated though

946
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,224
Are you having Wi-Fi as far out as the edge

947
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,784
Keep your driveway and then you get both the camera and emotion

948
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,624
Which I know it feels like Overkill but really there are

949
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,672
No outdoor capable

950
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,976
Wifi-based sensors that we

951
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
Find

952
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
If any of you out there

953
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
Have them

954
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,120
It also alleviates any wiring

955
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,168
Which is a big big plus I think

956
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,216
All of the solutions I told you where wire

957
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,264
Well except for the

958
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,080
Oh I see the voltage that I was thinking about like none of these things have

959
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
But yes

960
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,896
That the wiring

961
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,456
That's not hard wiring you could totally do it

962
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,480
Okay

963
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,760
Just don't like it

964
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
12

965
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,600
I mean

966
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
Could you look it

967
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,416
I'm like have you ever licked a 9 volt battery

968
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,488
At my daddy

969
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
To do that to me cuz he's

970
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:38,400
Sometimes I let the dog like it pay does not like that you are so mean

971
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
Small children

972
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,496
Okay

973
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
Norm

974
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,336
Okay

975
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,408
I feel like we're done with Outdoors let's go indoors

976
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,224
Two Echo skills for middle schoolers

977
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,528
Dean has like a raped

978
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
And we cannot

979
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
Wait

980
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
To tell you what

981
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
So let's hear

982
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
From Dean

983
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,464
7

984
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
Try this one more time

985
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,560
16 and I'm a designer body

986
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,584
Steve Perry

987
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,400
I have the genius our kids that just loved

988
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,192
You thought you were talking about writing

989
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,728
Nikolas and so on

990
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,008
And why isn't it

991
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
Can we write

992
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,080
Stills or

993
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
NFL

994
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:22,944
Can we do something with iot and I was curious how

995
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Still at 8

996
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
This Quest

997
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:28,320
In and see it from the perspective of middle schoolers

998
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,624
Because they are native to this

999
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
Technology

1000
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
Any help would be

1001
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,464
Great I

1002
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,232
Would appreciate

1003
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,024
Thanks in advance in

1004
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,304
Totally love your show

1005
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:43,936
So can I just say I love this question Dean I'm a big believer in

1006
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
Stem

1007
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,800
Young people learning to code in Tinker and make

1008
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,824
So this is awesome

1009
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,896
And you are in luck if you have not seen it yet

1010
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
On the

1011
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,968
Amazon developer site

1012
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
4

1013
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,016
Madam age

1014
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
Skills

1015
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
There is a kids

1016
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,344
Section end

1017
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,720
We'll put a link in the show notes all that you could probably just Google Madam a skills

1018
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:11,584
Kit for kids which is how I found this at I spent like an hour

1019
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,888
Just pulling through everything on here

1020
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,192
So everything here is geared towards

1021
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,520
Kids under the age of 13 and that's important because

1022
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:24,896
Amazon provide all the information you need to satisfy the privacy and

1023
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
Compliance laws

1024
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:31,040
And the parental consent laws for kids cuz that's obviously a part of this even if you're just doing this

1025
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
In a classroom I think you

1026
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,856
Probably seems to want to follow those

1027
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,416
There's also some amazing little

1028
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,696
How do I say

1029
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,280
Tips not just tips but some really cool tools you can use

1030
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,096
Have you heard of speech cons before

1031
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,632
Con con

1032
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,168
See I have not

1033
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,472
I'm going to play one or two the right now

1034
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,776
Speech cons are little interjections

1035
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,824
Can you can have Madam a reed

1036
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,848
Any word

1037
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
As

1038
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,432
In a certain way let me give you an example

1039
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
Alrighty

1040
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
Aloha

1041
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
Yoga

1042
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,880
Certain interjections kind of got a little more personality than the same old same old

1043
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,976
And I think it would just love you too faced Peach concept

1044
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:17,376
There's hundreds of them there's hundreds of them and on top of all that getting back to the heart of the question

1045
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
There are

1046
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
Kids

1047
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,984
Skill tutorials and I followed through with one

1048
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,032
And I'm not going to lie. There's some

1049
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:30,176
Working bother me an Amazon has made this easy as possible but it's more than just like building say the

1050
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,224
Voice interface and the responses

1051
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,552
You have to go through after you've done that because

1052
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,344
For example they build a quiz

1053
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,744
Game skill in there tutorial on Michael this is easy once you get the first part done then you have to go and build

1054
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,304
Amazon AWS Lambda function

1055
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,328
And then link

1056
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,888
Wii user interface to that code

1057
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:53,728
So not trying to scare you I'm just saying you may want to

1058
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:58,592
Do the Lambda function for the kids and let them work on the user interface you link the two

1059
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,152
And then they can test it customize it and heck

1060
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
If it's

1061
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,224
Really awesome and they want to share it with other kids

1062
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,296
You all can publish it to the Alexa skills

1063
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:13,696
Library so another good reason to follow all those legalities and things in case you decide you want to publish it so just

1064
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,792
At the site go through it I don't think you need to be a heavy-duty Kotor to get

1065
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,352
What you want done and again I think of you

1066
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:24,960
The kids focus on the voice user interface you can tell them how you're going to tie it together with

1067
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,240
AWS in the cloud

1068
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,032
But you probably won't do that part yourself

1069
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
Very cool

1070
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
I kind of want to do this now too

1071
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
I want it to say awooga

1072
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:32,896
All the time

1073
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,688
Actually I don't know why that

1074
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,712
What's tickling me so much

1075
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,736
But it really is

1076
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,808
Okay

1077
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:48,256
Sorry there's just so many and you can just keep clicking on them up here's one of my favorites before we leave this one

1078
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,632
Alright does Google have anything like this

1079
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,656
I am not

1080
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,752
Seen anything like this I'm sure they have ways to modulate the voice but

1081
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,544
I've not seen like a web page

1082
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,944
Filled with hundreds of these that you can play back and then just you know listen to and that you were that's the one I want to use

1083
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,968
You have John Legend

1084
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,784
His voice

1085
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
They don't have that though

1086
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
All right

1087
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:16,928
Teen hopefully this gets you started with projects for your kids for the new year

1088
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,208
Okay

1089
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,744
That concludes

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,816
