00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,376
Bricking iot devices

11
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:42,496
And we've got some cool use cases for

12
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,080
Smart factories are coming to the US

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,616
There's a new Raspberry Pi

14
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
And

15
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:52,480
I found a watch that's really smart and then Kevin tells me he's already had

16
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,528
So

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
All of this

18
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
Plus a little bit more including

How the world of

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,608
Clinical testing is influencing

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,192
How we think about wearables and medical devices for the future

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,264
We're also going to hear from our sponsor Dell technology

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,824
She's all about the open-source Edge

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592

00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,128
So

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,152
Gear Up

Get ready

31
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,784
Here we go starting with a message from another one of our sponsors nordics

32
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
Nordic semiconductor is launching an exciting new cellular iot prototyping platform this August

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,864
Nordic thingy 91 cellular iot prototyping platform is perfect for building a

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,656
Applications using lte-m

35
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
Nb-iot GPS different sensors including hygiene

36
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:55,456
Accelerometers air quality in altitude and many more the Nordic thingy 91 comes with

37
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
Application pre-installed and with a free SIM card for my bases to use anywhere in the world

38
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,256
In addition to Cellular that stinky 91 has an nrf52 8:40 multi-protocol SOC

39
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
I'm bored so you could build exciting hybrid applications

40
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:19,776
At Nordic thingy 91 will be available in August and it is

41
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:26,176
The most exciting thing in cellular right now.com

42
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
It looks fun

43
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,344
I kind of do too I mean I like to Tinker with these kind of things so

44
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,952
Well that's the Nordic thingy 91 but I have

45
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
The Amazon

46
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
Tiny thingy which is the

47
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
Echo Show 2

48
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
Released

49
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,632
Not with much fanfare

50
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
What's released this week

51
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,728
Actually so it's a $90 5 in

52
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,544
Smaller Echo Show that supposed to go in your

53
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,128
Nightstand is probably the ideal location for this it's got a

54
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
Camera

55
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,688
You can shut her that cameraman

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
He is got the microphone

57
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
It does everything else that

58
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
An Echo Show does like tok

59
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
People

60
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,112
And show your

61
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
I don't know certain certain

62
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
Certain

63
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,864
It will not show your nest security cameras but it will show your ring

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
Pro doorbell in

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,192
I believe still your Arlo's so

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
But yes

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,544
Alright so this looks like a direct response

68
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
Monster Google

69
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
Messed up I was like I don't even know what it's called

70
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
Yeah

71
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944
And you have that so what do you think

72
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:36,576
I do have I have the police because of Google home however I guess you can't open Desktop now

73
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:41,952
Mine has a 7-inch display if I recall correctly sitting right in front of me with the microphone off

74
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,048
We actually have two of them I wanted the office I have

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
One in the

76
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
Bedroom

77
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
There is

78
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,424
No camera on it

79
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
Which I kind of like

80
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
But with Echo Show V

81
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,312
Even though it has a camera

82
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,128
You can shut her that you said which is

83
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
Import

84
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
Having

85
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:13,696
Yeah I mean we have a manual shutter on the Lenovo smart display the tonnage one that is down on our kitchen island

86
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,768
And it's usually shuddered Hemingway

87
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,815
Need to hang out with other cameras

88
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,887
In that area anyway for security reasons and such but

89
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
I think it's important

90
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
It's a smarter than hooking up at the camera and I think

91
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
Honestly every

92
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
If I saw the camera should have a shutter at this point

93
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,335
I agree

94
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,615
The original Echo Show

95
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,199
Right so the question is really

96
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Should I buy the

97
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Who should buy

98
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,367
Well I mean if you're on the Madam a platform and

99
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,975
You're in the market for a small display that's not too expensive 90 bucks is reasonable

100
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
Yeah I think it's

101
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
Worth it

102
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583
Do you like your eggs smaller

103
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
Viceroy

104
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
Baidu

105
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,239
I think it does a little bit more

106
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Then the

107
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,871
Devices unless something has changed like YouTube TV iOS

108
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Stream on this thing

109
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,991
Sometimes as I'm working and walking to go watch a soccer match or something

110
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:13,855
The services that I use may not be fully supported on the Echo Show us that's about the best way to say

111
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Fairy taipei

112
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
All right

113
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,487
But if you're all in on Amazon

114
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
You don't want to watch a lot of YouTube

115
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
You know what the other thing is I will say the Google

116
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,887
My favorite thing about my Google displays actually

117
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
The photos of shows

118
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
And

119
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,031
With Amazon do you have the option of storing your photos in it

120
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
Storage place

121
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,663
Does my phone automatically

122
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Google photos which is

123
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,479
Is awesome and so everything I get

124
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,527
Not everything but anything that's in a certain

125
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
File folder

126
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
Basically there's a picture

127
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,135
In there that face matches to my

128
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
My daughter

129
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
My family or friends

130
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Pops right up on my Google photos

131
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:59,935
Right I do the same thing I actually use a custom photo album that are just nothing but pictures of Norm the dog

132
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Works great

133
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
Even if you're looking

134
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,567
IPhone user like even are both using Android right now

135
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:10,175
Maybe you're not tied to Google photos some people do actually use Google photos for

136
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
The free storage on iOS

137
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:17,087
You not likely uploading from IOS to Amazon's total Locker

138
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
Alright so

139
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,023
Let's talk about the new smart

140
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
Kiss

141
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
Samsung

142
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,631
Basically launched a bunch of new stuff

143
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Breathing

144
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,287
They're not terribly expensive cuz I think he's a really aim towards like

145
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,359
You don't have a smart home yet you want like a store

146
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,687
Couple things to get right what do you start with you obviously

147
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
You get the SmartThings Hub

148
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,039
Now they have a new $90 SmartThings camera

149
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,087
Which of the Wi-Fi camera that have a

150
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,647
$18 Wi-Fi smart plug

151
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,719
And a $10 smart bulb

152
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
Which

153
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,535
Might be

154
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,863
Bluetooth is actually sick me so you do neither the hub for that

155
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
And that makes sense

156
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,191
By the way you can get the 3rd Generation SmartThings Hub

157
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Amazon

158
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
Yes it's relatively cheap

159
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
So

160
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,895
Yay I will say for anybody contemplating SmartThings

161
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,063
It's not the most user-friendly platform very powerful you can do a lot especially with automations but there is

162
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Learning curve

163
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
They're so

164
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,647
Be aware it's fun I like it

165
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
I have smart

166
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
There's a lot of people are happier than them and I don't

167
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,303
Think they're wrong obviously they're happy they're happy that's fine

168
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,143
I find smart things to be very sensible as well you could actually

169
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
A non-supportive

170
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
Device on either find or

171
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
Build your own driver to make it work

172
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
Door device Handler is what they call them

173
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
So we can figure out

174
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:49,759
Programmer you can do a lot more with us than you can with I think the other hubs on the market so for everyday people I ate

175
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
Know that the problem that

176
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,903
I guess I have is that we kind of stop recommending wink as that user friendly hub

177
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Yeah disposal

178
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
But wait

179
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,047
Wait we just got an email from

180
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
Scary

181
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
Yasso carry

182
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
In a very sunny

183
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
Set us

184
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Wink

185
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,751
Is alive

186
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
Dirty sprite

187
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,919
Link appears to be in I got this just a few hours ago so I can shut off an email to the week

188
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
People

189
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Got an email from

190
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
Wing said they were reaching out to long-time customers

191
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
To purchase the wink Hub 2

192
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:30,975
And he expected to be. But lo and behold it was not we went to check in

193
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
Yep

194
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,119
No they have actually a lot of it or Wing It branded products available now

195
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,959
If you're interested I'll probably buy them from the wing site the wreck I know you can buy

196
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,263
Some of these devices on Amazon

197
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,311
And even though it's sold by

198
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,103
Amazon from wink the

199
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,919
How to raise $150 for some reason on Amazon

200
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
Wow is supposed to 99

201
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
Yes as opposed to 99 so

202
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,599
Interesting bit to this news is we've been wondering for

203
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
How many year

204
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
Just cuz we haven't heard anything

205
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
Newsworthy out of Lincoln

206
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
That long

207
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,047
Are they still open the business

208
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,607
Sending that still making products in the answer is yes

209
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
Yes cuz it may have been out of stock

210
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
We'll see

211
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,519
We also get software updates for the Hub recently though

212
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
So who knows

213
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
We'll keep an eye on wink

214
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
Maybe

215
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
Gyarados

216
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
How he feels

217
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
All right

218
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Okay

219
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
That's

220
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Good news

221
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Wink

222
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Sarcasm

223
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Oh that's

224
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
It's actually

225
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:38,559
Been a couple episodes where we talk about are needed to talk about a raise awareness of a

226
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:42,143
I'm making a malware or any kind of security issues

227
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
And

228
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,751
This one is really scary that happened this week it's

229
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,103
Called Cyrax and it is basically breaking iot devices

230
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,151
The only way to

231
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Fix

232
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,223
This if you are infected

233
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
Instalike

234
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,551
Kohler install the device firmware which

235
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,647
Most people don't have access to the front of the devices to do that number one

236
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,463
Number to the probably don't know how to do with that

237
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
So

238
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
Ice not good

239
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,071
What's really scary is what we started

240
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
Finding out

241
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399
We just came from and

242
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
Who's responsible

243
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,239
Do you want to talk about that yeah so

244
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,311
This is kind of like my nightmare this is like a teenage prank

245
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,895
Real they tried to hack her back and it's a 14 year old boy

246
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,479
We basically we're creating a world where 14 year old boys kid

247
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
Wreak havoc in

248
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
We all know 14 year old boys in

249
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,623
You're going to grow into lovely people most of them but

250
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
14

251
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
Very few people are

252
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:42,047
Discerning members of society I don't know how else to put that

253
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
He built this and he's like

254
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Hey

255
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,191
I think I'm going to add more features and in

256
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,775
I don't know if he's going to turn into a business you think that's going to happen

257
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
I would hope not I would hope nobody would

258
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,639
Son that business he said

259
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Project

260
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
Kind of a joke but now it's a full-time project

261
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
That's scary

262
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Yeah

263
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
So guys

264
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
We're building a world where

265
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,671
We're getting the tools of Destruction to 1400 Boyson

266
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
14 year olds are going to take it

267
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Boys

268
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Some girls

269
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
You know

270
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
That's what teenagers do

271
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
They make poor decisions

272
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,007
It's not what I did I did some packing when I was that age but it was mostly

273
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,871
Changing the names of characters video games to me and my friends like

274
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:34,015
Good night so we would play a video game instead of dr. J and Larry Bird play basketball that would be me and my next door neighbor

275
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,575
Would be showing on the screen with our names do you know

276
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
I know I mean it

277
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,183
It's not so much

278
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
Alright well maybe one day we'll get

279
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
Microphones throughout her house that will detect

280
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
Teenage boy hacking

281
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
But until then

282
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Schools and hospitals are

283
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
M4

284
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
Weird

285
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
Weird stuff

286
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
So they're using them to detect

287
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Kodak code

288
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Aggression

289
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,199
Which I understand because of all of the

290
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:08,063
Terrible tragedies we've had it in public places where somebody just goes off in people

291
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
Loser lives needlessly

292
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,671
But it gets back to that

293
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:17,791
Cost of privacy and then do you want to be walking through Hospital knowing that you're being listened to the whole time

294
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,863
Maybe you won't even know to be honest it off if you disclose to you

295
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,679
I think disclosure and something like this is important

296
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
And

297
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
I promise to delete that

298
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Recordings

299
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,127
And some sort of independent audit to make sure that that's actually have

300
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,735
Go to think about things again we're dealing in schools not necessarily hospitals

301
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,295
Teenagers and teenagers say a lot of stupid stuff

302
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,367
And they should have the ability to say that stupid stuff and not

303
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
I agree

304
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
So this is on the scary side

305
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Hydrate and

306
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
Here is

307
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,351
The algorithm they are using to detect aggression

308
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,191
Isn't peer-reviewed it's not it's not really proven so

309
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
Now you can set it off by

310
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,311
Again doing all kinds of things that teenagers actually off

311
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Often do like

312
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Scream

313
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Or

314
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,455
And clearly this isn't 100%

315
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,319
Foolproof either that's the other thing that I noticed I think there's a three-year trial

316
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,135
Happy Valley Hospital in Ridgewood New Jersey

317
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
After

318
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,719
For years they were facing out

319
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
Because

320
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,815
You're a lot of things like somebody speaking loud with set it off work

321
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,887
Or somebody slamming a cash register in the cafeteria with Set It Off

322
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,775
So they tweaked it to make it less sensitive and then they missed a very agitated person screaming and pounding on the desk so

323
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
It's clearly not foolproof

324
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,407
People are weird they can go from 0 to 60 in like no time

325
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
On the flip side

326
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
Seriously

327
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Microphone

328
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,671
Always on microphones being used possibly not transparently

329
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
End

330
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
Or something that may not even be

331
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,535
Researchers at the University of

332
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Washington

333
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
Announced last week that they detect

334
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,679
Heart attacks of the breathing associated

335
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
With heart attacks

336
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Figure it out

337
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
When I tried it on and

338
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Amazon Echo

339
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,639
So the idea is they envision

340
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:13,759
Some sort of acolyte device or microphone base device that could listen for this in people's homes and then

341
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
Quickly send help

342
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
There's a heart attack

343
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
Now

344
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,415
That's in my opinion

345
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,719
82 invasive and B

346
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
That's

347
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
Problem is

348
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
I think already solved with wearable

349
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,631
I would agree with you on that

350
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:36,031
I would say though that having a $40 device like an echo. In someone's nursing home

351
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
For example

352
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
Detecting that sort of thing

353
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
To be more cost

354
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
Effective

355
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:45,247
Sure sure you move to Washington State and I are defending University of Washington

356
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:52,159
That's exactly what's happening I would not want this and I would be curious though if I

357
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,207
I were someone who has had a history of heart attack

358
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
Would that change my

359
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Acceptance of some

360
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,375
And would a robust

361
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
Data

362
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
Privacy

363
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,703
Policy I really don't know

364
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,031
And I don't know either but I think about it

365
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,359
People who have no history of heart disease or they

366
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
Suffered a heart attack already

367
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
They probably don't mind

368
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,295
Shelling out money from Modern devices that probably do a better job

369
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,647
Well but what about insurance so Insurance could look this and I could be like

370
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,743
The nice thing about insurance

371
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
Tactics online

372
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Aggression

373
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
Detection

374
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,351
But if you could prove that

375
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:37,983
And then only the inside so not the metadata itself but just the inside of this person is having

376
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Heart attack

377
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,311
If there were enough Protections in place I would

378
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
But there would have to be in

379
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
The places we are not there yet is a pipa

380
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Stefano

381
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,735
So did you see what you can do with sound

382
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
And

383
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Also chair

384
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
Okay

385
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,647
What's the best smart batteries the u.s. is home to two

386
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
You smart

387
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,975
Schneider Electric last week

388
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
They have a factory in Lexington

389
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,375
Chucky that builds load centers and safety switch

390
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,167
Things that are outside your house

391
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,727
Well in an industrial settings there outside

392
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,311
But they control the electricity going in in

393
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
Out to various

394
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Places

395
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
In Philly

396
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
That was a terrible

397
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
But that's what they do

398
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,271
And last week we had the CIA

399
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
On the show

400
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,855
Hey if you miss that

401
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,975
But what they're doing with their smart Factory is there turning into a showcase for their

402
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
Ecostruxure

403
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,327
Products which is building management software

404
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
It ties into

405
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,191
Factory automation software in all of this other stuff

406
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
Cohere sustainability

407
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
I think it's interesting

408
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
They've got

409
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,871
Couple other smart factories when in France

410
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
Mexico

411
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,991
And they seen actually things like a 20% reduction in meat

412
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
Repair on their critical equipment

413
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,599
They've eliminated 90%

414
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,671
Their paperwork or limited paperwork by 90%

415
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
So

416
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Some of those things are

417
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,887
The investment to actually implement this may seem like a lot but when you start looking at the ROI

418
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
I think the payback is free

419
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,983
I think it's this is the investment it takes to Lake

420
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,519
Quit prepping

421
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
That's a cost but

422
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,871
If the value that sits on top of that is amazing

423
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,503
Alright the other smart Factory was announced this week

424
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,807
It is Erikson they are going to

425
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:33,951
Builder first fully automated smart Factory in the US unlike the Schneider Electric Factory this is going to be built

426
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
That one

427
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:41,631
And it is going to build Advanced antenna system radios so this is like

428
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Those are fun

429
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:50,335
So Erickson doesn't have a location I guess they're still negotiating with various Economic Development groups my guess is

430
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
Cool your place

431
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:58,271
They also did announce the new R&D site which just happens to be where you used to live

432
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
Austin

433
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,927
Austin actually has a lot of 5G research AT&T and Intel have a research center there

434
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,511
About lots of Wireless Engineers they're so this makes sense

435
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
The point here

436
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
Smart factories

437
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
They're all the rage this week

438
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
Or maybe Tunis smart Factory

439
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
Tune-ups

440
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,543
Raspberry Pi that is

441
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,079
Powerful

442
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
This is the

443
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,151
Raspberry Pi

444
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
4

445
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,759
They're saying it's designed for industrial iot

446
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
Locations

447
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:37,439
It probably can be used for that but of course I was on campus with my comp sci class and

448
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
I saw this news

449
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
And we're not

450
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,047
Where does Prius

451
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,095
But we want to buy one of these

452
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Just for

453
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
Code projects another little

454
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
Efforts

455
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,775
It's got a quad-core arm cortex a72 process

456
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,359
Running at 1.5 gigahertz that's crazy I think

457
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,455
Well my last MacBook Reddit that

458
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,367
Right right I took a look to see cuz of course everybody ask me when I told him about the snuza what's different from the Raspberry Pi already have

459
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,415
Eeyore

460
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
Are all the runs

461
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,023
The price starts at $35 get you a gig of RAM

462
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,143
You also have options 45 and $55 to get 2 or 4 gig of RAM which

463
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,471
That's great for like for the type of things we would use it for

464
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,567
Also it's USBC for the power which is awesome

465
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
Mitsubishi

466
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
Give me speed Mini

467
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
And they have

468
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Added

469
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
2

470
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,599
Added one but now has two HDMI

471
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,183
Put all of the mini HDMI port

472
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,999
So you can run up to 4k on

473
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,071
Two simultaneous HDMI displays

474
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,399
Yeah and that's really interesting for the industrial iot

475
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Cuz you could start

476
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,751
Play Machines to set up sensors

477
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:59,103
You could actually put this in and monitor that information from the sensors

478
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,407
You can run applications on this that are

479
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Fairly sizable

480
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,759
Hey 35 bucks

481
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,295
Or maybe 50

482
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,367
The other thing is from an industrial standpoint of me

483
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:16,511
Like most consumers, just buy the pie and use it to make it like a desktop computer or Linux Boxes Etc

484
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
Having the

485
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,607
IO pins

486
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,935
And the ability to add okash several dozen

487
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,751
Options of other radios other sensors

488
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
So on

489
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
Really

490
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,639
I think it speaks to the industrial Market meet this that's exactly what we used for

491
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,223
Increase in the clouder are hacking diabetes project we had it up

492
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,759
NRF radio hat

493
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,831
That's it on to our pie so you can so many choices

494
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,623
Yeah and

495
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
I'm assuming that there will be ruggedized cases for

496
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
That is the other thing

497
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
Papaya system

498
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
You can't just leave that in it

499
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,071
Industrial eyeglass

500
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,959
Yeah I thought cases I didn't buy rugged I so I'm supposed to know for 5 or 10 bucks out he's in case my in

501
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,287
Arbonne rep near my hand this act as a clear case so I can see

502
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,823
The parts a new Land Rover

503
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
It would

504
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,111
And then I saw this device and I got super excited

505
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
This is

506
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
The Parlor

507
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
Smartwatch

508
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
What day does

509
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,512
This is

510
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,072
It basically tells you

511
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,608
Where you are at

512
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,192
In your day or if you should exercise or maybe not train a little

513
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
Train too hard

514
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,032
It combines like your sleep

515
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
Your workout

516
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,360
All of this to help you optimize your

517
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,152
Workouts and I like this because

518
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
I left my Fitbit charge 3

519
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Which is what I'm current

520
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,272
You know I love counting steps I love all that but

521
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
It doesn't actually tell me

522
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
How to change to

523
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
It does actually

524
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
Every few hours to get up

525
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,072
For the most part it doesn't feel super smart it just feels like a

526
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
A data logging

527
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,632
Device

528
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,168
This will smart

529
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
So I thought this was cool

530
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,080
Yeah it's not terribly expensive either it's $230

531
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
Pair device play ignite

532
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,688
GPS that has GPS perfectly Runner

533
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
Spike etcetera and so on

534
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,344
Your point about the actual smartness of using the data analyzing and giving you

535
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,904
Actionable information is is key

536
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,720
It's not the first watch to do that

537
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,024
And I say that because I have a Garmin

538
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,864
Forerunner 245 on my wrist right now that I've had for about six weeks

539
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:33,472
Pretty much does the same thing I might become more value from that then

540
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,800
I would have expected instead of just telling you for example

541
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,104
How many hours of sleep you got an

542
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,664
What the different stages were in the time in those stages

543
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,480
It actually has a feature called body battery in

544
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:49,344
Basically if your body battery is 100 you're fully charged and you want to go train hard

545
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,648
The run marathon today is the day to do Etc

546
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,744
It does that and also reduces the body battery based on how many steps you taken and

547
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,816
Your heart rates at the day and your email your workouts and so on

548
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
I'm so it's actually

549
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,168
Is useful Durbin days are like

550
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,216
I think I'm okay to go do a long run

551
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:10,592
I left the wash my car so so I think I will rest up today

552
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
This is highly informal

553
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
But I think it'd be interesting

554
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,200
Is 2

555
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,480
Having now

556
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
Experiment with the body battery

557
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
A few weeks

558
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,808
I would like without you

559
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
Looking at your body battery

560
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,880
To guesstimate where it's

561
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,208
At the same point in time each day right guesstimate where it's at

562
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
And write that down and

563
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
Then check it

564
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
See how

565
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,096
On point because I'm curious like

566
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,888
You may feel awesome and it's like

567
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,960
So do you want to do that

568
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,264
I can do that and in fact

569
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,336
Before I had this feature I would just go off of my

570
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
Feel-Rite

571
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,968
And they were times when I felt great and I go say I'm going to go do an 8 Mile

572
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
Loop over around the

573
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,040
On the trail near my house

574
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
And yet

575
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,416
I get two or three into it and like what was I thinking today my body is not responding well

576
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Right so it's

577
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
Butts

578
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
Experiment of one

579
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
And if anyone else has anything like

580
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,656
Just because

581
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
Sometimes I worry that

582
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
Their influence

583
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Computers

584
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,312
You're trusting the algorithm for sure

585
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,688
Yeah without a doubt put Garmin and polar I've used both their devices before I still have

586
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,456
Stop order

587
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
Smartwatch

588
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,040
They've been working towards this with different

589
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
Indices in

590
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,624
And such a to be honest

591
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
I

592
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
Fuel

593
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,720
Just for my experience that there

594
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
Worth trusting

595
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,792
Interesting algorithms

596
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
For those of us with a

597
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,472
How to say who are too lazy to clean their house but really this is for anyone

598
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,520
Google Assistant Canal support

599
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
Control robot mop

600
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,360
They could control Roomba vacuums for

601
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
A while

602
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,408
Yeah but

603
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:53,248
Is a way for developers to add support to the smart mop that are out there

604
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:57,088
Aaron boster iRobot makes some of those and others do as well

605
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,648
So what Google has done is basically

606
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:04,768
Extended what the vacuum class was for for developers to make skills and such

607
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,840
Tamara has a mop device type so

608
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,704
I don't have one of these I was kind of wish I did but

609
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,984
Stop tickling very well

610
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,544
I'm sure they're better now but the last one I tested it

611
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
It's not on

612
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,872
But that was like the first generation brother

613
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,992
You could have come a long way by now

614
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
All right

615
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
So

616
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,088
It feels like we're at that moment in our show

617
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
When it is time

618
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,280
It is time for the iot podcast hotline

619
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:43,168
What's the fifth largest coyote pad portfolio with a world of pharaoh provides a proven iot platform that doesn't risk

620
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
Your brand

621
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:50,336
A pharaoh customers have experienced as much as an 80% reduction in time-to-market and tenex higher activation

622
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,896
Should learn more at a pharaoh

623
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176
Dot IO

624
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
All right

625
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,528
This month on the iot pipe

626
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,552
Hotline

627
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,368
If you call us at 512-2623

628
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,648
744

629
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,720
We are giving away a wise sensor pack

630
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
In camera

631
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,816
So yes you could buy this for 40 bucks but

632
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
You can also maybe when it

633
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,144
So I say give us a call and

634
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,424
Maybe we'll also answer your

635
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
I have a question

636
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,008
This week's question comes from

637
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
Bobby

638
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
Let's hear it

639
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,664
Hi my name is Bobby and my wife I just bought a house

640
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
And

641
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,992
I have many other questions to the other recommendations

642
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,784
Now is

643
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,320
Leak detector sensors

644
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
I was given a Honeywell lyric

645
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
I want

646
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,184
Free and like it that

647
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,232
Was looking at buying more

648
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,280
I was just

649
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
Turn signal recommendations

650
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
For other ones

651
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
Thoughts where the

652
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,912
Samsung SmartThings

653
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:51,520
But I didn't know if there was any other Leak Detectors that you guys recommended

654
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
Thank you very much

655
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:59,968
I was so excited because you have already in your hot little hands

656
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,504
My favorite lie detector

657
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
Which is kind of expensive

658
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
But the Honeywell

659
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,648
Lyric Wi-Fi water leak and freeze detector is

660
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,768
Power device and I liked it so much because it's accurate but it's also got this long

661
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Entail

662
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,328
The wraps around pipes

663
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
It detects

664
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,144
They said leaks and fries

665
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,472
And I think it's just so much more effective than waiting for like a

666
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
Puddles

667
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
Reach ascensor

668
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,848
So it feels like you get more coverage

669
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,432
But it does come at a price and that price is 80 bucks for that

670
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
Which is

671
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
A lot

672
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
And it only works with the

673
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,088
Echo ecosystem it does not work

674
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
Assistant

675
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,696
So that is the one you already have

676
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,072
I'm going to recommend if you are hardcore interested in leak detection

677
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,632
To go with one of the smart

678
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
Home

679
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
Whole-home leak

680
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Detection model

681
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
They are

682
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Receita

683
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,568
The cheaper one is the flow

684
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,128
Buy Moen that is a $500 device

685
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,408
What you do

686
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
Yeah but

687
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,736
What it does is

688
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,320
It measures the water flowing through your pipes and uses an algorithm

689
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
To detect

690
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,720
Changes in water pressure it will detect not just like catastrophic

691
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:18,304
At least it'll also detect slow leaks or things like a toilet

692
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,584
Flapper the

693
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
Not secure not

694
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,656
Not slapping

695
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,472
I don't know how to describe it

696
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
You got to replace

697
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,800
The flapper if you hear the water running all the time and actually

698
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,336
Uses a lot of water

699
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Who knew

700
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,432
And this is awesome because it automatically turns off

701
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
So

702
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
Is it expensive

703
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
Yes

704
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,320
Is it possible you might get a discount from your insurance

705
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
Baby

706
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,880
But it's like

707
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:49,792
No but the key differences is not just a detector it can actually shut the water off and you're not going to find

708
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,120
That was just a sensor let me know lots of sensors that will

709
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
To detection

710
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,216
If you're not home and a detective

711
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,008
Bass Pro

712
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,848
So the other option in this category is

713
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,944
It's the same thing this actually needs a plumber to install it the other one does too

714
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,992
When you're messing with your water main you should

715
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
Recommendation

716
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,856
The thing is $700

717
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:18,464
It is a company that was spun out of Belkin it also was created in partnership with

718
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,256
Plumbing company called uponor

719
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
So

720
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
It's

721
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
Pricier

722
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
It has

723
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,424
Quality Brands behind it I've never tested

724
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,472
Any of these devices because

725
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,056
Well because now I've moved into a rental house and beforehand

726
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:37,152
They weren't actually ready for testing so these are relatively new

727
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
But

728
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Don't know how you feel.

729
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,272
What about the buoy folks

730
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:47,648
Oh yes because you're already the Honeywell ecosystem earlier this year because March

731
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,184
How do you spell actually

732
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,000
It's no longer honey that's resideo is be smart home

733
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
Company

734
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,328
It's behind the Smart Home

735
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
Honeywell gear

736
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,192
Securus still Honeywell the company making it now is called resideo

737
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,264
So resideo bought Bowie

738
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,080
Which was an MIT lab space company that also made

739
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
A whole home.

740
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Vice

741
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Now

742
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,200
It is unclear exactly what huh

743
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,552
That they talked about making their sensor leak detection system smarter

744
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
But

745
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,624
You cannot buy the buoy system

746
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
So

747
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
I don't know what to tell you

748
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512
Right

749
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:29,888
Venusaur is other non whole-home options I mean there's there's a number on the market that are probably less

750
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
Expensive in the lyric

751
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,472
Yes but we're really flogging a whole-home real

752
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:39,360
So if you want to do it right and have a budget for it I think that's the way to go

753
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,920
But if not I know you can do it for a lot less

754
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:45,248
You just want to look for ones like the lyric that have

755
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,808
Extendable cable to

756
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,368
Improve your coverage of leak detection

757
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
So

758
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,976
One option that also has an extendable sensor cable

759
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,792
A freezing Rod what

760
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
Accenture coverage

761
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
Is the D-Link

762
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,632
WiFi water

763
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,472
It's a little cheaper it's 60 bucks from D-Link as a

764
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,752
Close to the 80 bucks for

765
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
Honeywell version

766
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,312
It's also Wi-Fi

767
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
And

768
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,384
Performs the same function

769
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
I can't remember if I've tried this or no

770
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,760
But with this one it doesn't have an integrated siren

771
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,296
In the Honeywell

772
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
Definitely

773
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,600
That is because you have to like

774
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,416
Disconnected taxes stop the siren

775
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
Listen to my problems

776
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,000
This is kind of

777
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
But

778
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,048
Really useful

779
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,328
When there's actually

780
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,352
Your house

781
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,960
Let's find when you're testing and leaking things left and right but really good when

782
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
There's actually

783
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,032
Those are options there's also

784
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:44,384
Without the cable unit for 20 bucks you can get a Samsung SmartThings water leak

785
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,176
Detection sensor that you just Stickney

786
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,712
Troublesome spot

787
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,784
Grandma just has contacts on the bottom of it

788
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,576
Not any cable dirty like that

789
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,368
So in there in there several of those

790
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,160
I mean tons of companies make out

791
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:02,304
If you buy one of those a lot of them are cheaper because they use as a BRZ Wave radio

792
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
And you're going to need a hug

793
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
So just bear that in mind if

794
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,936
But their battery life will be amazing

795
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,496
Has to actually be

796
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
So

797
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
Keypad

798
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
Lots of options

799
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,640
Many options

800
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,456
For my money if I were doing it all over again

801
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,272
I would probably do the Smart Home

802
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:27,392
Whole home detection but I would also before I buy it call my insurance company and be like

803
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416
Hi

804
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,720
Is there a way to get a discount if I do this

805
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
All right

806
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,120
That hopefully answers your question Bobby or gives you

807
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,144
A lot of options in

808
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
You might be overwhelmed by them that we're sorry

809
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:45,056
Kiefer hauling and everyone else please give us a call five one two

810
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:49,152
623-7424 and you will be entered to win

811
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
DIYs sensor pack

812
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
Camera

813
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
All right

814
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,320
Now I would love for everyone to stay tuned

815
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856
For our guest

816
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
Who is, destem

817
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,928
The CEO of Monarch bio

818
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,000
She is going to be talking about how we can

819
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:08,352
It's actually relevant to what we talked about earlier because she's talking about how we can certify

820
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,400
Wellness and medical devices

821
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
Is accurate

822
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,984
So these algorithms that were relying on like

823
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
Body battery

824
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,312
They would actually look at that and see

825
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,616
How accurate is Porsche in a peer-reviewed

826
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,688
So she's going to talk about why we need that

827
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,736
The future of medicine and a lot more

828
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Stay tuned for her

829
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
The first

830
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,088
IMessage from this we sponsor

831
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,648
Dell Technologies

832
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:38,048
Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this we sponsor

833
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:44,448
Is Dell Technologies and I have Jason Sheppard who is CTO of iot and Edge adult

834
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,216
Technology

835
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
So json

836
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:50,336
Must we talk about Dell Technologies efforts it was around Edge X Foundry

837
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,688
So let's start off with an update about where that is and why it's so important

838
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:59,040
And we took a look at the market actually back in 2015 and

839
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,600
We're looking at all the platforms that were proliferating

840
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
And saw this problem

841
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:08,512
You're shaping where there was this need to have more flexibility and how Solutions were deployed taking the

842
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,072
Cloud native principles at UC

843
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:18,752
Cloud architectures in extending them to the edge where you have the ability to kind of rapidly deploy different functions around

844
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
You're going to common element

845
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,872
Ajax for iot as what what Android did for mobile

846
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,408
Anybody to create a Marketplace

847
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,688
Commercial value add

848
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:31,296
Around just enough in terms of open apis to bind together all the inherently

849
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
Heterogeneous

850
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,464
Components within iot we architect that it based on feedback from a bunch of Partners and customers then put it into the underneath

851
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,536
Open source as a project

852
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,584
That was the initial goal

853
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
Come up with the right architecture

854
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Collaborate

855
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:49,216
Neutral open sores and then once it gets going

856
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,496
Then you use that

857
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
As a vehicle to create

858
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,824
Commercial value-add on top of it

859
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,176
Can you imagine the internet without opening our ability to Ajax is really about creating that open

860
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,712
Baseline that then you can

861
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
Start building value

862
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
Without Reinventing the wheel

863
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Excellent

864
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,624
All right so what is Dell strategy with Ajax

865
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,952
And how does that relate to your openedge stack

866
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,000
Yes our strategy is

867
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
Get that going but no

868
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,328
Foundationally we're about

869
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:21,472
Creating consistent infrastructure I always say we build the guts or Partners can bring the glory we want that's open ecosystem

870
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,520
Attached to that so that you can bend

871
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
Scale-out

872
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
Relationships

873
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,848
You can have special breed solution

874
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:31,200
Come together around a common core you will attach our Security Management tools

875
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:37,600
You can use them stand alone but menus with Ajax and them safe ati's you get the benefit

876
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:41,952
Defender neutral ecosystem

877
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,232
So what is the status

878
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,000
Imagix

879
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,328
We're going one now though it's going commercial

880
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,656
Yeah there's actually companies that are basing business models around

881
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:57,056
You a jacksepticeye attack as an example is a company that's creating a redbad model around offering commercially supported

882
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:03,456
Versions of it then you have companies like redis redis Edge is a database optimized for time series data but then they saw

883
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,504
That's also got support for tensorflow

884
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,552
Analytics Dave made a decision token

885
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
How to plug into a TV

886
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:15,232
Replace the existing database in there what's credits if you'd like what Pros out there publicly talking about using Ajax there's a

887
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:20,352
Initiative sponsored by Intel

888
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,376
Downloader

889
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,960
Going up very quickly of April it was 2500 downloads

890
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:30,336
You're made 4500 a miniature starting a ramp so we're definitely seeing that ramp it out in the market

891
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:34,688
Excellent and where can we go to find out more about Dell Technologies

892
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
And the open Edge

893
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,552
Dell Technologies. Com coyote

894
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,880
A good starting point and then there's been some links off of there to go learn more

895
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:54,912
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

896
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,448
And today's guest is

897
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,288
Comedy stem who is CEO and founder at

898
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,824
Monarc bionetworks

899
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,128
Hi, how are you doing

900
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,176
Great thanks for having me sleepy

901
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,760
Oh I'm really excited because we're going to talk about one of my favorite

902
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,344
Topics which is this concept of digital snake oil

903
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,880
And the idea that we have

904
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:19,232
All of these companies and devices that are coming onto the market that

905
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
Say

906
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,816
Hey I'm going to make your life better make you healthier

907
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:27,168
As consumers we really don't have a sense of how accurate any of these are and

908
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,496
We don't understand what your doctor may not want her Fitbit

909
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
Random

910
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,800
Other data from

911
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,592
Connected mattress or something

912
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,152
So you're going to tell us a little bit about

913
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,688
Why things are the way they are

914
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,248
So let's first get started with

915
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,784
Your background because

916
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,088
It ties directly into why you founded

917
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,184
I think they see what I actually am

918
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,280
I'm from the pharmaceutical backgrounds I have been a clinical researcher

919
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:58,400
Story about 20-plus years across multiple pharmaceutical companies and Ivory

920
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,752
Actually execute clinical trials for the development of new treatments

921
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,592
And about

922
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:11,200
6 years ago I started heading up an Innovations need to figure out how could we actually

923
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,552
They make up a good 70

924
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,904
Billion dollars

925
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,024
And as I was doing this I realize that you know what

926
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,584
We do in clinical trials as we generate

927
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,984
And to ensure the safety and efficacy of a drug that goes out on the market

928
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,752
Realizes that we

929
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,056
Haley

930
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
Generated

931
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
In the clinic

932
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,152
And all of these new wearable

933
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:47,040
Sensors that are coming out the possibility of collecting data in between the clinic

934
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:53,440
Which is completely new set of data that we've never had before that could really help us understand how

935
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Outpatient

936
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,232
Arguing

937
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,560
In between clinic visits in the context of Their Own

938
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
Look at me really

939
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,120
Excited about

940
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:04,704
The internet of things and all the devices but I also think

941
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
It's really important

942
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,520
Just having a lot of data

943
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,312
You actually have to

944
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,616
Transform it into evidence

945
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,664
But you can trust and that can

946
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,968
Julian form

947
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,016
Research and treatment of new drug

948
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,552
But also how it can

949
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,600
Influence

950
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,648
Do you use your health care is provided

951
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:28,768
So that's a super tall order let's start there cuz that seems like

952
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,304
The core of the issue

953
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,352
It sounds like it's a mix of

954
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,144
Hey is this device

955
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,936
Reliable and accurate

956
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,704
Consistent

957
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,008
Play probably across a bunch of populations

958
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,800
And then the other is

959
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,104
Is this device actually useful it

960
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,408
Detecting or monitoring a specific

961
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
Disease

962
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,224
That I don't know if there's another site

963
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
This is there

964
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,064
What what starts with devices

965
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,928
Cuz I think that's a good way to start and maybe we can use

966
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,512
Is we create t-shirt

967
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,864
Communities of people that have a condition and

968
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,144
Interested in

969
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
Contributing their data

970
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,496
And pulling it together to give better

971
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
Insight for me

972
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,360
So we started a network in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

973
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,896
And in ITF

974
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:20,224
The way they measure progression

975
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784
A pulmonary function

976
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,392
Anthem company is that is divided

977
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,952
A parameter which is what measure is your

978
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,792
Pasadena

979
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,584
Bear

980
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,888
Manufacturers that develop devices that could

981
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,424
Actually measure that in the

982
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Howdy

983
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:48,128
What does FDA cleared 510 K clearance they call it and basically

984
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
How do you put that

985
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
Device

986
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:55,296
Consistently measure a person's lung function in the home

987
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,344
That's all it tells you how do you use

988
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,368
How do you

989
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,648
How do you know that

990
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
Really important

991
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,488
We integrate

992
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
That is

993
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
Trial

994
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,096
And we said we want to know

995
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
Who is

996
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
Patience can actually

997
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,192
Recently uses device

998
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
Accurately

999
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,800
A measurement that they take from the device

1000
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,336
And the measurement of

1001
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,640
Using an in-clinic

1002
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,944
So I think that's really important

1003
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,784
To make sure that we're doing trials and research to validate

1004
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,832
Not that the device work for that it

1005
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,880
Actually works in the context in which it

1006
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
Going to be

1007
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:35,232
Because these things will be used to inform decisions

1008
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,256
And it's not

1009
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,280
The same as he

1010
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,328
Directions

1011
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,144
Didn't quite work

1012
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
Clinical decision on

1013
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,960
Treatment

1014
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
It really hurts

1015
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
What's really important

1016
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
That we validate

1017
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,872
We integrated that device

1018
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:56,479
To the trial and we measure the patient using the spirometer from the home

1019
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,039
As well as he measured that data or week

1020
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,063
Compared that data

1021
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,111
The data that we generated in

1022
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,159
And look for a strong correlation

1023
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,951
Okay this is interesting

1024
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
Because

1025
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,791
A spirometer is actually a tool that has been

1026
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
Used for

1027
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,839
Forever

1028
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:17,727
But this is an established medical device so the only new thing here was connecting it and I'm making sure that

1029
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,031
Patients could use it accurately

1030
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
In the home

1031
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
Correct

1032
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,383
Another aspect of it

1033
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,151
Infinite

1034
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,711
Spirometers I'm you have to do a lot of calibration

1035
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,807
So even in clinical trials when I've used in clinics

1036
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,695
Providence actually calibrate

1037
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:42,815
And then the patient immediately

1038
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
Don't give them Direct

1039
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,167
Feedback whether they use the device right and then the data gets

1040
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
Awesome

1041
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,079
Savannah is very different than me sayings

1042
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:58,943
One of my products that I really think it would be perfect for iot in the home in for medicine

1043
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,991
Would be like a device were

1044
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,783
When my child has

1045
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,551
Cost

1046
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,599
I could have her coffin to my

1047
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,159
Amazon Echo for example and have

1048
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,951
The AI on the device say

1049
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,719
Oh

1050
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:14,047
Is totally something you should go to the doctor right away or that sounds like

1051
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,071
The common cold

1052
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
Don't stress Jesse

1053
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,143
I lived in fear of my daughter getting

1054
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
Terrifying

1055
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
But I'm a little weird

1056
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:30,175
So what happens if you have an entirely new device that maybe isn't a medical device or if you want to bring some

1057
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:34,271
Something like a common wearable or an Amazon Echo or something else

1058
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,295
Into

1059
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,575
Netty clinical testing

1060
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,135
What my thought process look like or what needs to have

1061
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,951
Or maybe it won't happen at all cuz that's crazy

1062
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:48,863
No no no it's really important actually we're starting to introduce more of these devices into clinical trial

1063
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,447
Because the reality is more more

1064
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,751
Then bringing it into the doctor and saying

1065
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
So what do you think of this data

1066
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,199
Clinical trials

1067
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,759
My experience has been right

1068
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,807
Future right now

1069
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:12,159
We need to start introducing devices and doing research

1070
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,207
In the same way that Keras

1071
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,047
An example of how we what I've previously done in

1072
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,375
Introducing somebody's wearable so for example we had to study

1073
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,143
For hemophilia

1074
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:27,519
But one of the challenges with haemophilia is people accommodate to their disease

1075
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
Afraid they're going to get

1076
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,591
Bleed for this

1077
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,615
Moving around alot

1078
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,967
Activities and so forth and so way to measure the

1079
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:41,087
The impact on the quality of life typically what we've done is me to ask questions

1080
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,951
These are very no they're not very objective

1081
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,999
Subjective what the patient might be

1082
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,655
Their activity very possibly

1083
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,423
Remind

1084
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,727
Tasty and we actually did see a difference

1085
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,007
Impatient

1086
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,055
They took the treatment and they had left

1087
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
Bleed

1088
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,871
They became more confident

1089
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,407
Actually became more active

1090
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,687
The Weeknd

1091
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,735
Actively measure now

1092
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,783
That impact outside of the

1093
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
In their daily life

1094
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
That's a powerful way to

1095
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
Did you

1096
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:19,743
That is awesome and so when you were doing that how did you have to

1097
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,535
I guess evaluate the Fitbit

1098
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,303
4

1099
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,839
Was it an actual Fitbit or what

1100
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,631
Was it something else

1101
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,167
When did the variety

1102
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,263
I think it's a matter of

1103
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,823
Visioning what you want

1104
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,359
If you need

1105
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,663
Really precise measurement

1106
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:41,247
Often times what you'll do with your pride of validate

1107
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,063
The measurement in an earlier trial for that

1108
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,343
You can use it in a

1109
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,975
Registration trial for example

1110
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,535
But if you wanted to

1111
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,631
So just depends on what the is it a primary endpoint of the secondary

1112
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,191
War of the

1113
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,727
Impact and quality of life

1114
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,519
Singer going to use that data to

1115
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
Discussion

1116
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,359
Around getting reimbursed for that drug

1117
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,895
Because it has a Major Impact

1118
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:14,015
On the quality of life of a patient and their productivity depends on how you're going to use it

1119
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,551
As to what grade

1120
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,367
When you go to different devices

1121
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,671
Tuesday

1122
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:24,255
Babe I'm developing something where I'm going to encourage my

1123
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
Inition

1124
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
2

1125
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
Monitor Act

1126
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:30,655
Cavity in the patient and you want them to not have to go by

1127
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,423
Xiaomi devices

1128
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,983
You want to use something as commercially available

1129
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,263
A commonly used

1130
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,543
Kind of depends

1131
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,335
That makes a lot of sense

1132
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:42,431
Imagine you could cut costs and boost participation if you had something like

1133
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,199
Hey

1134
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,991
If you have an Apple Watch or Fitbit

1135
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
You're wearing what I need

1136
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
So

1137
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,599
Exactly

1138
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,879
And that broadens act

1139
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,439
Participate in the trial

1140
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:58,559
Which gives more diversity of patients which that makes the data more generalized

1141
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
Market

1142
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,887
Although then we have to deal with like complying

1143
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:05,983
Tissues cuz I can't be the only person who's been dissatisfied with their step count

1144
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,031
10 digit off to their kid to be like

1145
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,055
Hey

1146
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,079
Take this for a while

1147
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,615
I know I'm only lying to me

1148
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,175
But is that something people

1149
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,991
About when they're thinking about

1150
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,527
Medical testing

1151
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,135
Absolutely looking at compliance and adherence

1152
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,671
Remembering

1153
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,975
Clinical research and clinical trials

1154
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:30,559
More compliance in that than they are in the real world

1155
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,863
Staying face to figure out okay

1156
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,143
This is the level of

1157
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
Science Theater

1158
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,215
In the trial will be achieved

1159
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,239
Same level

1160
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,799
In the real world and that's why it's really important

1161
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,103
Even after we do these trials

1162
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,895
But we continue trial

1163
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,943
Do things

1164
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,247
I need a bring your own device

1165
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,783
Wearable

1166
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:54,879
Because then we really understand what happens in the context

1167
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,207
All right so you had mentioned earlier

1168
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,767
That clinical trials are kind of

1169
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,047
The future of Medicine

1170
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:08,703
Where were heading so I am curious with what you're doing today

1171
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:12,287
Clinical trials where do you think the future of medicine is heading

1172
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:16,127
At Monarch her vision is that research is integrated into

1173
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:16,895
I could care

1174
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,175
And that we have a

1175
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:22,271
Early Learning health systems Dynamic and adopt

1176
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,807
So you're not we

1177
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:27,903
Have a visit with your doctor you're generating data and

1178
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,695
Informing you

1179
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:33,535
In that same way but constantly integrating Research into care

1180
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:38,399
Then when learning very quickly and you Solutions are being adopted very quickly

1181
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,959
So to give you an example

1182
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,239
When you

1183
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,519
Medical

1184
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,543
Device

1185
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,103
Is approved

1186
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,639
It's hate another

1187
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:52,479
7 years or to actually be adopted in integrated

1188
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,807
Unbelievable right

1189
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,111
There is a huge guy

1190
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,927
Between when something isn't approved

1191
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
An integrated is

1192
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,255
Hair We imagine a world

1193
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,791
Where is your console

1194
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,351
Silly integrating Research into care

1195
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,935
Then you're going to be able to accelerate that adoption

1196
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
Inhibition

1197
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:18,335
More and more clinical decisions will be very data-driven

1198
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
Because

1199
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:23,455
It's almost like every decision you're making as a trial of Anna

1200
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,015
Because you've got so much data and your

1201
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,551
And as we get two more

1202
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,831
Personalized

1203
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,111
And customized

1204
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,135
Madison

1205
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,183
That's the way we need to operate

1206
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,231
I like it alright so

1207
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,279
If we're moving towards this world

1208
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,887
I know that we've been talking about what you call is regulatory grade evidence

1209
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,191
But what else do we need it feels like

1210
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:47,007
We might need our physicians to

1211
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,543
To change a little bit

1212
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,359
I don't know if there's much we can do his patients but

1213
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,383
Tell me

1214
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,151
Where the hoes

1215
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:58,271
Well I think it's huge huge hole that we have right now is

1216
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,319
With what major in

1217
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,599
Across the US

1218
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,695
Is digitizing all of our health records and there's been a lot of work

1219
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:08,511
All of that Digital Data is

1220
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
Sitting in silos

1221
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,583
It's really important

1222
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,119
In order for

1223
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,167
Really GATRA bus evidence

1224
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:19,519
We need to get larger pool the data and people need to share their

1225
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,543
In a way that

1226
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:24,127
For the greater good and we have to figure out how do we do that

1227
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,711
Client way so that side to see isn't walk

1228
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,991
As well as

1229
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:32,575
That we we can have Innovations on top of that the

1230
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:39,743
Spell is not the it I think we have to get over the river hold the date

1231
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:42,303
Do with that data that makes the difference

1232
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,327
We need to

1233
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,143
Owning data to accessing data

1234
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,423
And sharing data

1235
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,215
So I think this is

1236
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:49,983
Awesome

1237
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,055
Except I read a story probably

1238
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:57,919
Probably a couple months back about it was a CPAP machine that ensures or paying for

1239
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
And

1240
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:02,271
Ensures were gathering data for these connectors at machines

1241
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,855
And they were looking to see if the patients were actually using it

1242
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,135
And if they weren't

1243
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:07,903
They work

1244
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,975
Cutting off insurance payments for the CPAP machine rental

1245
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,767
In one hand I get it

1246
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,071
You don't want to pay for something that someone's night

1247
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
Using

1248
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:20,959
But on the other hand the patients didn't actually realize this was happening nor did their doctors

1249
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,751
And so I think

1250
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,799
It's good to talk about privacy

1251
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,871
It's even better to talk about in the context of

1252
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:33,247
How we're going to pay for things and how who's going to have access to data

1253
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,015
Not just

1254
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,319
To build a business but even to make kind of

1255
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,599
Care decisions

1256
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,623
I don't know if

1257
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,671
Got any ideas around this but

1258
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Feel like

1259
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:44,255
Feel like we've got to do something before we start implementing

1260
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,279
Too much data

1261
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,303
Into the medical Realm

1262
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,143
I see it's really important

1263
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:55,519
Uber transparent on who has access to the data

1264
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:04,735
Can you use an interesting example cuz my mother actually using the CPAP machine

1265
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,271
And she's well aware

1266
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
That

1267
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:07,807
She doesn't

1268
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:14,463
Benefits get removed or reduced or whatever

1269
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,559
I put it on for a minimum of 5 hours and then I take it off

1270
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:25,215
I like my teacher that is so that you know you don't you don't get hurt

1271
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,495
But anyway

1272
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,799
Commission using it for those for 5 hours

1273
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,127
Got their measure

1274
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,015
Be more accurate than I think she would have

1275
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,575
I don't disagree with you that you have

1276
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:46,975
There needs to be transparency there needs to be understanding

1277
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,279
That's happening as a result of

1278
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,143
That's fair cuz in some cases like I might have no problem

1279
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:57,215
Donating my blood testator

1280
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,775
Echocardiograms or whatever data that might be interesting

1281
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:00,799
Josiah

1282
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:04,127
I might say yeah I totally want you to have this data for research

1283
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,407
But I would be

1284
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:11,807
Considerably at giving that data to an insurance firm or navy to my Corporation

1285
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,343
As part of a Wellness Plan

1286
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,135
I think the raw data

1287
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,927
Is something that it's not

1288
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,719
It should be protected because

1289
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:21,023
This kind of data can be used to infer some

1290
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:27,935
Crazy things in overtime will make more correlations and we will be able to infer a lot more from that day.

1291
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
End

1292
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:32,031
I don't think there's a way to put that Genie back in the bottle once it's out

1293
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:37,663
Yeah I would agree with you and I think you know if we just be really careful

1294
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,455
When did Jada goes in 18

1295
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:45,087
Verde.

1296
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,879
Should have the right to deter

1297
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:53,279
Hammond where it goes what's interesting is when you're really sick with a life-threatening or chronic debilitating

1298
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,071
You're more than willing

1299
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,863
Archer view that data

1300
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,911
1G distillate in Hope

1301
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:03,519
Start a treatment will be developed for yourself or for your your children

1302
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,591
You just that you had really great care

1303
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,615
A lot of people would say

1304
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,895
I had really great

1305
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,711
I'm going to donate a bunch of money

1306
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:29,119
And what about doctors and medical professionals because I know that I come to my daughter and I'll be like here's my

1307
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,399
My data is there like

1308
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,679
Please take it out of my

1309
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,703
My face I don't want it

1310
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,007
How do we get there

1311
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:39,359
Clinically validated but how do we get there

1312
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:43,967
And give them the tools to actually be able to use this information in providing care

1313
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,759
Yeah

1314
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:51,135
Synthesizing for research is really important because peer-reviewed validated

1315
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,719
Sources of information right now or peer review.

1316
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,119
That the way to

1317
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,655
Delivered the information

1318
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:06,239
Time in a way that there YouTube

1319
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,567
They're super busy overworked and when

1320
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,871
Come in with a dataset they're not

1321
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,943
Many of them want to

1322
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,735
But

1323
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,759
They don't have

1324
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,087
What time is the currency that we have to figure out

1325
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,903
Is an increased by the

1326
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,183
Introduction

1327
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,999
Starting those are two important things to think about is

1328
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:32,351
Looking forward delivery evidence through publication vincere review

1329
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,679
Into that it's integrated into workflow

1330
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
Awesome

1331
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:37,727
All right

1332
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:41,567
Thank you so much for coming on the show today I feel like

1333
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,359
I've learned a lot and I'm actually

1334
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,151
Cautiously optimistic about

1335
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,687
Advancing Medical Care

1336
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:50,271
Incredible

1337
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:57,695
With both technology and medicine and patients themselves being more empowered to be part of the

1338
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,999
Definition

1339
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:06,399
