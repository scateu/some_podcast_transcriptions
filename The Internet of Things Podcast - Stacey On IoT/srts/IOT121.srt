00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,776
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:15,360
This is your house Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,664
Kevin tofel and we have

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,992
An awesome show for you we're going to get messy

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:21,760
Bluetooth

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,552
Which just announced their.

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,344
Mesh networking standard

8
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,904
We also got to talk about Google class baby it's

9
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,744
We got the Amazon echos features in an alarm clock

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,792
We've got a security

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,376
Got a big funding for an iot development platform

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,704
The FBI warning people about connected toys and some

13
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,520
Low-power wide area network

14
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,288
Action

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
And

16
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,848
Our Guest this week is

17
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:51,712
Can colder above the Bluetooth say we're going to get even deeper into what Bluetooth mesh

18
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,736
Memes for you

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,064
We also go to a message from our sponsor to discuss

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
Why you're connected locks

21
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
Don't always work with

22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648
With the Amazon

23
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,696
And now

24
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,720
Let's take a moment

25
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,512
For a message from another one of ours

26
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
Affiliated monitoring

27
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:13,216
If you're hunting for a subscription Revenue model for your iot business you need to hear about Affiliated monitoring

28
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,616
In response to a trigger from any connected device Affiliated to professionally trained live agents can follow

34
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,872
Additionally we hear the podcast our booking ads for

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
Before so

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968

00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,808
Andrew at iot podcast

39
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
DACA

40
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
Alright Kevin

41
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
Let's not going out

42
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,696
YouTube

43
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,536
Yeah we've been waiting for this for a while

44
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:14,656
Yeah yeah I know our guest from the Bluetooth Sig is going to really get into

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,216
The news here but just to

46
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,520
If you belie level Bluetooth

47
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,080
Will now support Mesh networking

48
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,384
Show Bluetooth devices instead of being

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,688
Peer-to-peer or one device to one

50
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,296
Prettymuch introduces many-to-many which is crazy

51
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
A good for

52
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,904
Oh geez I mean Smart Homes

53
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
Industrial industrial

54
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
Yeah this gets Bluetooth into the industrial world it's been

55
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
Excited about

56
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,888
The one thing we don't address

57
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
In

58
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Interview

59
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
Is

60
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
What is this mean for Olive

61
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
The other stand

62
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,824
So stay tuned for all of the stuff about it

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,872
Things called mesh models we talked about

64
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,920
How it does intelligent routing

65
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
We talked about

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,760
Use cases and will even talk about things like

67
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
IPv6 a bandwidth since

68
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
So there is a lot

69
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
In the interview

70
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,976
Well I haven't heard the interview yet I'll hear it after the show

71
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:16,096
But so if you guys have talked about this that's so we can skip this but I'm curious about the

72
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:22,496
Power requirements I'm curious about if this will require new Bluetooth Hardware devices which I don't think it will I think it

73
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
Will actually work with

74
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,568
Bluetooth 4 and 5 devices

75
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
Better already exist

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
So am I correct in that

77
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
Kevin you're spoiling the interview

78
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
Yes you are correct

79
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,272
So it's only going to work over Bluetooth low energy

80
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,576
He's not going to work over classic

81
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
What else did you want

82
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,184
Power I'm curious about any power

83
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,560
So we get into how it conserves power that's actually a huge portion of the interview

84
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
And then

85
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,448
When it comes to how it's going to be implemented

86
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,496
That really depends on

87
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Yourself

88
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,616
So it goes all the way back to Bluetooth LE 4.

89
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,408
So it's backwards compatible

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,480
Provided your silicon provider update their chip

91
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
With the software needed to R

92
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
Gotcha

93
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,952
Okay okay well those are two key questions I was curious about before we actually answered the question you originally asked which is

94
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
What does this mean for

95
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
Other Technologies because

96
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,095
When I saw this news hit was the first thing I thought of and

97
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
I may be wrong I'll let you tell me

98
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:27,775
But I merely thought of Z-Wave because he waited always had National working as far as I can remember

99
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
And

100
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
What so happen to Z-Wave

101
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,943
So there's three Mesh networking technologies that matter in

102
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
The Smart Home

103
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
Lesso the industrial

104
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
Definitely the smart

105
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
Zippy

106
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
Z-Wave

107
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
And

108
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,071
I feel like Z-Wave is a little bit on the outs in talking to people

109
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
You have seen things like Eero supporting

110
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
Thread in their routers

111
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,727
Comcast is actually supporting

112
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,311
Thread in some of its Xfinity home gateways

113
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,103
So I look

114
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
If that is

115
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
Part of that so I'm like

116
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
Yeah I know

117
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:14,111
For the longest time I was at on-site anti Z-Wave and not against any technology that solves a problem effectively

118
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,463
But I've never felt confident of Z-Wave would come out as a

119
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
A leader

120
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
In the space

121
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,583
Just because mainly because I should say

122
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:30,239
It's not as prevalent in devices and by devices I mean the phones and tablets and things that people use to control

123
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
Other things

124
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,591
With all those devices have Wi-Fi all in my Bluetooth

125
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,919
And the Bluetooth was lacking match so does he weigh

126
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
I started warming up to it

127
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:44,063
But now that Bluetooth has mesh it's almost like that whole Advantage is negated to me

128
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
Right and I think honestly

129
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
A bigger

130
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,719
Question would be what is this due to sick because he pees really popular

131
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
In lighting

132
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
It is the radio protocol behind like

133
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,863
Your Hue Lights and a lot of other

134
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
Even industrial lighting

135
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
Thanks

136
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
It is a mesh Network

137
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,495
Work as well as a low-power mission

138
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
And

139
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
Bluetooth is coming

140
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,639
That's where we stand right here

141
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:14,271
Any advantage Bluetooth is going to have here is that it's in all these phones and other devices

142
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Today

143
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
If they can be updated

144
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
And many of them can be

145
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,159
Then you're going to see

146
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
If you're in an industrial setting

147
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,743
Probably actually won't

148
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
Control lot of stuff

149
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
From your phone

150
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
Rihanna Stay

151
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
But

152
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,655
There might be an advantage to having someone

153
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
Contribute

154
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Using their phone

155
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
I can see cases where

156
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
Hpac system

157
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
Someone could be like hey

158
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,479
They're still I'm not writing any of these other Technologies off by any means

159
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,783
Because I think there's still some advantages

160
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,855
I know the zigbee is really low power I I don't

161
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
You know about

162
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,719
I'm sorry Z-Wave I was thinking cuz I looked it up earlier this morning

163
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
I'm so there may be power advantages

164
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
To have

165
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
AZ wave

166
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Chip inside

167
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,727
But that's not necessarily a bad thing that is

168
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,311
Doesn't necessarily a bad thing because not every application needs

169
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
You know lots of megabits

170
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Is per second

171
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Trooper

172
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:19,039
And there may be some cost advantages in terms of the of the chips themselves it again like I haven't seen any compare

173
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
So I'm not writing it off yet

174
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
I just

175
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
That's kind of where my head's at right now

176
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,975
I think it will remain to be seen

177
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Honestly

178
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
Bluetooth is going to

179
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
Conquer all

180
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863
Just because

181
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,423
This is still very new

182
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,007
There's still a lot of unanswered questions even in the current spec

183
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
About how it handles some of the

184
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103
Routing requirements and scalability requirements

185
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
I think it about

186
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,223
5 months maybe 6 months will

187
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
Kind of start seeing how this is going

188
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
The industry

189
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
Actually think

190
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
The more interesting question

191
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
Is how does

192
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Bluetooth

193
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
Thread kind

194
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,999
Because one of the things Bluetooth doesn't do

195
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
And thread does to

196
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
You can talk directly to the internet

197
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Bluetooth

198
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
Could do that but it

199
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
Doesn't nimesh situations

200
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Won't

201
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
So

202
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,103
I'm kind of thinking about this and I'm like

203
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,735
I think this is an excellent technology

204
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,575
A lot of devices are already going to come out and support it

205
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Today

206
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
And

207
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:31,743
It will be awesome because like right now my Bluetooth switches for example

208
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
If I'm not on the same floor as the light

209
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
I can't control

210
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
Commensurate

211
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
That's just

212
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Cell

213
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
We shall see

214
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,263
Let us move on to other

215
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
Exciting news

216
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
Google Glass

217
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,919
Google class which is also Bluetooth capable

218
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,759
Google glass cutter because I thought it was dead for

219
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
Good reason it was very

220
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
Consumer-focused

221
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,623
Google did the whole Explorer Thing 2

222
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,463
Early adopters Peyton want to pay $1,500 for

223
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
This

224
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:08,095
Camera and small processor and battery and sensors to

225
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
I didn't want to admit it but yeah

226
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,871
I still do an in a dresser drawer somewhere I have the original Google Glass

227
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
Edition Explorer Edition

228
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
Yes back when we work for a gigolo

229
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
Google home actually

230
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,599
Purchase that was for me to cover because we thought this could be very interesting space

231
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
And it is an interesting space

232
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,951
Suggested develop the way Google thought it would back in

233
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,511
I don't know 2013 or so

234
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:42,655
But quietly Google has continued to work on Google Glass for different type of customer

235
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,727
Mainly that is Enterprise and Industrial cuss

236
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
Mercy

237
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,543
They just announced that

238
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,615
Hey we've been doing this and it's actually working pretty well so

239
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,735
Companies such as GE Boeing DHL have all been using it doctors have been using it

240
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:02,623
DHL for example says that they've been dating Kris their supply chain efficiency by 15% where is

241
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,671
In healthcare it's reduced paperwork

242
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:11,071
Got loads by 20% and allows doctors spend more time with patients so so there is a glass Enterprise Edition that it's

243
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,887
Targeted towards I think the Right audience for that product

244
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
If your consumer nothing's really changed here but

245
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Amateur

246
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,823
The workforce that you want to enable with some type of AR

247
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,895
Or additional information that they

248
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,223
The glance of an I know it's it's pretty interesting stuff

249
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
Well so this

250
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,623
I think remember how computers personal computers started out in the workplace and migrated out

251
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
I think this idea of heads-up displays

252
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
Arso

253
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
Both high cost

254
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
Originally

255
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,583
It's a very big

256
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,887
Difference is a huge social

257
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
User interface ship

258
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,055
So I think starting at the Enterprise make sense for a

259
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
Don't think of this Justice

260
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:01,503
Glasses right they just heads up display and not having to look at a screen is really compelling

261
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,575
And this is technology that is

262
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,647
Floyd

263
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
It's also technology

264
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,975
Microsoft is using

265
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
With manufacturers

266
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
Using its hololens

267
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
That's Amore

268
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,703
One of the big questions I have about things like a r is

269
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Do I really want to look at

270
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
At the world through my phone

271
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Play now

272
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,615
I was shocked actually when Google launched these for consume

273
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
Cuz I was like

274
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,967
This is this going to violate all kinds of social contracts in

275
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,831
Did just what you did

276
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
But but but I think

277
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
The way I

278
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,231
Look at the product when it first launched for consumers was

279
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,559
Very much like I look at Android Wear and other

280
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Smart watches

281
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
That is

282
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,423
Contextual information at a glance

283
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,799
If you look at it that way it sort of makes sense unfortunate did much more than that such as recording people

284
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
A video and so on and

285
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
We know light indicator that people knew you were recording them

286
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,735
This Enterprise Edition actually does have a little light so that people are aware

287
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
So

288
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,807
I got it just was the wrong

289
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
Form for that concept

290
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
Yes and this has

291
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
Better networking

292
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,279
Faster better processor longer battery life

293
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,095
It's got a camera that's 8 megapixels

294
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
So

295
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Icing

296
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,775
In Enterprises are also going to be able to pay this price and then when we get economies of scale

297
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Come down

298
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,847
I was at the Snapchat glasses sold

299
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,407
No we don't I don't I don't

300
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
Exist

301
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,991
Elsa real quick just cuz you were mentioning some

302
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
Inspect I noticed that there's an Intel atom

303
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Inside witch

304
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
Surprise me

305
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,183
Yes yes because the original glass was kind of built

306
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
Apollon smartphone gots

307
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
Which made sense low power

308
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,583
But it was capable of doing what needed to be done

309
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,887
This actually has an Intel atom inside

310
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,239
Well in that might be because of software can a lot of enterprise software is an arm

311
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
I'm compatible yet

312
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
I don't know

313
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
And you know these guys

314
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,663
Presumably you can charge your glasses every night if you're in a workspace here

315
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,783
You don't think they take them home I employees use the method asking or on the

316
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,599
Production line or wherever they are doctors in the office

317
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
So you got it you know

318
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
As long as you can get

319
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
I don't even know a full 8 hours or baby

320
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,791
I mean if you're on a production line you probably have a

321
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Prescribed luncheon

322
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Probably charge

323
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Okay so that was exciting

324
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,751
I am stoked about the return of glass in what feels like

325
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
Immortal dragons

326
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Gradual rollout

327
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
Tell me about

328
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
This alarm

329
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Because it looks pretty

330
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,343
Yeah so that's a Kickstarter I say that right up front that has already exceeded its goal

331
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
So it is going to

332
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
Continue

333
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
It's the

334
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,255
Sandman Doppler and I had not heard of this

335
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:57,119
Sandman company before but apparently they came up with a guy Kickstarter or successful Kickstarter

336
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
Previously

337
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
Turn alarm clock like a Smart Alarm Clock

338
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
That did not have

339
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,055
The Voice services that Amazon Echo

340
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
Rides

341
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
I don't want to say miss a Disney and that's why I said it that way

342
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:13,759
I'm so this is kind of interesting to me it's it's literally an alarm clock that

343
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,319
When you look at the screen or the display

344
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,415
It looks like an old-time LED or I'm sorry LCD

345
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Alarm clock

346
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,535
But it has a pair of speakers I think 14 why so they probably

347
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Allowed

348
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:31,679
And it's got the boy Services built-in as quick buttons that you can program to do

349
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Cast

350
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,007
Instead of using your voice to say can you say

351
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,335
I think it's great miss a turn the lights out

352
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
In house

353
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,943
You can just program that to a button or several of those buttons

354
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,759
The screen display does show your your weather

355
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,807
Which is kind of nice the day of the week

356
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,367
It also has a little light bar which is customizable

357
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:55,999
To indicate certain things so you do you want to know if the stock market up or down you can program that light bar to psi

358
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Show green or red

359
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,631
Obviously it's got a microphone built-in so you can speak to it

360
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,447
And what I thought was really smart of these guys

361
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,775
They put in 6 USB ports in the back of it

362
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
So you can charge your

363
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
Mobile devices off of this thing

364
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
And even more interesting Lee

365
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:19,551
You can pull three of those out at a time and replace them to a different form factors have the old USB a

366
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
Words you can put those in it

367
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
USBC you can put those in

368
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,671
Really really clever design

369
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
It's been funded

370
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:30,303
It looks like it will not be available to backers for about a year

371
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,351
Unfortunately we're just kind of a bummer

372
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,959
But if you want one on the cheap you can beta test that you're not going to get final Hardware ever

373
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
Beta test

374
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,567
Hardware in design for $89

375
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
You can still get

376
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,687
Essendant Doppler for 119 in advance

377
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,735
Don't know if they said the

378
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
The MSRP

379
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
At this point they have a

380
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,599
Now I will say that feels

381
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
I got a.

382
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,951
Then it's great So for 50 bucks

383
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,279
I can tell it to do all these things so I'm sitting here wondering

384
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,327
You know having a clock display

385
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,631
Is nice in the middle of the night I'm not going to ask

386
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,495
It feels like a lot of money just to get additional

387
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Port Saint.

388
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
It's certainly going to sound better to

389
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
Okay well that's true okay

390
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,991
Yammy just has a pair of 14 watt speakers where is if I had to guess the.

391
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,599
You probably looking that more like us almost like a smartphone speaker week maybe two watsapp best

392
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,415
Oh and the quick access actually can do several

393
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
Thanks it's not just one thing

394
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,743
Okay so

395
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,023
Basically I don't

396
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Dubai another device

397
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
You're really get it

398
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,375
I get it believe me I'm all

399
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,215
Newport Centre mall tapped out myself between the Amazon tap

400
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,519
Couple of God's Echo Google home

401
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:48,127
So this would have to be different but it appeal it was different enough to appeal to me

402
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
At that price

403
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
I haven't backed up yet but

404
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
Think I just might

405
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Okay

406
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Well

407
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
You know the other thing is

408
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
This looks pretty bright so

409
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:02,975
Hopefully they got it like that like most smartphones it has a sensor in there that can read the ambient light and

410
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
Dims automatically based on that so

411
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
Oh and it's powered by the next things chip

412
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
I love the chip

413
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
The southern

414
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
Has become the next thing

415
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
Makes a $9

416
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
Development

417
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,103
No chip Pro is a little bit more but

418
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
I freaking love that come

419
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
All right very exciting

420
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
Justice

421
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
Let's talk about

422
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
Now that we're done with her

423
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
Gadget fetish

424
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,135
Let's go into

425
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,975
00 security vulnerabilities

426
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
Devil's ivy

427
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
Oh my gosh

428
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,607
And this is something is a vulnerability that affects

429
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,399
IP base security

430
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
Cameras mostly but

431
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,007
Don't they all

432
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,335
That's the security cameras have been connected to the internet

433
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,151
Are long time forever before we even thought about all the stuff

434
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,479
So this one is

435
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:02,879
Particularly nasty because it is a vulnerability in open source software that is used by

436
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
A lot

437
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
Southeast security

438
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
The prevalence

439
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
Of the vulnerabilities

440
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
However

441
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,351
It doesn't appear too easy to exploit

442
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Redken

443
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,471
That yeah that's that's correct time in its

444
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:23,871
Once a device is compromised you actually have to have the user like uploader or get it like a tool Big File

445
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,479
It's not likely it's going to be exploited it's more of a buffer crash type thing

446
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
Overrun

447
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
But it's still not good

448
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,879
So it's not as nasty as a lot of other things we can make the Mirai bot for example

449
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
Talking about months and months ago

450
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,231
It's nothing like that but it's still concerning

451
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,815
I believe it was axis Communications

452
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,375
They say that about 249 of their

453
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
Camera models

454
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,959
Perfected they've already patched them

455
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
And they have

456
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,287
Shared information with the

457
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:57,663
Industry at large on how to fix things but it's going to be up to each individual Hardware

458
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,735
Maker to update firmware cuz that's the only way to fix

459
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,087
Speaking of the FBI

460
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
People about

461
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
Connected toys

462
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:14,047
This is like a recurring theme with them I feel like it's once a year if I got time to other people about those smart toys

463
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,863
Or just smart things the FBI has done a

464
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
A warning about

465
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
Devices in general

466
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,519
This specific device is about privacy

467
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
Which

468
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
It's important it is important

469
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,663
But it basically goes in and it's like hey consumer

470
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,735
Lays out why iot toys are vulnerable

471
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
Why you should care

472
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,575
And then it's got a section called what should I do

473
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
And I'm really

474
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
Hat

475
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,183
I'm cheesed about this because the wind should I do section

476
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
Can is incredibly long

477
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
It is

478
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
Just

479
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,351
Mind-boggling that you would think a consumer would do this

480
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:53,983
So some of those things are research if your toys can receive firmware software updates and security patches

481
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,031
If they can ensure these

482
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
Irenic that's great

483
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Right

484
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,943
Research where user data is stored with the company third-party services or both

485
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
I am

486
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,039
Quarter have asked Mattel for data on

487
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
This type of thing

488
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,391
Including they also talked about

489
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:17,791
Do they use authentication when pairing a device via Bluetooth and do they use encryption when transmitting data from the Wi-Fi access point in

490
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,863
Why is reporter have sent this data to me

491
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
These questions

492
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
Mattel

493
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,959
Mattel was like

494
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,871
Feeling like a consumer can just call up Mattel and be like hey I want to buy this

495
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,175
Connected Barbie doll for twenty bucks

496
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
So

497
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,783
Yeah this this to me points out

498
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
That we've got a big dick

499
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,599
Pinhole in consumers

500
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:48,255
So I totally agree with you as I look at some of the other questions and I'll read the disclosures and privacy policies to see if a company is victim

501
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
My Cyber attack

502
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,351
What will the company do if they were you know will they notify you

503
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,447
Where's your data being stored

504
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,007
All great questions but just as you said

505
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,591
People are not going to call and ask about that in the few that do

506
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,127
Where can I get the answers

507
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,687
So here's a thought just a thought I don't

508
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
Like to get into

509
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,087
Regulations and policy and whatnot but in this case I'm going to throw it out there

510
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,440
Should there be answers to those questions at least a high level

511
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,744
On the packaging for all of these devices

512
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,352
Yes this gets into this idea of having a some sort of labeling

513
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,888
First Data

514
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,192
And I totally

515
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
We should have

516
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,032
Basic consumer

517
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,056
Info for the stuff

518
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,616
And I feel like the FBI saying

519
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,408
It is not like Congress is going to

520
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
Hawaii

521
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Thinking maps

522
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,064
I do think maybe the industry could get together in

523
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,856
You know some basics

524
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
Encryption

525
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
To the cloud

526
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
Today within the home

527
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,232
Where is the data stored

528
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
Your TOS is actually going to happen

529
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
Information about

530
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
Is it shared with her

531
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
Third-party data

532
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Companies

533
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:03,264
And you don't even expecting people to read through all of that to get there as kind of

534
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
Not right

535
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,592
That's her

536
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,128
Fallout 4

537
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,944
Quick bits of news

538
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,992
Particle which is an iot developer

539
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
The platform

540
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
That offers

541
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,624
Wi-Fi Cellular Connections it's a pretty

542
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,952
We talked to them before Zach's Apollo the CEOs been on

543
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,720
Show

544
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,280
Erase 20 million dollars from spark capital

545
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
They are

546
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
They're doing really well

547
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,400
I was surprised so particle has built

548
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
Is easy

549
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
To put in development

550
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,800
And they have about a hundred and twenty thousand people that are building iot products

551
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,384
That's pretty significant there in a bunch of products

552
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,944
Ideo uses them Looney lunar design

553
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
Mindtribe

554
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,016
Actually power that Met Gala

555
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
IBM Watson

556
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,576
Dressed LED dress for the

557
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
Costumes

558
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,928
Yeah so they were there and uses them to track their

559
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Campus bicycles

560
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
Pretty cool

561
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Lot of money for them

562
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,304
I am very excited

563
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Because

564
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,424
My gosh building iot connected products is hard and

565
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,496
2 days to a company that has started up trying

566
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Easier and in

567
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,312
Donald learned a lot of

568
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,616
Las Vegas has a

569
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,152
NB iot Network

570
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,968
That is building when conjunction with people

571
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248
So I thought

572
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Vegas fan

573
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,112
So I thought this was interesting they're going to use it for

574
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:26,720
Smart cities efforts in there doing a partnership Las Vegas is doing a partnership with call, derickson

575
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,024
As part of this nb iot Network

576
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
They're going to

577
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,584
Disconnect flood in storm

578
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,608
Drainage sensors

579
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,656
LED lighting and some

580
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
Weather temperatures

581
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,776
An environmental Network or a sensor for the weather

582
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
Hot hot and hot

583
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,640
Sometimes it's cold and rainy

584
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
But yes normally

585
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
All right and then

586
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
Final bit of news in the

587
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,600
Iot wide area network business Comcast

588
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,416
Has launched their machineq

589
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,976
Product which is a lorawan

590
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
A worldwide

591
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
In

592
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,608
12 more cities

593
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
So

594
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,728
This is big news about a year ago Comcast took a chunk of Senate

595
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,544
Which is a company that makes the Laura chips

596
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,616
And they said they were like Hey we're going to try this

597
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,200
Basically they are expanding it to Seattle

598
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:24,320
A bunch of other cities and the idea that is not to create a city-wide

599
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:28,672
Lauren at work but to create these kind of private Lauren that works in like

600
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,976
Manufacturing spaces

601
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
For warehouses

602
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,328
I think it would be kind of a really interesting

603
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
I guess thing to watch

604
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,704
So Kevin I think we've done a great job this week on the show

605
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,520
And in the coming weeks we actually want to do

606
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
Consumer-oriented

607
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
We answer your questions

608
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,384
Segments

609
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
I would love

610
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,248
For you guys if you have questions you guys are really great about sending them

611
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,552
But keep sending them to info

612
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,856
At iot podcast. Com

613
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,440
Kevin and I are going to try to answer some of your questions on the air

614
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
And now

615
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,144
A message from our sponsor haverwood we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast

616
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,496
But the message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Allegiant the makers of Schlage

617
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,544
Locks and I have Rob Martin

618
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,824
Who is the futurist

619
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
OverWatch League

620
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
Here to talk to us

621
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,688
About the smart home by Rob

622
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
Hi Stacy thanks for having

623
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
I am super excited so

624
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,856
Let's dig into this idea of things in the connected home

625
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,880
Working with Eva

626
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
Everything else

627
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
How do you think about that

628
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
Well

629
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,256
I think there is a lot of

630
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,560
Misconceptions around

631
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:42,400
How things actually work today versus what's advertised

632
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,424
And media

633
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:49,312
The truth is is that Integrations the fancy word for the ability to work with other connected stuff

634
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,336
Our kind of fickle

635
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,128
You're best off select

636
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,712
Testing devices that are going to suit a very specific purpose for you

637
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
First

638
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,016
And then looking at

639
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:02,368
What types of recipes routines robots whatever you want to call them

640
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,648
You can connect with

641
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Later on

642
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,000
Now you guys so far has decided not to integrate

643
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,048
With the unlock function on your

644
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,096
Can you explain kind of your thinking there

645
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,192
Stacy Schlage is a security company for

646
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,312
So we're a little different than some other people who are focused on simply the convenience

647
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
And comfort

648
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
Of the Smart Home

649
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,896
We're concerned

650
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
About the

651
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,736
The security of anyone behind that door

652
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,272
And we want to be certain

653
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
That your intent

654
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,832
Is to unlock

655
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,416
So what the voice assistance or next Generation technology

656
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,208
We support things

657
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488
Dislike door status

658
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Locking

659
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
But unless we can

660
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,584
Can be 100% certain that is you

661
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,864
We won't unlock the door

662
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
Do you think we'll ever get there I do

663
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,240
I think we will get there I think there's lots of

664
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
Nursing technology

665
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,336
And as a futurist it's my job to explore that

666
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
So I can say

667
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
With some certain

668
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,480
Going to eat we're starting to see some really interesting technology come for

669
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,296
That is moving us closer and closer

670
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,600
To be able to do that with great certainty

671
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,672
Do you want to tell me what those Technologies are

672
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,536
So Stacy there are so many exciting new technologies headed our way

673
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,584
It is a futurist it's my job

674
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,376
Explore all of them

675
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
Weather at the

676
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
Facial recognition

677
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,728
All different

678
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
Types of biometric

679
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Shoes

680
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,872
Both persistent and non-persistent Technology

681
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,664
There is just a

682
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,456
Wide variety of Technology

683
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,736
See that you're going to see

684
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
Embedded

685
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,552
In many different types of

686
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,368
Security devices that are not only going to make it

687
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
Easier more convenient and simple

688
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,256
But potentially even more secure than it is today

689
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,072
Alright Rob where can I go to find out more

690
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,888
You can go to slate.com to learn more

691
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,912

Or follow me on Twitter on Atchley Pinterest

696
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,112
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

697
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
This is your host Stacey Higginbotham

698
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,024
Ken kolderup who is VP of marketing for the Bluetooths

699
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
Hi Ken

700
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
How are you doing today

701
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,888
I am doing very very well

702
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,912
Thanks for the opportune

703
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,680
I really

704
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,520
We are super excited because we have been talking about

705
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,544
Bluetooth

706
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Mesh

707
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
For what feels like

708
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
For two years

709
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,272
You guys just announced the Bluetooth mesh Spectre

710
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
We are so excited

711
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
This feels like

712
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,416
It was made for the Internet of Things

713
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,440
So

714
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,208
Talk to us

715
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
What is

716
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,560
Guess you're right it was made for the inter

717
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:57,472
And so specifically it is we are adding an additional Network topology

718
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,544
This one happens to be a Mesh networking

719
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,360
Topology so now what that means it allows

720
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,408
You'll have many to many device can you

721
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
What that means

722
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,296
Is it really suited for applications like building automation

723
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:15,136
Wireless sensor networks asset tracking things like that new

724
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,416
Have up-and-coming Market

725
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
It's where you have

726
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,488
Tens or hundreds or

727
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,280
Or even thousands of device

728
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
Is that somehow need to

729
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,864
Securely and reliably connect

730
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,960
So it builds on all the other capabilities Bluetooth has

731
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,008
Which is already supports a kind of a coin

732
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
The point Network topology

733
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
Broadcast topology

734
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,872
And now with this we are adding

735
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,896
A mesh Network

736
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
Anthropologie

737
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,992
Okay in a little bit we're going to get into

738
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,528
How you guys are doing the

739
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
Before that

740
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344
Let's try to

741
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
Focusing on

742
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,416
How this relates to

743
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
The other flavors of

744
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,744
Bluetooth so now we have Bluetooth

745
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
Classic Blues

746
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,328
And then we have Bluetooth low energy

747
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,632
Where does MASH fit in with

748
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,728
Actually there are only two flavors of Bluetooth that stays

749
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
True with the introduction of mass

750
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,104
For those of you that or where we started Bluetooth

751
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,152
21 years ago in the initial

752
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:13,248
Labor a Bluetooth is something that is called basic rate enhanced data rate

753
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
Or breeder

754
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,160
And that one so it was a really good technology and still is today or crazies kind of

755
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,696
Continuous wireless connection

756
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,744
Stream audio over

757
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,560
And that's what's the technology today behind

758
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,608
The whole wireless audio industry

759
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
Weather in headsets

760
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,424
Speakers are in car systems

761
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,216
It also supports a simple

762
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,288
Point-to-point Network topology for one to one device

763
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,592
That's a really really good Mark

764
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
Then back in

765
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,664
2010 timeframe

766
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,200
We launched the second

767
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
Flavor of Love

768
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
Which is

769
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
Cold low energy

770
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,296
Or Bluetooth LE

771
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,368
It is a yellow wire breeder was for

772
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,648
Continuous Wireless connect

773
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,720
Bluetooth LE is form or short bursts Wireless

774
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,304
It really was done to enable

775
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
Really really low power

776
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,680
Consumption it was initially targeted at at what the time was this nation

777
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
Connected

778
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
Device Market

779
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,544
Wle came along and they also supported that

780
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,824
The same point

781
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
The point Network

782
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,360
Topology

783
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,896
But now it was really for

784
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:16,736
What kind of data transfer services rather than streaming services and was

785
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,784
Again targeted that connected device mark

786
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,368
Interesting thing about Bluetooth LE is when we launched it

787
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,904
Not only did it also

788
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
Support point-to-point

789
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
Bre Dr

790
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,744
I mean also introduced

791
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,792
Another topology called Broad

792
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,608
Really around one too many

793
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
Medication

794
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,704
What does evolved into over the last couple of years left

795
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,288
People are really using for that or is this whole kind of Beacon Market

796
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:46,944
Yeah those kind of point-of-interest beacons there's item fighting deconcilis Technologies you now.

797
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,344
See out there that use Bluetooth is a way to find your lost keys or your wallet or your phone or even using deacons as a way to find you

798
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
Your way around an airport

799
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,464
Or Conference Center or Stadium

800
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
Broadcast

801
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,000
Last apology

802
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
For one too many

803
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,072
And that leaves us where we are today with mash

804
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
What mesh is

805
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,400
It's not another flavor of Bluetooth

806
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,448
It's just an additional Network

807
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,216
Pieology Austin

808
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,776
Available for Bluetooth low energy

809
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,080
So does Bill on top of Ellie

810
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,920
So mess is all about how you can enable now

811
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:22,528
Dementia before tens hundreds or even thousands of Bluetooth LE devices

812
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,832
To be able to exchange messages together

813
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
Anna Faris

814
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,392
Usher reliable in

815
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,416
Available way

816
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
All right

817
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,976
So Bluetooth classic

818
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
No mesh

819
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
Bluetooth LE

820
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Jasmine

821
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,096
And it's going to go back

822
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,888
How far to what versions of

823
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,984
I decided to develop the Bluetooth mess Fest

824
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,032
Medication such that they would work back to you

825
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,872
Any Bluetooth LE that was 4. O or higher

826
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,408
This is really helpful

827
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,736
And for those of us who are super excited

828
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,296
Fashion I'm going to include myself in this category

829
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,600
I'm looking forward to it because I am

830
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,928
Excited about being able to control lights in my smart home

831
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,976
Bluetooth light bulbs

832
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,024
Without having to go to the floor there actually are

833
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
Which is right now.

834
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
Fireball

835
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,144
That's just me but what else are people thinking

836
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
Think about using

837
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
A lot of it

838
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,384
But let me go a little bit more into that so building Automation in general is an area where we see a lot

839
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
Olive activities that's looking

840
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,224
Bluetooth mesh to there

841
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,320
Then there's the wireless sensors O2 sensor Market in general

842
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,368
Especially kind of in industrial use case

843
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,952
Where they're looking to evolve their sensor Network

844
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
Wireless or economic

845
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,304
Endure being able to add more devices

846
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,864
Really helping out in there and they also NASA

847
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
Certain areas where

848
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,960
This technology really makes a lot of

849
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,544
Those are three big bucket areas where we see a lot of act

850
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,848
Building automation

851
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
I use that term relatively

852
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,432
Broadly there cuz there's residential which is

853
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,224
Is the smart home when what you kind of brought up

854
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,296
And which will be right in the middle of that as well

855
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,344
But when I'm really excited about is more than

856
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
Commercial area.

857
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,976
Where there are a lot of companies now that are

858
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
Targeting that for

859
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:13,120
Whether it's lighting or heating cooling or security or so forth

860
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,680
Aurelia doing a lot of sophisticated automation

861
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,448
Control

862
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,728
For the building

863
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,872
And in their we're seeing a lot of energy where the initial thing is I'm actually on Commercial Lighting

864
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,664
We're seeing a lot of movement

865
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
In commercial lighting

866
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,504
Because the business case is pretty straightforward therefore

867
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
People wear

868
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:34,880
There's this whole other changes of what right now people going from complex fluorescent

869
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,928
And those buildings over to LED

870
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,720
At that time going over to wireless

871
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,256
Control makes a lot of sense

872
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:46,912
Is a lot of kind of governmental and local regulation going in for smart buildings and energy efficient buildings and so forth

873
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:53,312
A lot of things and planets aligning right now for that commercial building Automation and lighting specifically

874
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:57,920
Getting a lot of traction so you'll see a lot of activity in there

875
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,712
A few questions

876
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,504
What and these can be quick answer

877
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:06,624
Bluetooth mesh because it's compatible with Bluetooth low energy that means it is

878
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
Lord

879
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,184
Erase or rather

880
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,464
I won't be able to do audio

881
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
That's right these

882
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,048
Mesh networks not just

883
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Just Bluetooth

884
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,864
Despedida lobbies low-power mesh Network

885
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,680
Really intended at those kinds of yusuke

886
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:25,824
Amounts of data around facilities in math where the domain of other other Technologies are

887
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,360
This one is really a

888
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,152
In these areas we talked about where it's at

889
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,456
Building Automation and sensor networks rehab

890
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,504
Lots and lots and lots of devices

891
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,832
They need to communicate with each other but that's generally not

892
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
Streaming large amounts of data

893
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,672
It's kind of command-and-control have a net

894
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,768
Will Bluetooth mesh take advantage of the greater range

895
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
Bluetooth 5

896
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,400
The initial set of specifications do not look to Leverage

897
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,680
Some of the princess

898
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,472
The broadcast data capacity enhanced

899
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
Incurred in five

900
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,544
Are not part of the initial messed up

901
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,408
Doing four or Mash those aren't imperative

902
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
Sure

903
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
The biggest complaint

904
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
I've heard

905
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,528
About Bluetooth as a mesh Network

906
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:11,136
Up until this moment in time has been that it is a flood based as opposed to a routing

907
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
Bass network

908
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
End

909
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
Basically what that means

910
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,304
It's just shouting his messages to everyone all the time

911
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
I'm in that can get

912
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
That can overload assist

913
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,680
Right as opposed to having intelligent routing which

914
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,008
Is a little bit less flexible you have to plan for it there's

915
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,312
There's constraints on both sides right

916
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,592
What you guys are

917
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
Done is y'all have

918
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:32,896
Created this

919
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
Intelligent

920
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,736
So explain to me how this is going

921
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,856
That's right so you a couple of years ago in when the group started this

922
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:48,256
Zephyr to create the mess specifications that was absolutely Abby imagined

923
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,304
What's the message

924
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,352
Transmission

925
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,912
You do around it approached or you do a flooded

926
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
And when they went

927
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,264
Through the whole exercise of looking at the requirements

928
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
Sports

929
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,824
Dale and reliability

930
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
Simplicity and everything else

931
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,664
It was really couldn't get there

932
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,944
With the route is broke

933
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,248
So I'll go I'll go back to the example of

934
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
Commercial Lighting where I have to have a

935
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,320
Switch

936
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,344
Turn on

937
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,160
Hundreds of lights all the same time massive multiki

938
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
Yelp

939
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,744
And you really can't get there with a router

940
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,792
Show is agreed that applied approach

941
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,840
Wireless mesh Networks

942
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Very very unique

943
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,144
Fundamentally different

944
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
And so have the

945
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,240
Requirements in different capabilities

946
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:33,568
It was determined after that the flood base approach was

947
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,872
Was uniquely suited for that

948
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,712
The kinds of scale the kind of reliability so it's inherently

949
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
Multipass

950
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,760
It's inherently selfish

951
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
Inherently no points

952
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,624
Failure rather than trying to engineer those things

953
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,440
Now you mention you got to be careful though

954
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,024
In a flood approach this deal with some of the power Quest

955
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,656
So those are those are things we done into what we call a manager

956
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,192
Blood approach for message

957
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,008
So for instance simple time to live counter

958
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,032
To make sure that message

959
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,056
Propagation doesn't

960
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,592
Go unnecessarily

961
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:10,944
Message caching so you don't get into an unnecessary looping they're looking a message

962
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,016
We have the relay function itself

963
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,064
Is actually not mange

964
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,904
Date when you provision device you declare whether that's

965
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,720
It's going to be relay messages or not

966
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:26,816
You wouldn't have a an on main power node for instance relay message

967
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,352
It would be too much energy

968
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,656
So is a developer I can set my

969
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,936
A device to be

970
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
Router

971
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,032
Have router functionality versus

972
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
Not or

973
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:45,760
Provisioning a Mains powered device

974
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
You would probably

975
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,064
Give that the real

976
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,112
Here's a message

977
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,648
There's not for itself

978
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
Then it will then retransmit that

979
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
QuikTrip is a sensor

980
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,280
Hanging out on battery I don't want that

981
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
Stop by when

982
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,936
Heavy duty cycle over there would be associated with having to have that on and listen

983
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,704
For those messages

984
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:10,336
OU more than that you mentioned a great one there like a sensor that sitting here in a coin cell battery

985
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,152
Even if it's not real aim you need to make sure that doesn't happen

986
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
Sit there and have it

987
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,224
Your radio all the time even listening

988
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
So there are other additional

989
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,296
Functions that can be

990
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
Provisions into any

991
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,136
So if you are a battery-powered

992
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
Sensor

993
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,952
You be given a look all the low power notes

994
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,744
And there's also a

995
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
Companion function called a friend

996
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,584
What you would provision into other main power device

997
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
Surround it

998
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
Low power

999
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:38,240
Node wakes up with this function in it first thing it does is look for a friend around it

1000
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,776
They set up a relationship

1001
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,848
And that one Indian down messages that are busy or Destin

1002
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:48,224
For the low-power note to friend hold on to it and then that that low power

1003
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,808
Minutes

1004
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,344
And then retrieve this message

1005
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
Messages from the friend

1006
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,440
There's techniques in these other Solutions use not yours

1007
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,512
Somewhat similar techniques but it's all around allowing for these

1008
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,584
Battery-powered nose to operate for many many years on this

1009
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,608
Single coin cell

1010
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,144
Oh my God that sounds

1011
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,960
Very useful and totally applicable towards

1012
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,264
I'm surprised you're selling but it also sounds so incredible

1013
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,152
Is this something that I now have to figure out is part of the spec

1014
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,968
Or is this something that you guys are going to do for meat like

1015
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,016
How much of this do I need to do

1016
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,880
That's right there along with the Bluetooth

1017
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,928
Your radio you're going to get the mess stack if you

1018
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,464
UL weather yeah there's many ways

1019
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,536
The source that whether it's from the Silicon provider Independence

1020
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
Within there

1021
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:39,936
And then there's a provisioning tool that is provided to you as well and that's what's response

1022
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:44,032
Possible for when you provision a device making that a very straightforward

1023
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
Exercise

1024
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,104
How does this handle IPv6

1025
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,456
There is work underway to allow my pecan Chevy with a Bluetooth generic

1026
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,760
But what we're trying to do with this is us

1027
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,320
You know that I could get for use for many many use cases

1028
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:00,416
That's not what's getting you so for actually enabling a mess

1029
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,440
Based messaging

1030
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
So how do I

1031
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,024
Yo transmitter

1032
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,072
Messages for command-and-control purposes

1033
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,864
Many many many devices

1034
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,168
That is not leveraging ipv4

1035
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,704
Rb6 is part of that

1036
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,264
Bright so I won't have a match that spans different IP

1037
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
Snow

1038
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,104
Got it okay

1039
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
So

1040
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,200
There's been a lot of conversation about different

1041
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
Profiles

1042
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,528
And I don't think you guys you call a mesh models

1043
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,600
And there's one for lighting that's been developed

1044
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,440
Tell me a little bit about what this is because it feels a little

1045
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,792
So if you're used to Bluetooth you've heard

1046
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
The car the profile turned

1047
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:45,472
Before that's how we talked about whether they were gapped profiles or the traditional profiles for b r e d r l e

1048
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:49,056
That was proposed to find how Communications happen between

1049
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,104
Do devices using that simple point.

1050
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
Wing connection

1051
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,687
Now when you go to mash that hire kind of app

1052
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,711
Application layer

1053
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,735
Now if you will

1054
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:02,879
So what defines a node on the network in the behavior of that node on the network that's done with something called

1055
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,927
Model model

1056
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,487
And the way that we approach that

1057
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:13,887
Is really a very powerful way where there's a number of generic models that you use to them to find what the big

1058
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,191
Behavior of a device on the network is Caesar buried

1059
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:22,591
Very simple things were talking to on and off you up down those types of generic definition

1060
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,127
Define envy

1061
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:28,479
Library of math models that were that are beans part of the specification

1062
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:33,087
So if I have a mesh model for and you can have one for like lighting

1063
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,111
What other models

1064
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:40,767
Generics that are just for buy everything and then there are some areas that have been gone into more

1065
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,815
4 of theirs lighting is a big Focus

1066
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,583
Did we mention

1067
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,375
Sensors the whole set of definition

1068
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,167
Surround sensors so that's the other

1069
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,959
Really really big initial use cases

1070
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,567
So you'll see stop an asset tracking and other other areas

1071
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,591
Is well okay

1072
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
So now

1073
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,175
I hear the phrase mesh models and I think

1074
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,711
Zigbee profiles

1075
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:00,991
If you are

1076
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:05,343
He may not have been a huge student of zigbee profiles but you know there's like

1077
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
Home automation lights

1078
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,439
However many datos that they had

1079
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:14,303
And it was very confusing because not all of your Zippy devices would actually work together

1080
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,351
When you brought them home

1081
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,143
Unless they were part of the same

1082
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:18,911
Profile

1083
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,471
And so when I'm hearing

1084
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
You talk about

1085
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,055
Mesh models I am getting

1086
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,639
Flashback to zigbee profiles and JB did away with them

1087
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
7-Zip III

1088
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,991
It still scares me so I'm worried that I

1089
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,015
Bluetooth which is

1090
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
Works really well

1091
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,367
The Mind trust that has done that it is

1092
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,159
Do they come up with an approach is

1093
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
Incredible power

1094
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,487
Incredibly flexible and addresses the

1095
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,535
Concerns you have about interoperability

1096
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
Right so

1097
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,351
For instance just to talk through this

1098
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,375
54 seconds

1099
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:54,495
Which is actually when you provision a device on network

1100
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,519
It goes and does

1101
00:43:55,775 --> 00:44:00,127
Theory of all the capabilities of that device and then that makes

1102
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,687
Just all come together so it's it takes the

1103
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,247
To the actual person who's doing the provisioning weather that's

1104
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,039
Consumer rated commercial contacts

1105
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:12,415
All that it's all that end or the developer that's all in place that does come together

1106
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:17,023
If I got a product that is running running a lighting Bosch model

1107
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,095
And I've got another product that is running a sensor measure

1108
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,399
Can they talk to each other

1109
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:28,799
Isn't that comes into the role of the provisioner that the provisions that will not a person so this is the provisioning configuration tool to get the

1110
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,591
You get supplied with when you

1111
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,871
By this message the system

1112
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
These are system

1113
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,943
Institutions are being presented to you

1114
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,527
Aquarius device ID knows what kind of device it is okay it's alright

1115
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,343
What's a thermostat

1116
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,671
Thanks and then it also knows what capabilities.

1117
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:52,095
And then is responsible for presenting this in a way that allows it gave you these things can work

1118
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:57,215
Together right so that's the burden is put on the provisioning tool to make that very very straightforward and

1119
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
The end-user

1120
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,519
Okay

1121
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,823
So let's talk about how long it's going to take

1122
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
To get

1123
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,895
2 mesh Bluetooth in

1124
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:05,919
Commercial

1125
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,687
Products

1126
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,783
When there's changes in the Spectre effect

1127
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,807
The radio layer

1128
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,087
Like witches 5 did

1129
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,159
There's a natural. Time it needs to have

1130
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,463
For those products to

1131
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,999
It developed and tested in

1132
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
At the market

1133
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:24,095
That was his message that we said this is another radio flavor of

1134
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,655
Valve software layer the network

1135
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,935
So things can happen

1136
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
More rapidly

1137
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:35,103
So y'all are normal answer here is typically on within 6 months you'll start to see products in the market I think here you'll see stuff

1138
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,407
What happened pretty quickly based on the amount of

1139
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,991
Of activities has already been going on here for quite some time

1140
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:47,135
In the maturity of some of the solutions that are already out there so I think you'll see things will certainly this year and hopefully pretty quick

1141
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
