Aloha

10
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,576
We are going to talk about Facebook's plans possibly for a smart speaker

11
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:30,464
How Google took sensors and Ai and saved a lot of money and data center Cooling

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,280
A new survey about how scary iot is Plus

13
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560
A couple exploits that

14
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,608
Show how scary is he his

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,400
In our news this week

16
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,936
Some Acquisitions to talk about

17
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,984
Industrial iot and

18
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,288
Be Fitbit charge 3

19
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,056
And

20
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:45,824
This week

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,224
Our Guest is Tyler Baker who is the CTO of foundries. IO this is a brand-new iot

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
Platform from the

23
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,528
The people who brought you lindaro

24
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
This is

25
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,160
We'll talk about is basically offering security-as-a-service

26
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,464
Interesting points there

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,304
And we're going to have a message from our sponsor Netgear

28
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
Talking about

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
Inside wi-fi system

30
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,680
So let's get this show started

31
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,216
With a message from

32
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
Another one

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,664
This week sponsor is a pharaoh are you looking for an iot platform find out why Kenmore

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,064
Angelique picked a farro a farro customers have experienced as much as 80% reduction in

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,464
I'm too Market 99% you are support calls and a 10x higher activation rate

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,864
They can we use 90% of their work from one project to the next to learn more is it a pharaoh

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,960
Bro. IO that's a f e r o. IO

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
Okay Kevin

39
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,824
Let us get this

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Party started

41
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
Let's talk about Facebook

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Aloha

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,456
I don't know if they mean Hello or goodbye

44
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,760
That is there

45
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
Voice

46
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
Service that they are

47
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:06,208
Planning to do there's a Code out there for Aloha even leading to additional code talking about a smart

48
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
Speaker called

49
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Portal

50
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
And

51
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
I think

52
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,352
We talked about a Facebook speaker in the past because

53
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,424
They were supposed to be rolling out

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,008
Speaker earlier last year

55
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
499

56
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,592
That is high 1 and 2

57
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,432
Yeah she makes sense because Facebook doesn't make any hardware so I don't know what kind of

58
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,992
Economies of scale they have to build off of it.

59
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Point right so that's

60
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,808
It's going to be a challenge for that Miss fat is

61
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,344
True on the price

62
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,904
Yeah

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Lynch

64
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
Pink is

65
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
Privacy

66
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
Privacy

67
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,256
Facebook

68
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
People don't really trust based

69
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
And that was why

70
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,912
Put their plans on hold it sounded like originally

71
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,472
I don't think they've actually solve their problems

72
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,056
Sweet People worried about privacy I know that people are still on Facebook

73
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,872
But think about how prevalent the rumor is that

74
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:01,504
Your Facebook is constantly listening in even on your phone people take this all the time cuz they'll be talking about something

75
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
Sunnyvale CA

76
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,672
Yeah that's a good point in fact the whole speaker plans

77
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
Seem to fall

78
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
Part last year when there were major privacy concerns brought up by the US government with the election and

79
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,192
Other consumer issues there so yeah and it made sense to back off on that up

80
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,984
I'm not even sure it makes sense to

81
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,872
Continue it though you tell me and I do use Facebook Facebook for my private stuff we have a Facebook page

82
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
Stacey on iot

83
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
So we use it

84
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
Mail from business standpoint

85
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,552
And I use messenger with the family because that allows me to be crossed

86
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,344
Platform since I switched phones

87
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
SOI Theron on iMessage

88
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,440
Set reminder on Android you can't get me there so

89
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
I don't really see the

90
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,048
Point of this because they want to add voice to their

91
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
Messaging apps

92
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
And

93
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Perhaps

94
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
Through your posts even through Instagram is a chat service and I don't see a huge benefit they're from

95
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,872
An end-user standpoint I certainly see a benefit for Facebook cuz maybe we'll get even more of our day.

96
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,944
What do you think even though you may not use Facebook as much as I do

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,784
Will it might be because when you talk to Facebook

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
Messenger

99
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
You're actually using

100
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
Google are apples

101
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
Speech to text

102
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
Yes because that's the keyboard will pop up so whatever keyboard you're using and it could be a third-party keyboard in fact on Android

103
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,911
Somebody else is getting the data Facebook is not

104
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:28,031
The only thing you can do natively in the app is record a voice clip which then gets sent as an audio file

105
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,127
Okay so Facebook probably wants access to that sweet sweet voice data

106
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
Because then you can build all kinds of

107
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,271
Another idea in this does not throw me at all but

108
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,111
Die-hard Facebook users might but imagine something like Google's

109
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,719
Flip camera that uses machine-learning to understand when to take the best pictures

110
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,839
Maybe imagine like something like that in your home from Facebook and then you could just send those pictures to your loved ones

111
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,655
I would again never do that

112
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:01,055
But I would never do that either but your point makes more sense when you even think about the patents that Facebook

113
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:07,455
Has which also came to like this week via TechCrunch reported this story they have they been Facebook as a pet

114
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
For a smart

115
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
Speaker as well as a

116
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,343
Smart camera and a video

117
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
Camera so

118
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,743
Doesn't mean you're going to use those patents for actual products but you're right they could

119
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
Facebook with

120
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,631
And so when I can people

121
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
I guess I mean

122
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,983
It's really a shame that we don't have unified platform

123
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
Farms for video chat

124
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
Thanks apple with FaceTime

125
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
Hangout I guess

126
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
I'm just kind of like

127
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,503
You know the telephone at work so well right now we're adding video

128
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807
We want to share so much more with our loved ones in

129
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:51,231
The telephone was great except that little rotary thing with numbers on it and it just doesn't make sense to Millennials it's actually kind of funny

130
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
Chords

131
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Okay

132
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
Let's talk about

133
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
This is an iot story

134
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
Sort of

135
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,751
It's been

136
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,823
What is why you put all these sensors in place

137
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,407
It's not because you're like

138
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,735
It's so you guys should do cool things

139
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:19,135
Lake Google basically save 40% in cooling cost or electrical cost for there

140
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
Data Center

141
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Beihai

142
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
And again the sensors that.

143
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
People that data

144
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:30,399
So every time we talk about businesses and iot we're talking about this idea

145
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
Digital transformation

146
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
This is a really great

147
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
And scary example

148
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,567
Doing that and moving from

149
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,383
The AI making recommendations to people

150
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
To actually

151
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
Take action in automator

152
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,807
This is a really scary step whenever I talk to Industrial iot people there like

153
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,879
That's a terrible idea will never do it

154
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
Well they made

155
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Google did

156
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
And again

157
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
Energy-savings

158
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,679
And see I think this is what people lose when they talk about IRT because it means so many things to so many different people weave

159
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,263
We've had data collection and big data for several years now

160
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,311
Analyzing data is not new

161
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
Doing something

162
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
Automated

163
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
Based on the data

164
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
That is new

165
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,319
The new wish in a way that people can have a bad day and I noticed something

166
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
And then you can make even finer

167
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,439
More finely-tuned things when you're automating based on machines

168
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
I'm excited about

169
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,095
So this is a big deal it almost actually

170
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
The Energy savings

171
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
Garnered from this almost made up for

172
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
The cost

173
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
Energy using

174
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,567
Kris of adding new data centers

175
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
So is a big deal because

176
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
As you guys are

177
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,479
Crusader digital footprint

178
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:53,087
Connected devices best we need to build data centers and eventually we could be like

179
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
Data centers are sucking on their power

180
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:59,487
About 1.8% of all electricity generated according to a report in 22

181
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
16

182
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
Is a long time ago

183
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,863
That actually that report was saying that by now would be

184
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
We almost be screwed but

185
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,239
So far we're using things like Renewables and

186
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
Techniques like this to

187
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
Keep it

188
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
Relatively flat

189
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,383
Which is good now we just need the Bitcoin miners to stop

190
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
Yeah a lot of areas have you

191
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,039
Speaking of what type of scary

192
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343
This is a survey from dynatrace

193
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,463
Over half of consumers worldwide are using iot devices

194
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
Two-thirds of those

195
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
I've already encountered

196
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
Performance issue

197
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
And

198
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
SLO with lots of devices

199
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
True statement

200
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,567
Consumers experience on average 1.5 digital performance problems every day

201
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:51,711
And 62% of people fear the number of problems they encounter in the frequency will increase due to the rise of iot

202
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
Just call that glitches

203
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:01,183
This ridiculous that was interesting as well 72% of consumers Faith likely that glitches in iot apps will cost

204
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Serious injuries

205
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,231
Yes I could

206
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Of course

207
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,375
They're including in the survey they talked about self-driving cars and so on

208
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
Support so yeah you have a glitch there

209
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Certainly you

210
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Probably have an injury but

211
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Regardless

212
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,151
It's a valid concern performance issues they're worried about RB

213
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
Because of bugs in them

214
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,247
Technology

215
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:30,111
It has not been part of the reason it has not it's because I

216
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
WiseWay two years ago we bought this house

217
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
I've never carried a key to this house

218
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,999
But the Smart Lock I bought

219
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,535
Has a

220
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Keypad as well

221
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,119
So the only way I can be locked out is it the battery

222
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Actually die

223
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
That is

224
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
However however

225
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,335
Just like people use the little high-tech he's actually hide a key somewhere

226
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
Somebody smart locks

227
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
Have 9 volt terminals

228
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,991
Hidden underneath them if you have a 9-volt battery you can give enough

229
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
Juice to actually get in your house

230
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,087
I'm not saying I hit a battery but

231
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
You never know

232
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,767
Karaoke I carry a knife

233
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Little steel wall I can start a fire

234
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Yes

235
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,703
Absolutely put steel wool on a 9-volt battery new and turns into flames

236
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
Very handy for camping

237
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,591
Life or death situations

238
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,175
Okay you're my friend I'll carry steel wool

239
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
You carry your battery and

240
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
And together

241
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
When we conquer the world

242
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
We're ready for the Apollo

243
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Okay

244
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
Zombies

245
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,951
Let's talk about some another performance problems associated with the iot

246
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,303
64% of customers fear not being able to control lights in the

247
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
Okay this is happened to me

248
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Insomniac

249
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,191
Vacations all ask madame

250
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
Somehow

251
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
My

252
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
Get connected light switch

253
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
Become disconnect

254
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
From something

255
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
Or they'll get reset

256
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
So this is a legit

257
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Agreed

258
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Senior

259
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
And this is kind of a

260
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
This is why we think trust is sober

261
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:07,903
81% of consumers are concerned that technology or software problems with Smart Meters will lead to them being overcharged

262
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
Forecast electricity

263
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
In water

264
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
So

265
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,351
I never thought about that but it's valid all the time both from like

266
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,423
You know your electrical provider all the way from

267
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
Like Verizon in your phone bill and

268
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,335
This is not necessarily a function of like sensors and iot Tech as much as it is like

269
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,407
Billing systems on the back end everything is automated

270
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
Why do things make

271
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Crunches

272
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
So

273
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,807
I may start going out to my meters in manually recording because

274
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
I never thought of this

275
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
Two-sided

276
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,231
I guess it double-sided access to some of these things

277
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
There are

278
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
Devices

279
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
Like curb or smapi

280
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
Or I can sense

281
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,167
That you can install on your phone that measures your electricity

282
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Consumption

283
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
So you can actually check that against you

284
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
Entirely

285
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,847
The same like one-to-one the same but it should be right

286
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,687
Yeah yeah some of those they go right into your electrical panel

287
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
If I recall

288
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,551
And so something like that or having a water flow meter

289
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
Are there so many

290
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,999
You can actually double-check that so I actually think

291
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,119
Yeah you get the added benefit because a lot of those water flow things will

292
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,679
Actually shut your water off because they're smart enough to know there's

293
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,495
Water slide when it really shouldn't be or normally isn't

294
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,079
So would prevent leaks and then you get the added benefit of being able to monitor

295
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
The actual slow as well

296
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,639
Yasso

297
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
While I agree that

298
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Iot

299
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,527
He's going to add another layer of complexity to are already comp

300
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Complex systems

301
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
I don't think it's

302
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
Will get more glitches but

303
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
You know we still don't have

304
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,183
Systems in place really too

305
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,535
Affect the glitches we have already in our existing systems look at like what happened with

306
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,327
Verizon employee not turning

307
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
Not not throttling

308
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
In California

309
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
That's something that actually

310
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
Automation

311
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
Yes

312
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:05,407
One would think yes I'm working on this fire for Emily weeks now let's not throttle the fire

313
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,199
Men and women that are fighting this fire

314
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
I don't know

315
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
I feel like

316
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Doesn't change it at

317
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
But

318
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,511
It's because people don't understand all the things you can do once you've connected

319
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Things like

320
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:27,423
That's me what it is they haven't thought through every possible use cases there are so many it's not until something bad happens like

321
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,471
We could have prevented that we have that data

322
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
And then the problem gets off

323
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
Yeah but that's kind of how

324
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
I know enough

325
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
Speaking of

326
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
Scary

327
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
This is an interesting article

328
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
Wolfram bleeping come

329
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,087
Computer tell you about flaws in smart irrigation system

330
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
And in this is actually

331
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,463
A team of Israeli researchers

332
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
Showed how

333
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
If you attack a couple

334
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,351
Irrigation system so smart Homer

335
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,631
You can actually use them

336
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
Campuses use them all kinds of

337
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,751
Please use them as well but if you attack enough sprinklers

338
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,055
You can empty a water tower

339
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
So

340
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
Dtac sprinklers

341
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,687
From Blue spray machine

342
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,735
And they found me

343
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
The sand

344
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,551
They reported all their vulnerabilities

345
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,135
But in drought-stricken areas this is actually a big tissue

346
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
And a problem

347
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
So

348
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
Do I tell people not to connect to their sprinklers

349
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
I don't know what's

350
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
The solution here

351
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,703
No I mean I wouldn't not have the product if you need it and you're aware of the vulnerabilities and the fact that these

352
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,519
Bardos are reported and likely be fixed

353
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,311
I wouldn't say don't do it

354
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
But it's scary that if it's almost like a denial-of-service

355
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,431
Like on the internet if somebody had control it

356
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:48,831
Theoretically here they did a damage calculation of 13550 sprinklers they could get rid of

357
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
3

358
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,951
1787 cubic meters of water in

359
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:58,559
6 minutes from a water tower and that is what they say typical water tower capacity

360
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
6 minutes

361
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
You would drain

362
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,191
The local water tower in this actually ties that something I put in

363
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
My newsletter

364
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,591
I had talked about again it's like a DDOS attack on the electrical grid basically

365
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,919
You can overwhelm an electrical grid if you pull

366
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
Too much demand

367
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
On the system

368
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:21,855
So the idea was you just use you know what your tacoyote devices and you

369
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,719
Increase air conditionings for example air conditioners to all run at the same time

370
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,559
I called it like flushing all the toilets at once in a door

371
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
Again this is

372
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,887
These are real world impacts from

373
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,471
Insecure devices that we might not think about like I may not be like

374
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,263
Soma air conditioners

375
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
An extra 20 minutes

376
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
If you time

377
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Play across all of

378
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
That could be a problem

379
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
That's a brown out

380
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,575
So there we go there scary things in the Internet of Things a popular connected device

381
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,159
You may own it has been

382
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,231
I guess we'll say has been hacked

383
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Again

384
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,839
We talk about these things all the time this one is pretty

385
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
Chicken dip

386
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
So I'm not unplugging

387
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,031
And it's only the WeMo Insight smart plug which is an older model

388
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
I know this

389
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,895
I have two of them as well in fact I recommended people use that

390
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,687
Plug your Hub into it because

391
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,271
You could get your hand goes down you could remotely start your hub

392
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,575
With a WeMo Insight smart plug

393
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:30,975
Yeah you're right this is that very particular attack I wouldn't want you to panic over it but the McAfee folks essentially down

394
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,535
Downloaded or extracted the firmware off

395
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,863
Open insight smart plug created their own little

396
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,399
Smart plug on a board

397
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:44,799
And then hacked it and then they can punch holes in your router and all that the thing is they would actually have to be on your

398
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Neural network to do this

399
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,639
Be physically present is not a

400
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:52,735
Thing that you should worry about per se and I'm sure that WeMo will fix it

401
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
But it should be

402
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
But yes it

403
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
Another

404
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
So if anyone

405
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
When comes into your house as

406
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
Your Wifi password

407
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
Don't get it don't give it to

408
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,535
This is where I'm going to just stress the importance of guests

409
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:11,167
If you're going to build an iot this is another thing.

410
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,239
And you put them on a guest Network and that's the same network you give to like

411
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
Your kids friends

412
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
That's a bad idea to

413
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:21,407
Just use the rule that I use at my house when you come over it's BYO I bring your own internet

414
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,687
Just use your for cheap

415
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,783
You're getting nothing

416
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807
Zippo

417
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Terrifying

418
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
Let's talk about

419
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,583
So if you guys are familiar with Vera

420
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
Z-Wave hub

421
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:48,543
The company has been bought by a company which makes its own

422
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
Z-Wave hub

423
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,615
So what can we expect for this

424
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Z-Wave hub

425
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,527
Well it's interesting what easy yellow and I don't know if it's that works as a little but whatever

426
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,087
It's interesting with Z-Wave hubs they make

427
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,927
They are super small and one reminds me of the Samsung

428
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:11,327
SmartThings link USB stick that I have in my Nvidia Shield which add zigbee and Z-Wave to my

429
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,631
Shield and it makes it run the SmartThings

430
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,751
Software so it becomes a hub easy yellow makes really small Z-Wave only hubs

431
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,543
One is a USB stick

432
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,639
One is actually a plug you just plug it into your electrical outlet

433
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,223
And I love that idea I love it cuz I don't want to see boxes all over

434
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Correct

435
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Avira soft

436
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
On

437
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
Yeah I don't know about

438
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Okay

439
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
Never use it

440
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
No idea

441
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
So

442
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,799
C3 is another tire

443
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:57,663
So C3 which is Tom siebels company they started out doing smart grid Smart Energy Management

444
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,479
Slowly transition to iot and

445
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,015
Of course AI

446
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
They have

447
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,879
Done a link up with the Google Cloud this means they support now the cuckoo

448
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:11,487
Cloud Amazon and Azure what's interesting to me here is that Google has

449
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,839
Really beat up their industrial iot efforts they did a deal with company called

450
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
Foghorn

451
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:17,887
Dayton

452
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,447
Others with industrial companies on the last Light

453
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
I hear maybe since CES

454
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,151
They've really started digging into industrial iot cuz they have been very far behind

455
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,687
An Enterprise is

456
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,599
Yeah we've talked about that a number of times but what is Google's iot strategy which is not a cohesive message and so I'm but I agree

457
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:43,999
This year has been a big year of catching up I'm not going to say they have caught up or haven't we'll see but this is definitely

458
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,607
The year they have made big strides and just real quick to plug something

459
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
Not smart plug but just plug plug

460
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,959
I was on the twit network

461
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,775
Know-how show which they cover IRT

462
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
And I was a guest

463
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,127
Talking about Google Android Android things

464
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:06,527
Industrial iot so I don't know if what I said make sense but if you want to listen to it and go to twitch.tv

465
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,111
Did I do okay

466
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,415
I don't like you did all right

467
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
Yes I did

468
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,839
The other person was a homekit person with

469
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,655
Enterprise industrial iot and I

470
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
Didn't agree at all with

471
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,495
What he said I didn't hear it until after it was

472
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,311
Published so I couldn't reply that so to speak but

473
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,103
Yeah that could just be me

474
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
Okay

475
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,527
Let's move on to Wi-Fi for airports

476
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:44,671
Security I know this is a Wi-Fi story is it an iot story only reason I put it in here it's cuz we talked actually

477
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
About various systems in

478
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
The home

479
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,535
That use Wifi as a security system

480
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
So

481
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,655
Wi-Fi is radio waves you guys and if you analyze those ready you can see things

482
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,447
And apparently you can see the

483
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
Very clearly

484
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,519
According to this research

485
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
You can find

486
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,151
Dimensions of metal objects or estimate the volume

487
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,175
Liquids

488
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,503
And this is a 95% accurate system

489
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,599
And this might make it so you don't have to do things like pull your laptop out of your thing

490
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,879
The TSA line

491
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
War

492
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,440
Toiletries

493
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
3 oz

494
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,256
Containers in the ziplock bag

495
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:25,376
The wi-fi system had a success rate of 99% for recognizing dangerous objects

496
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
98% / metals

497
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
And 95%

498
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,544
Now here is it perfect

499
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,824
Use for something that

500
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
They wouldn't use

501
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Because it's

502
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,640
Kimpton products

503
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,664
Google Glass

504
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,248
If you had TSA agents while you were standing in line walking around

505
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,320
They could be getting a feedback from the Wi-Fi signal

506
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:50,464
House and seeing individuals and who should be taking stuff out of their bag

507
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,768
Looks like a brick and I want to know what it is or you got

508
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,816
Too much liquid in there

509
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,120
Actually you could disable the Google

510
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
Last.of.the couldn't take

511
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Screenshot switch

512
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Indeed

513
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,520
Yasso though although although

514
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:08,128
That would also be useful for known Travelers and people who are on the do not fly list

515
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,432
Oh yeah

516
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,480
What can revive Google Glass on the Shelf

517
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,040
I still have my

518
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
That's why you want

519
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,440
But here's my cautionary tale for those of you guys who are like looking at this for a sec

520
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,024
Security system and maybe feel more secure because it's not a camera

521
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
This is pretty granular

522
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,120
So it may not actually be

523
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
Camera

524
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,448
But it's going to know a lot about you

525
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
So

526
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
Keep that in mind and

527
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,336
Because Wi-Fi signals are not contained unless you live in a faraday cage

528
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,920
You can actually read this outside your building so people can actually

529
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,224
Using this type of gear see what's

530
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,808
Like motion and what's happening inside your house even if they're not in

531
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
Insight it

532
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
Alright so

533
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,672
That's my a lake

534
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,488
Before we get all excited about this technology

535
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,536
Which I do hold you or

536
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
RAB

537
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
Fitbit

538
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
Has a Duo device

539
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,984
Reduce the Fitbit charge 3

540
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
Which

541
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
I'm excited about

542
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,848
Because I have a charge 2

543
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,896
I love it I wear it almost everyday

544
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:17,504
But I don't wear it it means I'm losing with my best friend cuz we have a competition going on

545
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,296
Who can burn the most calories in

546
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
Take the most steps

547
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:26,976
So I think I might get this I'm going to be due for a new Fitbit probably in six months or so this one goes on sale after

548
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
First

549
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
I might pick it up

550
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:33,888
This one is $150 I don't know what you paid for your charge 2

551
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,544
As far as what you're going to get if you do upgrade

552
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,944
You will get app notifications what you don't currently get on your charge 2 I'm sure that's optional if you don't want them

553
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
Not

554
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,248
Easy to no problem

555
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,320
I thought I would think you would because you don't carry your phone

556
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:58,720
More often than not and as long as you're in range of Bluetooth of your phone you would get notifications I could be a poor

557
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,632
What's eating out

558
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:10,496
Applications are actually useful for me because when I'm not near my phone

559
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:15,104
Animal my Apple watch and you pay me via Hangouts chat which happens we talk during the week

560
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:20,992
A chat on hangouts rather I get that on my watch has a notification and I know that you have a question I can even see the question

561
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,320
And so the question you don't know I'm not far

562
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,112
Computer you can't do that

563
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
I don't know

564
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:32,000
Okay I don't want to know when Kevin wants to know something

565
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,048
Really need to get me you should probably

566
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
Or you should actually

567
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,632
Or

568
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
Hack into my WiFi

569
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,984
System and dim my Philips lights

570
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:48,640
Yeah okay so Stacy isn't one of notifications but everybody else can get them on the charge 3

571
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,736
On your charge 2 you have an OLED display that you can tap

572
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,272
I know the charge because they

573
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:58,624
Touch screen so I can you can do more than just tap and you can scroll around a little bit easier which is

574
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
Probably better navigation

575
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:06,560
You can't go swimming with your charge 2 cuz it's splash-resistant charge 3 is water resistant up to 50m

576
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
Kneaders so if you can scuba diving

577
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
You know With The Stingrays

578
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,656
That's useful

579
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:16,032
You should get 7 Days on the charge 3 what do you get on your charge 2 right now

580
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,080
Roughly actually I get about for 2

581
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
Depending on how much

582
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,712
Bright and that you don't get app notifications that's even

583
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,504
That's helping your battery life to I'm sure

584
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
Yes

585
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Since I'm such a curmudgeon

586
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Who hate us

587
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
Yes so I'm

588
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
I'm all in on the

589
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Arnott

590
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,048
Because I need

591
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,656
GPS on my wearable because I run everyday and I need to track her

592
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
How far in Payson

593
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,728
Splits and so on and so forth

594
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:52,128
So you can do heart rate on the charge devices which I can do on my Apple watch but I have a built-in GPS as well

595
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
And

596
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,688
This has a GPS

597
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
It's not a cyst it's connect

598
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,784
Is your phone

599
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,088
Yeah you can I was like you can get that huge

600
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
I don't want to run with my phone

601
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,232
So I don't run with my phone

602
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,584
So yeah and you know Kevin and I were talking about

603
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,144
What you want cuz there's a lot of options out there in the

604
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,216
Instatracker / Smartwatch / whatever world

605
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,568
And it's kind of nice to say you know what I really need GPS cuz that's going to narrow your

606
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
Options

607
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
Considerably

608
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,664
Very quickly yes for me I want deep

609
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,248
Sleep tracking stats and I also for some reason I'm obsessed

610
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
So those are

611
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,952
And I get that I mean I would never pick a device for you and vice versa

612
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,768
You know what I want what I want and need someone so forth but

613
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,352
A lot of people might be saying why aren't you running with us because

614
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:49,216
If you have a problem you need to call somebody in emergency that's another factor that

615
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
You should consider

616
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
I opted

617
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,056
Did for the LTE version of the Apple watch

618
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,872
So my family can call me text me

619
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,176
I can call them an emergency

620
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:02,016
I can call the police very quickly with the SOS feature and my

621
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,320
Peeps can find me on find my friends

622
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
Because when I leave the home

623
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,416
That starts tracking to watch not my phone

624
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
Oh and I should tell everybody

625
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
Remember back in the day

626
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280

Get on the Fitbit charge 3

630
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:24,544
We are the pedal ones that we have not seen for a while so you know if that's true that you can actually get

631
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,616
Just out there it's still lives

632
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384

Smoove on to just a little congratulatory note

635
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528

We follow Cee Pro

637
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,368

00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,640
Had a lot of fun I'm not going

650
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,432

Kevin Stacy my name is Mark Butler come from Cleveland Ohio

699
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,640
My question revolves around

700
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
Trying to track

701
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,224
When one of my children arrives

702
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,504
Or leaves home

703
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,296
I know there's a smart things

704
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
Sensor

705
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,624
So you can do but that's something I guess you made it look like

706
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,696
Sharing The Backpacker here am looking for something that might

707
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,464
Work with

708
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
Location of the song

709
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:56,352
Ridin through my wink Hub or buy Amazon Echo

710
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
Ecosystem

711
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,912
Could be possible

712
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,984
Feel like it's the Holy Grail I've been doing some errands

713
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,032
Thanks so much guys. The podcast

714
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,056
You should be doing twice a week

715
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:11,200
Oh mark this is an eminently reasonable request and you can do it so many ways we can

716
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,272
Can I tell you how to do it

717
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296
Free to

718
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
Oh my God now I'm buying it

719
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,624
Entire home security system

720
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
Let's get started with three

721
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
Because we all

722
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
10

723
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,488
You want to start with the iPhone version

724
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,792
So I don't know which

725
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,328
Phone platform

726
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,352
Mark and his kids

727
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
Have

728
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:29,888
AR

729
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,448
And is to use the find my friends with you

730
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,216
Your family

731
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
That is free

732
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,776
If you're on iOS

733
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,104
There are downsides right off the bat when you

734
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,456
Set up a notification for let's say notify me when my kids

735
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
Come home

736
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,992
Basically

737
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,784
When I come home you'll get a message

738
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,832
The problem is it's a one-and-done thing

739
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
So I don't recommend it

740
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,648
Turn all the time you

741
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:57,792
But it is possible to do if your on iPhone you could do it also on Android they have a similar feature

742
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
With Google

743
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,096
Maps sharing

744
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,400
I'm not used it for notifications though

745
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,424
It's more of a

746
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,448
Looking

747
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
Where people are in a set

748
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,568
You may be able to notification I have not tried it yet but those are two

749
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,616
Options not ideal but could work

750
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
But

751
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,176
Still keeping with the

752
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,248
Free but now we've got maybe some more ideal stuff

753
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,552
You can actually put if

754
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
Service that

755
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,136
Ties web services together

756
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
On your handset

757
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,720
Be there a iOS or Android

758
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,048
And you would put it on your kids phones to and you would actually

759
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,584
Create applets

760
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,632
It would say when this phone

761
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
Either geo-fenced

762
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,728
Or gets into connect to the

763
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,752
Home Wi-Fi

764
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
Get a notify

765
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,800
Vacation so then you get it

766
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
Like a text

767
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
So

768
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
That is free

769
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
Your kids do have to have that on their phone

770
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,712
So this is not surreptitious but

771
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
Your kids probably know that you're trying

772
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
When they come here

773
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:57,440
I wonder though is there a trigger event for when somebody leaves the Wi-Fi network because Mark wants to track the arrival

774
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
DeLand

775
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
Departure

776
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:06,656
I think there must be an Android I believe there is because I have one when I leave

777
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
My phone

778
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,216
Android phone leaves the Wi-Fi net

779
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,776
That's a trigger that I can use to take certain

780
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
Actions

781
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
The natural work

782
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
That also means

783
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,152
When

784
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,944
Your kids turn off the Wi-Fi net

785
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
For whatever reason

786
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
You're going to get a

787
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,320
Gravely disabled WiFi radio that's correct

788
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
So

789
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,136
If you want to move up a layer

790
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,440
There's a couple options you can add

791
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,976
Camera with facial recognition

792
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:35,072
Ignition so doorbell cameras I actually have a doorbell camera the nest

793
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
That recognizes

794
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,168
People in my home and when I walked by it there like

795
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
And I just passed the door

796
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,008
Or you know they say Anna's home

797
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:43,776
So

798
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,640
So this is good if you don't have

799
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
A camera in front of every door that you

800
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
Your kids are going to use

801
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,808
And that may include a subscription fee I'm thinking Nest aware

802
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,880
10 bucks a month

803
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
Another option

804
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,232
Is you just have a nest camera and like facing

805
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,792
The front area or an area that you're

806
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
Your kids have to pass through

807
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,608
And you'll get the same sort of in

808
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:12,192
Information that you get a notification that movement has been detected

809
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:17,824
And you can go back into the nest app and look and see what the movement was in there for you could then see

810
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,384
Who is it and which were they going in around Etc

811
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,456
Slightly more proactive options include

812
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,552
Lighthouse camera where you can say tell me if you see my kids

813
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,112
Which is kind of fun

814
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,928
But it's pricey and that actually has a subscription

815
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
And

816
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
If

817
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,280
You're worried about like your kids sneaking out

818
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:43,936
We're trying to figure out every possible about your kids sneaking out my assumption is you're going to want install

819
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,704
Call something on there

820
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,984
Their phone that's going to

821
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,056
Biggio fence to your location or your Wi-Fi network

822
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,336
Cuz they're not going to leave without their

823
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,152
Right I actually have the canary

824
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,224
System which you can find now on some decent discount

825
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,248
Quite honestly

826
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:03,648
I think I paid 179 or 199 for the base camera and one extension camera cuz I got it free

827
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,584
There you go again not for you but not too expensive either and it's the home security camera system it also measures

828
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,984
Air quality in your home but it also does the geofencing for you as long as everyone in the family has the canoe

829
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,872
Canary app installed and they actually want that installs I'll tell you why because when they come home if the alarm is

830
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,712
Active on the canary they can disable it on their phone before they walk in the door

831
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,552
Otherwise you may have a siren go off where you may have a police get called back

832
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,600
System so we have

833
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:37,440
The geofencing it set up so every time somebody in my home

834
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,328
Leaves the geofence area or arrives I literally get a notification on my Apple watch and on my phone that

835
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
So and so is home

836
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,888
So-and-so has left

837
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:49,984
So that's exactly what you want Mark and then again there's a cost

838
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,848
And there's a subscription it's 999 a month I had pay for I think the two cameras but

839
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,640
It has the geofencing which is

840
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,456
Probably the best way to go if you don't mind spending a little money

841
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
Markdown options

842
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,552
Options for you

843
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,832
Various price ranges

844
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
And I'm sure actually

845
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
That we didn't eat

846
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Oh yeah

847
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
I would try the free option

848
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:15,072
Tiffany work for you and which case you know you don't have to spend any extra money

849
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,888
Good luck and now stay tuned

850
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,936
For our guests who is

851
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,264
Tyler Baker the CTO at foundries

852
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,360
Which is a new company that's launching

853
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,384
Iot

854
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,784
Security platform will talk more about that after the break we are taking a

855
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,648
Break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week

856
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
Netgear

857
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:44,768
And we have John McHugh who is general manager of commercial networking

858
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,816
At Nick here here to talk to us

859
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:52,960
We've been talking a lot about how Netgear has adapted the inside line for the internet of things and no

860
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
You guys allow

861
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:59,104
Companies to control their power over ethernet devices over the inside line

862
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,640
Do you want to dig into that a bit

863
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,920
The Internet of Things

864
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,968
And appeal we

865
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
We are like

866
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,320
Perfect companions one of the things that has more people

867
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,880
Putting out Solutions like monitoring

868
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,440
Cameras or security lock

869
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,720
Or

870
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,488
Speaker

871
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,792
Various other Internet of Things

872
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,328
Controllers and monitor

873
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,120
Defining one of the

874
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
Wonderful attributes

875
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,936
Network connect

876
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,264
Wired network connection is you can power that device

877
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,824
No having to worry about batteries and other things

878
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,408
You can power it with a cable that's easy to run and doesn't

879
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:38,528
Represent an electrical shock hazard or require a specialized person to install a

880
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:42,880
What and so what this means is it's kind of a do-it-yourself thing where you at this

881
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,672
DC driven power

882
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:51,072
It is now making all of your internet stuff operate there's a lot of efficiencies around this one of them is if you can

883
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
Power your network

884
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:58,496
Would like a backup generator in the case of an emergency all of these devices are going to function as well

885
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
Off the same

886
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,800
Network cabling

887
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
So what I found most interesting

888
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
About

889
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:07,968
Your control of power over ethernet devices was actually that it's not just control

890
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,784
You let customers handle automation tasks

891
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
Stutter normally handle

892
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,344
Completely different software

893
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
Can you talk about that

894
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,208
We knew when we were looking at the application so we're going to run on the

895
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,512
News networks that this power thing was

896
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,072
Very fertile ground and if you look at most

897
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
Competitor

898
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Devices out there

899
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
I mean I'll let you turn power on

900
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
They let you turn power off

901
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,264
We thought a lot about what how customers work

902
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
Going to use this

903
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,592
And softly created a bunch of features

904
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:38,432
To enable the models that we thought sit with these devices

905
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:44,832
For example I can power cycle apart so right it's not turning it off and then waiting and then turn it back on

906
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
Push a button

907
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,136
A power cycle

908
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,208
That's something we need to do to remote devices

909
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,256
Regularly is part of the troubleshooting

910
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,304
Process the other thing is people said

911
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,096
Going to be really cool if I could just

912
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,632
Turn off my WiFi

913
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:04,288
I mean turn it completely off from when I leave at the end of the day till the next morning what could be more so

914
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
Secure the net

915
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
So you can

916
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,896
Schedule that your all your power devices are certain

917
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,456
Shut down a certain time

918
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:17,856
Turn on when you show up the next day at work and so it provides you with this level of Direct Control and phone

919
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:22,208
Functionality to frankly standard Solutions in Computer Solutions just don't have

920
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,024
Where can we go to find out more about the in

921
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,632
Www.netgear.com

922
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,168

923
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:43,968
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

924
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,784
And today's guest is Tyler Baker who is

925
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
CTO at

926
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,832
Foundries

927
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
Dot IO

928
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,904
Hi Tyler how are you doing

929
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,696
I'm doing well Stacy how about yourself

930
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
Great

931
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,768
I almost said Lennar okay

932
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,816
Cuz that's where half of you guys are from but

933
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
You guys

934
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,888
Just launched your company this week

935
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
Quickly

936
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
Let's

937
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,704
Talk about

938
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,496
Just very briefly what you're trying to

939
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:13,408
So we're building a secure iot platform they can be leveraged by many many customers and

940
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,432
The idea is that is

941
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,992
Is minimal and is updatable

942
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,040
And we have a couple different platform

943
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
1 for a deeply embedded

944
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:27,488
And the other one would be for the nice class devices

945
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,768
Okay

946
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,584
So for some of us were like why what was that

947
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,376
So let's talk about stories for

948
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,400
What

949
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,680
Is the problem you are trying

950
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,448
How to solve

951
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,728
That is a great

952
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,776
Really what we're trying to solve

953
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,848
Is distributed denial-of-service attack

954
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,896
That's have a higher bandwidth

955
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,944
Throughput and we never seen before some even

956
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,064
And where they're coming from our compromise iot

957
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,368
Cameras but it

958
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,136
Router

959
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,608
Providing a

960
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,168
People or companies that would like to build IO

961
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,728
And allowing them to be

962
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
Sure

963
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,032
And allowing them to have

964
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,312
Update capabilities

965
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,712
Security is our biggest concern and being able

966
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:23,040
To have the latest software available for a customer

967
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,904
Let's talk about

968
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,672
What it take

969
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,720
Cakes to create a secure iot

970
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,024
Because that's the everybody's in gold

971
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,816
Let's make this more secure

972
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,864
So what are the steps that need

973
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,656
What is the bare minimum

974
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,984
Yes

975
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,288
Images

976
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:48,128
Cryptographically sign

977
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,200
Image into a device

978
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
The second thing is

979
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,320
The solution that is provided needs to be threat models

980
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,136
Innocence that we identify the attack vector

981
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,416
And we decide which

982
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,464
Tigers are not in scope

983
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:07,328
And the ones that are in scope we model them and we say here's the medication

984
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,936
So we're under the impression that our software offering here is

985
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,496
Completely secure in fact I don't believe any software

986
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,312
D'usse is

987
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:18,848
We use

988
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:24,224
The Upstream software and we basically

989
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
Continuously

990
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,528
If you want to look at something like

991
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,368
Spectre meltdown bug

992
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,160
Turtle very quickly

993
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,744
However with older LTS kernel

994
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
You can use

995
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
Many many weeks

996
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,096
Is distribution

997
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:44,448
Should be updated which means a lot of the cloud

998
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,984
Inspector

999
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,824
So our goal is to provide the latest software that's

1000
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,967
Imitation

1001
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,903
Is transmitting data to an educate way

1002
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,975
So that sounds good I understand the kind of

1003
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,559
Platform that's always updated with the latest most secure

1004
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
Version

1005
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,095
Of the software

1006
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,631
But you guys are

1007
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,935
You're supporting a bunch of different versions of soft

1008
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,751
Because you've got your artists you've got basic Linux

1009
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,287
And then you've got container

1010
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Focused

1011
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
Locations so

1012
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
Explain how all of that

1013
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895
Works together

1014
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:31,551
What we do is we are actually we work Upstream with those projects a lot of us on the team or maintainers at them so we have a good

1015
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,927
Advantage

1016
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:44,095
Able to understand what's very important

1017
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,655
Security patches

1018
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,423
So

1019
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,471
Wallets very complex systems

1020
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
We have

1021
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,055
I believe the right expertise in the right places

1022
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,103
To help us achieve these goals

1023
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,175
So let's talk about this from the perspective of someone building a

1024
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,967
If I'm making a lipo

1025
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,015
I need to put your Zephyr

1026
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
Artist

1027
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:03,807
Micro plaits

1028
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:04,831
On the way

1029
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
And then

1030
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,415
I got to put your Linux micro platform

1031
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,487
It's going to be on the Hub or Gateway that

1032
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,767
Stocking a lightbulb and then

1033
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
Talks to the Wi-Fi

1034
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,607
And then if I got servers running in the cloud

1035
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,423
That's also going to have the Linux micro platform on it

1036
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:26,079
So none of those pieces have to be there you could use the platform independently of our Linux microphone

1037
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,431
The way we've designed the software stack

1038
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:33,759
Is that there is no law on open source projects

1039
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:40,159
If you choose to use the micro popcorn and maybe you've developed a proprietary Gateway standard

1040
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,463
TT

1041
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,767
All your educate Wings Temple Modesto

1042
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,887
We use standard there as well

1043
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
To allow people

1044
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,679
Plugged in

1045
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
Any clubs

1046
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,775
It really depends on the use case and where you see

1047
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,871
Ideally we'd love you to run

1048
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,639
Okay

1049
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,199
So talk to me about how I would make

1050
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:03,967
This decision

1051
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,527
Because actually first tell me your Revenue

1052
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,831
So am I being charged

1053
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,367
For every version of the micro platform

1054
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,439
No sew you paid sensually a year lease

1055
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,999
Army Zephyr micro platform

1056
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,791
It is $10,000 a year

1057
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,839
And there's no per unit

1058
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,887
So it is a per product

1059
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,191
If you have a stalker build let's say

1060
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,567
Light bulb

1061
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,151
Hardware that is only

1062
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,319
It's $25,000 a year

1063
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,087
Steampunk

1064
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,391
What is it is a paper product

1065
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,511
Okay so then what are the trade-offs and reasons I might run it on the edge

1066
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,559
So on the light bulb versus on the

1067
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,583
The Gateway or

1068
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
So what would I do

1069
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,167
Is we realize that

1070
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,703
The enterprise software Concepts

1071
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,495
Updating your software

1072
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,287
Using containers in virtual machine

1073
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,335
Is really good practices

1074
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,895
These concepts are widely known by developers in

1075
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:11,807
When you go to embedded it's kind of a choose-your-own-adventure

1076
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,599
Beyond the Edge

1077
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,879
We can standardize

1078
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,415
Some of the stuff for deployment

1079
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,207
And the way people deployed harappa

1080
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,487
Locations to the edge

1081
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:23,071
Using containers using virtual machines and using tools at the Enterprise

1082
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
Already

1083
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:29,471
You don't have to learn new tools or create your own

1084
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,263
Already managing Enterprise

1085
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,031
Trucks today

1086
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,847
Okay so one of the challenges with

1087
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,895
Connected devices is

1088
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,943
Companies don't tend to

1089
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,711
Update them

1090
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:43,807
Forever right I might expect something to sit on my factory floor for like

1091
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
20 years

1092
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:49,183
Or even Thirty but the idea of supporting software for that long is just

1093
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,231
Anathema to the IT guy

1094
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,255
So

1095
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,559
With your experience from the embedded world

1096
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,583
Is this product

1097
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
Going to

1098
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,119
Help

1099
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,143
Solve those kind of

1100
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,191
I believe it is

1101
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,263
Intestinal problems

1102
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,287
Just an industry

1103
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:07,615
I think there's a two ways how this product helps

1104
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:11,455
Enterprise developers that want to maintain a product or

1105
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,527
Building Products

1106
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,879
Especially when they're based on movies open source projects like Linux

1107
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,671
And you're probably

1108
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,207
You're onto the next project

1109
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,511
Working on

1110
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,303
There's no time for you to really

1111
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,327
Keep up-to-date

1112
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,911
What's happening of streaming the security things that are Basics there

1113
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,471
So what we provide

1114
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,799
What is a summary every 3 days every 5 days

1115
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,663
Where are small bits of information that are easily digestible

1116
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,735
30 minutes and understand what's happening

1117
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
Software

1118
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,111
The second part of that is

1119
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,647
We're doing a lot of fasting

1120
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,671
Internally

1121
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,999
And our partners also do a lot of testing and feed the results back

1122
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:00,351
As the suffers moving forward it ideally it gets better and that's how it's

1123
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,167
But we're constantly offering update

1124
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,727
You have the Machinery that's on

1125
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,263
Automation floor where

1126
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:12,383
Processor like a consumer device like a refrigerator or a light bulb

1127
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,687
Necessarily the companies don't need to update it

1128
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:18,271
Because there's no exploit but what an exploit is found in their product

1129
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,807
They want to be able to make a move

1130
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:23,135
Latest software

1131
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:23,903
Updates

1132
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:30,303
So they can make it there right now

1133
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,119
So if I'm using something like this

1134
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,423
My device isn't automatically

1135
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,983
Secured I still need to handle basic cracked

1136
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:44,895
Encryption between

1137
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,711
Storing data in database

1138
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,575
Provide

1139
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,111
We've done that like work for you

1140
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,927
So we provide dtls on the

1141
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,255
And we use mqtt S

1142
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,023
Between

1143
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,303
In device

1144
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,191
And the Gateway rain so we're able to show you this is how you use encryption to move your data from the edge

1145
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,215
To the cloud

1146
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
And provide you the best price

1147
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,103
And we

1148
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,223
So when it comes to security

1149
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
One of the challenges is

1150
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,551
Is that a lot of these companies

1151
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,599
456 years down the line

1152
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,927
They don't have the infrastructure to track and monitor

1153
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:32,767
Hey what's happening in the security World in their exploits

1154
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:39,423
They don't actually know how to track without in the world and actually roll out the security updates to it so it's

1155
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,959
Still a pretty complex

1156
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,983
Big thing

1157
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,751
To ask

1158
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,775
A manufacturer

1159
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:46,079
To take on security so do you guys kind of

1160
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,359
Help absolve them

1161
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:51,455
Yeah I think you're absolutely right so for your question a

1162
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
Do provide

1163
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,759
All the information

1164
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,551
On a regular basis about this

1165
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,367
Security exploits and the fixes that are going into our platform

1166
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,415
So you're at least notified at that

1167
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,255
If you still have it

1168
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,983
Practice this weather that security or opens for soccer practice

1169
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,799
They have

1170
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,127
Nothing else to do other unresearched

1171
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,663
They're able to Leverage

1172
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,223
We built and built on top of that as part of their

1173
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:29,087
All of the software that we provide

1174
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,391
Is open

1175
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:39,583
Able to cancel it anytime

1176
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:45,471
So if they decide that they want to take on managing

1177
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,799
Create appointment

1178
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:55,199
All right so let's talk about other security efforts so you mentioned things like you have to have a secure Boot and this is not something you guys

1179
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,503
Provide this is something the underlying Hardware that

1180
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,783
You choose should have

1181
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
Correct

1182
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:03,391
Don't let friends do have cryptographic managers that store keys

1183
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:06,207
Write a we will our software will allow

1184
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
Product makers

1185
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,023
Use that those Hardware devices

1186
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,727
Those are the security measures that benefit the low level

1187
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,287
Assurance

1188
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:28,223
And send them at the edge

1189
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,015
How much overhead do you guys need in

1190
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,343
Yeah so where does that

1191
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,159
In Our Lifetime we need to optimize

1192
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:42,047
Yet we plan on offering multiple flavors something

1193
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,191
It doesn't like 500

1194
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:52,287
And then the image that we provide today is kind of got everything

1195
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,079
Things like that is right around

1196
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:59,967
For most applications but the

1197
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,503
The way to configure alcohol

1198
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,527
The extra stuff

1199
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,391
Designer

1200
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
Cytosine

1201
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,023
Har Ram

1202
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,815
And a really minimal not a slash

1203
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,407
And that they can be verified by the bootloader and then booted

1204
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,991
So we're working on optimizing it there or not

1205
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,831
Our customers guide us there

1206
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,879
Thank you so much this was super helpful

1207
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,415
Tyler thanks so much for

1208
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:47,583
AC not a problem enjoy it

1209
