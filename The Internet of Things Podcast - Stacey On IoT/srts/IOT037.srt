00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,520
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,544
This is your house

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,848
Stacey Higginbotham and your co-host

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
Kevin tofel

5
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,432
And today we have a Whopper of a show

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,712
We really do

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,272
I think it's going to be kind of late

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,552
A downer of a show

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,856
I was just going to say that if you are

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:31,744
Expecting something peppy and bright and cheerful for the holidays were acting to start off with some not-so-happy stuff

11
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:37,632
Yeah I'll do it if you want I'll sing a song we can we can have a cheerful holiday rendition of like Deck the Halls

12
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
Later on

13
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,472
Or or an item

14
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,544
It's the truth but I'm still listening

15
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
Well

16
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,360
Okay

17
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,152
So let's get started with

18
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,432
Earlier this week

19
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,456
Start with my

20
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,504
Instigation

21
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,784
I caused it

22
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,368
Stacy is the IRT instigator of things

23
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,720
So I tweeted this week that my nest

24
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,792
Was roasting my family in the middle of the night

25
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,560
In

26
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:11,424
It's true it is what's happening is for the last about six weeks

27
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,240
On random nights but usually on the weekend

28
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,776
My Nest Thermostat

29
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
Which is upstairs

30
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
Is

31
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
Turning on and confusing my summertime air conditioning settings with my winter time heat setting

32
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,808
So instead of keeping it like 68

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,344
At night for heat

34
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,648
It is turning it up to 76

35
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,464
Switches what we have it set for AC in the middle

36
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
Summer

37
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,048
So like at 4 in the morning

38
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
I wake up and I'm like

39
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
Oh my God

40
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
I am dehydrating

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
Sona mode

42
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
Yes but it

43
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
A dry heat

44
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,896
It's pretty bad last weekend this happened and it woke my daughter up

45
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,944
It usually prompts a migraine in me

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,016
And my husband would probably sleep through it only I am

47
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,808
Highly dramatic and so I

48
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
Wake up in

49
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,392
Like I said of throwing off the covers and I'm like oh my God

50
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
And this time my daughter did wake up

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
Like an hour or so

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,048
I was a little cranky and I fired off at

53
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
What's open late to eat

54
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
It's a polite

55
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
Yeah I was like

56
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Nest

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
What's happening you're roasting my family I think a hard reset is the only way to go

58
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
I heard from like

59
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,616
4 people maybe five

60
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
Maybe 6 I don't

61
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,504
They're also having this issue and I also more importantly heard from dust

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
Instead they will they help me troubleshoot

63
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
So

64
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
Which is good that they're monitoring

65
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Twitter

66
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
They are Fitness is good and I did at nest

67
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,536
Right so a couple things to know

68
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
1

69
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
I did look at my schedule

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
To make sure that

71
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
I wasn't

72
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
You don't like

73
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
I didn't have it set on my skin

74
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,008
Retinue

75
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
I actually this is

76
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,872
Been going on for a while and I had been resetting it back hoping

77
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
To teach the nest

78
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
I didn't want this to happen

79
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
My heat settings

80
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,624
I'm so I had been actually playing by The Nest rules for a couple weeks and that just wasn't

81
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
So with that in mind

82
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
Polite

83
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
Height of discombobulated tweet later

84
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:17,120
I heard back from nest and they asked me for some information

85
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
About my account

86
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,704
If I was using any works with Nest program

87
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
And

88
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
Yes I was

89
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
They pinpointed the issue

90
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
As being something with

91
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,640
It's works with Nest specifically

92
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,200
It looks like they decided it was my

93
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
My MyQ my Chamberlain MyQ settings

94
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,832
Your garage door opener is messing up your thermostat

95
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Just what the

96
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
They said

97
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,488
I'm raising an eyebrow I know nobody can see it but I'm sitting here with my face

98
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:49,376
Yes so that they asked me the question I asked was do you have any worse with Nest products or service

99
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:54,240
You do would it be all right for me to check your account activity log to see if they could be adjusting the nest

100
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Best temperature

101
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,568
So first of all I want to give them huge crops

102
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
For asking

103
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Like all kinds

104
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
The permissions before they go

105
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,456
Skip and being very specific and what they are

106
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
So yes they did that

107
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
They decided that

108
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,320
They implicated the MyQ home

109
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Control settings

110
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
And they asked me

111
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Turn off

112
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
Maya Maya

113
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,768
Control arm IQ

114
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
Works with Nest integration

115
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
And I did that

116
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,399
I also got with the MyQ

117
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
Soak City

118
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,239
And I was like hey whatsup

119
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,847
Hey we're looking into this too cuz this is strange and you know this is hard

120
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:36,223
Making things work together on the back end while making it really super easy

121
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
For the front end

122
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,295
It's hard I don't disagree with that

123
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,087
The sawed off the top of my head

124
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Is that

125
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:49,023
It's really mess that's in charge of everything that's going on with the nest because it's their API that gets used in the

126
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
Words for death program

127
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
And I can't imagine that

128
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,167
Non Nest devices

129
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,239
Call go take control of a nest and make changes

130
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,287
Ness would take information maybe

131
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,847
And perhaps do something but

132
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,639
I'm not following

133
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
The thought process here from The Nest box

134
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,551
So I talked to a lot of developers about working with

135
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
And

136
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
Most of them say

137
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:19,231
When they choose to work with Nest or some of them say they've chosen not to work

138
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:24,351
With nest because it's one of the companies out there with the most restrictive partnership program

139
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
So

140
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,215
It doesn't allow companies to take data from

141
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Nest

142
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,799
It doesn't allow companies to really

143
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,151
Interact with the nest API you can only

144
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,943
Give Nest information

145
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
You can't really take in

146
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Information from

147
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
Has been

148
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,367
I really should be I think, I have no problem with that

149
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
So

150
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
Kind of makes me question

151
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
How old am IQ

152
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
Which

153
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,583
Can tell the way the MyQ setting works right now

154
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
With my garage door opener

155
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Is

156
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,447
It can tell the it based on me

157
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:05,055
You know opening and closing the garage door it tells the nest if I'm home or away

158
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,127
Now at 4 in the morning on

159
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
The weekends or

160
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Saturday in this

161
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,247
I'm not actually opening or closing

162
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
My garage door

163
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
It doesn't actually mean any

164
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
Cuz buggy software

165
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:23,743
True it could be that my cue software is sending off a trigger event that you didn't actually do

166
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Possible

167
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
But

168
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
My understanding of how these things

169
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,119
It's work is that it would just be saying

170
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Hadoop

171
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
The garage door opened

172
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
Stacy Lattisaw

173
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
You could go to a wedding

174
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,055
And then ask it's to say

175
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
All right what do I want to do with that

176
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
In this case the nest is saying

177
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
How can I turn the

178
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,991
All the way up

179
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,623
Will you know it is winter time and maybe thinks you left the garage door open I don't know

180
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,671
Letter fry

181
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
So

182
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,047
I still have my face on because

183
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
Something is not jiving

184
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,887
Compared to the bottom of it but

185
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Again

186
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,495
You provide apis so that way you have control over things

187
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
And

188
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Unless

189
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,127
Somebody's using a nest API in a way that Ness has

190
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,943
Planned for I'm just not seeing it

191
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
Chamberlain is going to get back to

192
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
Hopefully we'll get back

193
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
Hopefully

194
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,671
This weekend I will not be roasted out of my bed

195
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
5 -

196
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:33,119
Yeah I have to say I have a question because a couple people did respond or tweet saying they are having similar problems with their nest

197
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,727
Did any of them say they have any other devices I'm just curious

198
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:43,871
Who is experiencing the same problem and they don't have a mic

199
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
That changes things

200
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:54,111
I'm so I was going to say guys who are listening who have a nest thermostat

201
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,927
Email me info at iot podcast

202
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Do you have an S

203
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
Are you having a similar issue

204
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,559
Do you have other works with nest

205
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
Problems

206
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Because

207
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
This kind of seems

208
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,471
Something

209
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
There's a bear there

210
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:17,407
There is I am trying to recall I don't think it's all that long ago when a firmware update we're not to the mess I'm not trying to pin pointer pointer

211
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
Fingers here I'm not saying that's what it is

212
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
I'm just trying to

213
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
Consider all the potential

214
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
Potential root causes here

215
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,343
It wasn't that long ago

216
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,951
Have you been how long have you been having this problem just out of curiosity

217
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
So winter in Texas

218
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
Is

219
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
Not really

220
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,399
Devastating so I don't think we turned on or heater until sometime towards the end of October

221
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
So not until

222
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
Not until we turned on our heater

223
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
So yes

224
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,359
Whatever that happen

225
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
You know

226
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,967
Again this is one of those things where

227
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
You know the nest is

228
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
One it's irritating

229
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
2

230
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,671
This is costing me money because

231
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,511
It's expensive and it happens you know once maybe twice a week but

232
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,095
Running your thermostat up to 76 degrees in the middle of winter is

233
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,935
And when you're asleep you don't actually notice until it starts getting

234
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Real hot

235
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
And

236
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
Waking up my kid

237
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
Not fun

238
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
Triggering a migraine

239
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
Really not

240
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,223
I'll be curious to see what the end result is assuming wanted

241
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
When is found

242
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,087
Ultimately I say that again I'm not trying to point fingers

243
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,391
But the way this whole platform is set up

244
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,695
Nest has to own the works with Nest program

245
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Ivory

246
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,255
I want to hear back

247
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
I want to understand

248
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
And

249
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,143
At the end of the day this has to be something that Nest solves

250
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
For not just me

251
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:51,615
Imagine you know people don't have your contacts in this industry Avenue been able to reach out to a bunch of companies here

252
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
But yeah Joe Schmo off the street

253
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,247
Just going to sit there and scratches head contact Nest support and

254
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
Things get workout

255
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
And a lot of people are like well I'm going to buy a

256
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
I'm going to buy an ecobee

257
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,999
We'll talk about that in a second but you know spending $250 on a thermostat

258
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,863
Then having to rip it out of the wall by another connected thermostat or just

259
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,167
Staying screwing

260
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Got the answer

261
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
That's a really crappy

262
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Decision

263
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
Speaking of the ecobee

264
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
Yeah

265
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
Kevin you want to talk about what

266
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
Well

267
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:32,063
I don't because it's more bad news but I will now this is not a problem that you are I have had I do not have actually

268
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
Abaniko pig11 s

269
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
Which is working fine

270
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
For the record

271
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:42,047
But apparently Reddit a few days ago somebody posted at their ecobee3 remote sensor was

272
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
Wasn't detecting occupancy

273
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,375
So

274
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
They reached out to ecobee support

275
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
And I hope you're sitting down folks

276
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
Ecobee Support Center

277
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:56,895
Take one of the sensors apart and see if the motion sensor which is a small circular pillar with a little plate

278
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Kinda like a solar panel

279
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,503
To see that it's a line properly with the little window on the front

280
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
It turns out it wasn't

281
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,647
So is person check his other two sensors and they were on wrong as well

282
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
All three are fixed so that's the good news

283
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,767
And the information is out there publicly available to the other two

284
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,631
Search for this type of problem we're on ecobee3 is not detecting occupancy

285
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:23,519
You just learned that hey if you kind of take this little bit of part and you can rely on the sensor of your okay

286
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
Not great but you know what

287
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,711
At least it's an easy fix it's something that once you have the information you know you have you how to fix it and can fix it

288
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,015
So good on ecobee to actually say

289
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,855
Hey you know what we think this might be the problem can you check it out and sure enough it was

290
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
So there you go and you know

291
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,951
Ecobee3 is actually

292
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
When is the product

293
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
I have an ecobee SI downstairs

294
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:51,679
I really like my ecobee I'd love to get an ecobee3 but I can't really justify spending $750 on 3rd

295
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,703
Thermostats in my house

296
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,751
Gwine to run all night

297
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,775
Well yeah

298
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Well

299
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847
If I if I do give up the nest this is

300
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,895
The ecobee3 is actually the

301
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Thermostat for me

302
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
Although I will have to check my okapi

303
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,039
Okay moving right along

304
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Guess

305
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831

311
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047

It's going to continue I ask him about the product roadmap they're not ready to talk about that until after

327
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
Because

328
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
They just closed

329

So this is this is good news for everybody wink is actually hiring

333
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,783
So you know if you've got some

334
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
Crazy mad

335
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Iot skills

336
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
You don't hey

337
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,671
, anyway so

338
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Nice

339
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
The good news out of this is

340
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,535
The wink is planning to continue

341
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
Its investment in

342
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Both

343
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
Help desk functions adding

344
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Devices

345
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Also

346
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,287
By having flex and I keep calling at Flextronics so if you hear that please

347
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,335
Mentally correct it to flask

348
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Because Flex

349
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,175
Tronix became Flex earlier this year

350
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,247
And I know I've covered Flex 4

351
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
Like over a decade

352
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
And vibrates just knock

353
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:49,183
Flexes I used to be just a contract manufacturer and now they're like all designed to

354
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,255
Scale so basically they help you build

355
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
Now they help you build products

356
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,911
From start to finish if you're a startup or if you're like

357
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
Nokia

358
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
So this

359
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,663
Changes my potential purchase plans because I was going to buy a SmartThings

360
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
House anthem

361
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
So

362
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:17,599
I've been playing with SmartThings for a while and I hate to do this but SmartThings is turned into an 80%

363
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,647
Isn't it only works 80%

364
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
But we the same even more money

365
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
So

366
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Just

367
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,815
Unless you're cool with it being 84

368
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
No

369
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,935
Okay cuz wink is week is actually becoming more reliable for

370
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,007
SmartThings there still a lot of things I don't like about

371
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,103
The new SmartThings is really only about eighty per

372
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:44,991
You know I think a lot of it will also be dictated by what devices are actually connecting to the hub

373
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:49,343
You got a ton of different things a whole range of devices

374
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,135
Add sensors and so on

375
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,927
I only have the nest

376
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,975
And a whole bunch of

377
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,303
Lights from different companies smart like I don't have any

378
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,095
Door locks or

379
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,447
Other connected appliances and and so on

380
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
Kevin will

381
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
I do.

382
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:12,383
Who put the batteries in and I got it you know locking and unlocking in my

383
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:20,063
But I did not replace it on my front door because we start using the front door that mounts or no

384
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
I can't believe it

385
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
Sorry

386
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Sorry

387
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:31,327
Suicide I do think that may have something to do with you know some of the Hub issues you seen with link that I

388
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Haven't seen

389
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
I don't know

390
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
Yeah

391
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,447
I take the range of stuff

392
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,495
Lights are a premature lights

393
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
You got

394
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:44,127
Motion sensors in your house you've got the warlocks you've got

395
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
Garage door opener right now

396
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,991
You can you have a wider breadth of products

397
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:54,879
10 interesting theories so maybe like the more stuff you have on these things the more likely they are to break

398
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,415
Which is kind of bad news

399
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,463
It would be that would that would be

400
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Bad news for the

401
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
Smart Home in dust

402
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
That was bad

403
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
So

404
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
I don't know what to say there

405
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,399
For the weak people

406
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Good news

407
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
So

408
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,519
And if you're like me and you're running

409
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Two hubs

410
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
Both wink and SmartThings

411
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:20,479
Because I do have a lot of the sensors that I've never enjoyed adding by traditional zigbee kind of sensors

412
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,551
Zigbee and Z-Wave sensors to the wink platform because I don't like

413
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
I haven't really enjoyed the

414
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,671
Weights supports the zigbee and Z-Wave

415
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:32,255
Profiles for devices that it doesn't actually have in its files

416
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,071
Striving more generic type profiles I guess they use

417
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
And I don't

418
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,143
I didn't want to invest in the

419
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
Branded sensors

420
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,239
My thought is I could

421
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
Double up with the Amazon Echo is the controlling device for all of those things but I haven't seen the sensors under the

422
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
Geico yet

423
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Skip

424
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
So maybe it will

425
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,295
I was trying to go to the whole podcast without meds

426
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Oh

427
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
We were so close

428
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:04,511
That's okay. We have to talk about really briefly anyway because last week I had said I would heard of Fire TV

429
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
That's right so talk about your fired

430
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,375
Yes it won't take long cuz everything I said last week

431
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,959
Is pretty much spot-on what I thought it would do it does really really well

432
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
It's

433
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,823
I have a downstairs can I go to a TV obviously it's Fire TV

434
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,871
And I have the voice remote with it

435
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,455
My echo is actually in my

436
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,759
Second floor home office where I am now

437
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:32,159
But it's like having a another echo in the room downstairs maybe cuz you just hold the voice button do you sell your commands and

438
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
It's good to go

439
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
And as I had said on on the show last week

440
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,071
A lot of the informational bits that the echo will provide you

441
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
It reads them aloud

442
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,935
Also put some up on the display the screen I've been on

443
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,007
Make a 60-inch TV that got these ginormous cards

444
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,055
Information when I do a web search

445
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,871
Russia War get the weather or play

446
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,199
Amazon Prime music whatever it is it's all right there visually

447
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:59,551
It is a beautiful thing I did say something last week that I want to correct

448
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,111
I'd said to you Stacey that I'll bet you the

449
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
Amazon Echo remote

450
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,743
The Bluetooth remote is the same as the one that comes with the Fire TV it is not

451
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,839
And that's because there's some additional buttons on the Fire TV remote for playback of

452
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,143
Media which is really what the Fire TV is for

453
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:18,751
However did the integration between the Echo and the Fire TV is outstanding

454
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
Absolutely love it

455
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,615
Sitting in the room watching TV just press the button and tell

456
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,151
She Who Shall Not Be Named to

457
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,735
You know turn the lights down so I can watch TV and it doesn't it's a

458
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
Wonderful

459
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
That sounds awesome

460
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
I was

461
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,927
It was the same do you leave your TV on more now

462
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,231
No I mean there's a lot of

463
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,279
Similar devices like Google Chromecast

464
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,351
Can they have something called letting its whole backdrop where there is a

465
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,631
A screensaver

466
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:52,031
Android information like a local weather that will cycle through if you want to leave your TV on but I'm not big into wasting the energy you know I'm in

467
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
I really try and conserve cuz we're

468
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Generating

469
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,895
Electricity with solar panels I don't want to

470
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
Now I'm just

471
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
You going to let me know

472
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
True

473
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
How's your solar panel

474
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,111
Wonderful we've been thinking a lot of energy this year it's

475
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,183
It's a year-to-year basis May through May is is

476
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
What my electric company

477
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Measures

478
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,047
And I haven't any balance like an overproduced

479
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,583
I get a check from them in May

480
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:19,935
But basically I had almost a full month's worth of electricity

481
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,495
Cortical in the bank with them last month

482
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,311
Used about a third of it this month because it's been

483
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
Shorter Days Inn

484
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
Not so great weather and so on but

485
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:33,503
No I knew we haven't had an electric bill when I at least 10 months so it's it's a wonderful time

486
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
Sounds awesome

487
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
All right

488
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
Well let's see

489
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,159
I wanted to take us into a little bit more of

490
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
Part of the Industrial

491
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,767
It's not industrial that's not the word I'm looking for

492
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,815
The kind of corporate Enterprise

493
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
Best thing because

494
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,399
This is a topic that I've been thinking about because

495
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:55,519
As we kind of gear into the holiday season and into the Consumer Electronics Show

496
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,823
I've been thinking about how

497
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
Who is buying the Smart Home

498
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
Home and if they really should

499
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,711
Give in my feelings about

500
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
Hubs

501
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,807
My Nest recently

502
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343
I've been kind of like down

503
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,231
Average consumers probably should not be buying a lot of things

504
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
They're kind of not worth it

505
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
I mean

506
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,375
You didn't you know how I've been kind of

507
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,679
I love I love this stuff

508
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
For most people it's

509
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,055
They're not going to get a lot of pleasure and they're probably going to be like

510
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,871
I was just going to say the bang for buck

511
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
Or value

512
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,943
Aspect of it is still

513
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,735
Not quite right I think for

514
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
Massive mainstream adopt

515
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551
It's getting better but

516
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
It's not there yet

517
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
So I've been thinking

518
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
In the last couple of months like

519
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,999
If it's not the consumer who is going to buy this where is the market

520
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,047
Where's the money where's the money

521
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
I figured it out

522
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
Okay

523
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
Kiss why not

524
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
Why not make grandiose

525
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,471
Interrupting

526
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
This is actually what I do while I'm so

527
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,311
I think about

528
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
I dream about it

529
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,127
Insurance companies

530
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,967
And comedies like ATT so insurance and security

531
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
These are the people

532
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,575
And I Enterprises that are going to be buying the smart

533
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
For you

534
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,647
And I actually got some great data on

535
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:19,744
I'd love to kind of share with people just to bolster so you don't think I'm totally crazy

536
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:24,352
So here at this is from Accenture they're putting that they put this report out this week

537
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
And I actually got date on

538
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
Is so most insurance company

539
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,240
I have already started with some pilot project

540
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
So

541
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,800
American family has

542
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
Is a pilot project with

543
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
Ring

544
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:40,224
Connected doorbell company and they also have one where they subsidize a nest protect

545
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Smoke detector

546
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:47,392
So nearly 4 and 10 ensures of piloted or launch the connected home or building offering

547
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
So far this year

548
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
Which is pretty freaking

549
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
Has more than tripled from

550
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
And

551
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,096
Last year only a minority had any iot

552
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,376
Plants related to Iowa

553
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
Or any iot

554
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
Plants related to the home

555
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
So

556
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
That's what

557
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:07,360
And then nearly half of insurers believe that connected devices will be a driver of Revenue growth in

558
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
In the next 3 years

559
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,200
So that's kind of a lot to think about but I'd love to unpack that

560
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Because

561
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
I think this could be

562
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,296
Really scary

563
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,648
For consumers if you look at it like if we don't have like regulations or I could wait at 10

564
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,672
Think about this

565
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:25,024
But I also think it could be really awesome because it's a really good way to get this kind of

566
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Stuff in people's homes

567
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,352
And probably a good way to get

568
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,912
The good stuff like the tested stuff in

569
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
So

570
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
On the positive side

571
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,568
The program that American family is doing with the nest protect is

572
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,384
All they want to do is I want to see

573
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Hey

574
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,456
Are the batteries in your smoke.

575
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,992
Because if they are

576
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,040
You're way more likely to be notified if

577
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
There's a fire in your house and

578
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,368
Rachel true

579
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
That's awesome

580
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,160
Like everybody can agree

581
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,952
That right and that's how a lot of these are

582
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,768
With the connected doorbell camera

583
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,096
It's a little bit different but they're looking for

584
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:04,192
Burglaries cuz he seems have actually been shown to help prevent burglaries because you can

585
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
Pretend like you're home

586
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,776
Even if they realize you're not home

587
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
Do you actually get

588
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
Footage from

589
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,128
Who's robbing your house

590
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
Which Canadian

591
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,432
Catching the thief chair

592
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Yay

593
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,272
Bad example in the dryer when you get these are both

594
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,344
But I called bigger bang for buck things people understand

595
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
The value that way

596
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,696
As opposed to seeing a bunch of products on a Shelf

597
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,232
Worden cap somewhere

598
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,024
Well this is cool though

599
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
What do I really get from it

600
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,888
You know any insurer in this cases are subsidizing

601
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424
Sometimes fully sometimes

602
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,264
So a lot of people are like

603
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Yay

604
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,592
Other insurers are like USAA testing

605
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,616
OBD port

606
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,152
Isis like automatic

607
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
And so

608
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,968
Let's talk about like

609
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
How do you feel about

610
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
Where does this become

611
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Scary for you

612
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
Well you know what

613
00:23:53,856 --> 00:24:00,000
Me personally I'm on more the do-it-yourself let me figure it out let me figure out what I want and what I want to do with it kind of person so

614
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
So

615
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,120
There's that side to it but as I look at the at the market as a whole

616
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
Your mainstream

617
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Sumer

618
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,008
I'm not scared of anything about it I think it's a good way to

619
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,824
Expand and broaden people's awareness these products

620
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,384
Search the ones that will add the most value to them

621
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,432
As opposed to again like I said

622
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
Here's a catalog of things

623
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,016
I'll pick some in and make your home smart

624
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
Why

625
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,320
What am I doing this for you know

626
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,648
There's a tangible benefit to doing that unless you can figure it out yourself

627
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,304
So I don't have any major issues with it from of privacy standpoint again I'm okay with

628
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
My insurance company knows if I have

629
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
Batteries in my

630
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
Smoke detector

631
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,704
Especially if they're going to eat me and maybe give me a discount on my

632
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
Insurance because of it

633
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,824
Help me in and helps them it's that it's safer for everybody around so

634
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,872
I don't really have any issues there either

635
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,200
I'm trying to think of it I have any privacy concerns with these

636
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,272
What about if your insurance firm starts penalizing

637
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Don't happen

638
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
Well yeah that's

639
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,160
Obviously that's the other side of the coin

640
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,488
I mean when I guess you could argue that by not by offering the

641
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Discount

642
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,840
Yeah it says they are right there penalizing people switch

643
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
The thing is

644
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:14,240
Obviously not everybody can afford nor made me not want these things and they're not mandatory for safety

645
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,544
Smoke detectors in SIDS they are but

646
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,384
It has to be a specific kind of smart smoke detector not necessarily

647
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
Sorry we have a problem if they did actually

648
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
Penalize me

649
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,016
For not having yeah I know I'm just thinking about the

650
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
Discus

651
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,832
Like the other issue is

652
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,648
Once you start adding connectivity into homes

653
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,952
You're going to start changing the risk profile

654
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
Across-the-board

655
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:39,072
Write like the risk will go down significantly

656
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,864
In a home that has

657
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,680
Connected smoke detectors because

658
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
That's my assumption

659
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984
Or like a

660
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
A moisture sensor

661
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
For example

662
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,616
That's the thinking I will say that I've had several leaks in my home

663
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,664
And none of them have actually occurred

664
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,480
Place where there is a moisture sensor there

665
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,880
Qdoba in the places where you know

666
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,696
Your refrigerator clothes on your hot water heater overflows

667
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,488
Switch I understand does happen

668
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
Puppy crate

669
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:15,936
So there's kind of like how much will that change service profile does that drive down the cost of insurance everywhere

670
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,008
How does those costs get spread around the

671
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
Industry

672
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:23,104
How are those savings get spread around the industry

673
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,408
Everyone's premiums go down I don't know

674
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,968
And I also think about Lake

675
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,760
When we start having

676
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,600
Can conversations about risk and privacy

677
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,416
Are regulatory bodies events

678
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
Ready to start

679
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Having this

680
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,512
Conversations cuz right now I'm not sure if they are

681
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:46,912
I would say it's premature to have this conversation so I don't think so bad if there's so many other more pressing issues to be

682
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
Dealing with

683
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
Areas to regulate

684
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,032
What makes sense to regulate areas to not regulate

685
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,568
So I agree with you on that one

686
00:26:54,592 --> 00:27:00,224
And then finally let's see how I should also mention State Farm is launching a program where they are

687
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
Giving out

688
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
Canaries

689
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:06,624
So Canary is an all-in-one security device they're giving it out to First Responders

690
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
And

691
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
I thought that was pretty cool

692
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,744
I was also thinking though

693
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,608
Canary has gotten in the news a couple times because people break in and they get camera footage of it

694
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
Youku

695
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,656
Satan call the police

696
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
Police are not

697
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
Always

698
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
Excited to be like

699
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,080
Oh here's the footage of this person breaking in

700
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,408
Especially if maybe in major cities were there like

701
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,736
But you know what we got like eight murders we've got to solve

702
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:39,136
And this is not becomes noise at a certain point I'm not trying to say something is more important than the other thing

703
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,928
Pet from Power Station Sandpoint for

704
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,232
Does resources it becomes noise

705
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,256
So I think

706
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
There's kind of an interesting

707
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,816
Sunset Lake

708
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,632
Hey now that we have these kind of

709
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,192
Resources available to us

710
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
How will that change things

711
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
Lion Force

712
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,104
I don't know big questions what's good question

713
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,128
If you have answers

714
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
You guys should tell

715
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Because

716
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,224
I don't know I'm just

717
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,528
It's okay to be Minority Report Sunday don't worry

718
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,344
No no no no that's the worst

719
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,136
Let us all not turn into a

720
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
That would be

721
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
Or anything starring

722
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,120
She went there

723
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,984
Okay alright alright Maverick I'll let you go on that one

724
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,080
Okay so stay tuned because we have kind of a new feature

725
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,640
That I'm not sure we're going to keep it up but you know

726
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,688
I had my husband on

727
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,224
To review the haiku

728
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,832
I don't even know what to call this device it's so new but kind of cool it's the connected

729
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
Speaker magnet

730
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
Grocery list

731
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,440
Making thing

732
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,512
You'll just have to listen to discover what it does

733
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:54,400
It's basically you talk into it and it collects your grocery list it's connected you can scan stuff into it it's

734
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
It's pretty cool

735
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,728
Because I don't grocery shop I had him review it

736
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
Any idea is that

737
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
There's a lot of things

738
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,312
Kevin and I

739
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,848
Don't need or use

740
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,896
Sparetime sprinklers are one of them

741
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Probably

742
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,992
Aging-in-place kind of devices are probably another thing

743
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,760
And

744
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:15,136
I'm kind of thinking we should probably talk to people who actually purchased these devices in her living with him

745
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,208
Kind of start conducting some reviews because

746
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:22,048
Nobody knows how connected devices going to do until you actually use it

747
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:28,448
So with that in mind stay tuned and you can learn more about the haiku

748
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:34,848
Hey everyone

749
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,152
We're back with the Internet of Things podcast

750
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,248
Instead of a guest this week we're going to do something a little bit new little bit different

751
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
And maybe something that if

752
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
If you guys like it will do in the future

753
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
So

754
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,136
I had a chance

755
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:50,208
To review a gadget called the Haiku but since

756
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,232
And it is a

757
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,792
It's a magnet we've had the CEO of the

758
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,072
Device on

759
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
The podcast before

760
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,424
It is a magnet that you attach to your fridge

761
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,448
And

762
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,752
You talk into it and you can

763
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
Get your grocery list

764
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,104
Do you tell your grocery list and if you're in the right area

765
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,664
You actually can send this grocery list to Walmart

766
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,224
Or to Peapod and

767
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
Neither

768
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,576
Delivery Peapod will deliver your groceries or Walmart

769
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
Well actually

770
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,416
Some of your groceries and you pick them up at curbside delivery

771
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,048
Since I don't grocery shop for my family I didn't really I make a very terrible reviewer for this

772
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,632
So I asked my husband who does do the grocery shopping for our family to review

773
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
So

774
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
Andrew hi Andrew

775
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
It's yellow

776
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
Yes

777
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,800
And what I'd like to say is if this

778
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,080
Is something you guys like

779
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,128
There a lot of gadgets that

780
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,224
I don't actually get a chance to review because I don't have like the facilities of perfect

781
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,248
Example is

782
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
Lawn sprinklers

783
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Because I

784
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
Actually is there Escape

785
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
I don't need to water it

786
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,928
Are you guys really want to know about connected lawn sprinklers

787
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
So

788
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,000
Email me if you have

789
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:02,400
You know a rachio or droplet or I guess the Green Wave system and maybe we'll start doing more

790
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,192
Kind of user reviews because

791
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
Really the best way to

792
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:09,056
Know if you want one of these it's to live with it for a long time and porch

793
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,384
So info at iot podcast

794
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
Animals

795
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
This is something we want to

796
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
And now

797
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
Andrew

798
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,528
You have the haiku

799
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,320
Which is a 49

800
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
$99 device

801
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,648
What was your take on this

802
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,976
Yeah so you know you described it as a magnet it's really like

803
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,792
Got a tiny voice recognizer and

804
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:33,376
Barcode Scanner and one and it sticks to the side of your fridge

805
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,656
From a magnet

806
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,960
And I'll say that I came from this

807
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
I'm one of those people

808
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
I do the grocery shopping

809
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
For the family

810
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,872
And I usually write my list on in a

811
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:50,272
Paper and bring it to the store I'm not one of those people that keeps a list in the iPhone so I knew this was going to be a big

812
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,064
Adjustment going in

813
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:56,160
In my experience might be a little bit different from someone who always keeps our list

814
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,696
On your iPhone so

815
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:01,536
First of all the scanning feature of it where you can scan barcode is kind of a dick

816
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
To set it up

817
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
It took maybe a minute to set up

818
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
Basically just

819
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:09,984
Downloaded the app on the iPhone went through some setup instructions and was all set up

820
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,056
Should I was super simple in any kind of you start

821
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,336
Using the scanner on

822
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,920
NASA shoots out kind of a red typical kind of barcode scanner

823
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:21,504
And it's kind of fun right cuz you pick up products in

824
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,624
And you scan it and it's a little bit of Dick thing I know I'm kind of weird that way

825
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,512
But I really like that the scanning feature and then what it does when you scan it basically sends the product

826
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Name

827
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,352
To your iPhone app to a list there so that was pretty neat

828
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,144
And I should know that Andrew is

829
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
Is a little weird

830
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
Which is why

831
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,496
But also this is something that

832
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,800
Work not just for the iPhone but this also works for

833
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,896
Yes yes it does work with Android as well

834
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:55,552
The basic idea here is you are trying to capture your grocery list right and in my case it was to bring it to the garage

835
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,088
Grocery store not to use

836
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
Peapod

837
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,904
Or at WalMart delivery

838
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:04,000
There two ways to get something onto list when is the scan the barcode

839
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
Any other is

840
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
Talking to it

841
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,864
And so from a skin perspective I'd say

842
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,424
80% of the things I scanned

843
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,216
Or in the database

844
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,264
The majority of ones weren't

845
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,872
That weren't restore brands from the dominant grocer here in Texas

846
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
HEB

847
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,456
So that was a little frustrating that

848
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,760
A lot of those store brands weren't in there

849
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,320
When you scan a barcode it gives you

850
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,648
Sound feedback saying whether or not it found the product or not

851
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:38,304
Sometimes National products a couple of them I couldn't get to work at all and sometimes just scanning the

852
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
Barcode

853
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,864
Had to try it a few times two

854
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
To get it just right but

855
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,936
Over always pretty happy with

856
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
With the scanning feature

857
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,776
The voice recognition

858
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,336
It left a little bit to be desired

859
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:55,712
And the issue here is not whether or not a recognized you it's whether it recognizes you correct

860
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,504
So I'd say

861
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,600
Again maybe 80% of the time I'd say something into it like

862
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,624
Pomegranate

863
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,440
Macaroni and cheese and it would get a perf

864
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:11,584
I do it add it to the list and it adds it to the section of the list you know dairy or produce

865
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
It made sense

866
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:16,960
Other times I would say something in it and recognize something else

867
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,752
And put it on the list in this

868
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,312
Came a little bit of a challenge

869
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:27,456
Because I had to double-check I almost had to open up the iPhone app after I would say something into

870
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,760
The Haiku just to make sure I got the right thing

871
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,856
Is otherwise I'll be scratching my head at the end of the week when I'm looking at my listing it

872
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:40,000
You know says to buy marshmallows why did I put marshmallows on the listing and really I meant something else

873
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,304
So from a convenience factor

874
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,352
Hey this is just on side of the fridge

875
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,400
And I can talk into it

876
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:52,544
And it'll added to my list that's great but at least in a couple weeks I tried it I wasn't a hundred percent comfortable that way

877
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,592
Capturing the right information

878
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,896
Okay so the question is

879
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,944
Would you buy this

880
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
450 bucks

881
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
Is it worth it

882
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
I would not

883
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,088
Because I'm not the type of person who

884
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,904
Keeps a list on my iPhone I think if I

885
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,488
Kept the grocery list on my phone my Android or iPhone

886
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,280
Then I think this would be worth

887
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,304
Working with

888
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,680
But for me it was kind of frustrating in the store having to unlock my phone several times to see

889
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,472
To see what was on the list

890
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,520
One cool thing I did like

891
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,568
Compared to the old paper

892
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
List

893
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,896
Is it you can swipe off items after

894
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
Do you get them

895
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:36,320
And so that way you don't have those two things on your list that you overlooked you get home and your wife is upset with you. That's

896
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:40,928
Never happened to me I like that that feature as well

897
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
Okay

898
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
And

899
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,000
Another thing if you

900
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
What do the pickup

901
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,328
Would that change like

902
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
They're rolling his pickup out

903
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
Lacrosse

904
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,656
Hopefully

905
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
The country

906
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:55,008
So we have a Walmart actually fire daughter

907
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,288
School so

908
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,568
Would that change

909
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Equation

910
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,176
Give me what I buy groceries at Walmart or what I get to hike

911
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,712
Would you get the haiku

912
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:12,416
Note to the Walmart but so yeah I think that changes a lot right

913
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:17,792
For a couple reasons one you have to enter your order electronically anyway so this is a lot

914
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,864
Easier way to enter an electronic order

915
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,680
Then typing it in a searching for each product

916
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:29,312
Too I think the accuracy would be a lot better the product you're getting I mean when you

917
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,872
I scan a bottle of Heinz Ketchup

918
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,664
It doesn't just say ketchup

919
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,064
Anna haikyuu it says you know 18 hour times you know it's got the barcode so you're going to get that product

920
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,856
I mean it's delivered so

921
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,952
I think that makes it a lot more interesting you'd still want to review the list

922
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,232
Before you submit it

923
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,536
Or your delivery or pickup

924
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
Because

925
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,376
Especially if you use the voice prompts what you will

926
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,728
Then you're going to be an especially for produce and things without a barcode

927
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:02,336
You just want to make sure that it got the right thing so you don't get strange things in your order

928
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:06,176
While missing other important things I know you would love to get it

929
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Extra bag of March

930
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
Just don't lie

931
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,272
I do so that's actually something I've

932
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,392
Telesto marshmallows what is good idea Haiku thank you

933
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:20,768
Like I said I got a little carried away with it let me scan notice it was all for testing purposes though

934
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
Offer testing

935
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,328
Excellent

936
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
Awesome well thank you so much

937
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888
Andrew

938
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
I appreciate you

939
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704
Sitting there

940
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,496
And doing other testing and

941
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,520
All the grocery shopping

942
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,312
I think that is spit is really awesome of you

943
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
So

944
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
Haiku

945
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,408
If you like making grocery list

946
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,944
In your iPhone

947
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
Or Android

948
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,528
This is good at the other feature I should actually

949
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,600
If we both actually stopped at the grocery store and regular basis

950
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,160
You can actually share your list across phones

951
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,976
Which makes this kind of a nice to be sure because

952
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:56,864
Somebody who's out can actually say oh hey we're out of milk according to the Haiku I'll just stop in and get it

953
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,448
Which if you're the kind of people who actually

954
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,032
Shirtless this could also be a good cutting gadget for y'all

955
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,592
We don't do that because I just

956
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
Leave the house because I work

957
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
Work from home

958
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,200
So

959
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
Like it's true guys

960
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
It is

961
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,808
All right

962
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,344
Well thank you so much

963
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
For doing the gadget review

964
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,416
Remember you guys at this

965
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,952
This is something you like let me know

966
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:27,840
And also you can start volunteering for things I am actively searching for people who have Kinect

967
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
Kid sprinklers

968
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,376
So

969
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:33,728
You do have to purchase it with your own money and have lived with it and I will that these things

970
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,568
