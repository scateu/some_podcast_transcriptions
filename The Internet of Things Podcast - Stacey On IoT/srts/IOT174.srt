00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,776
Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,312
Stacey Higginbotham

3
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,848
Your co-host Kevin tofel

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
And we have

5
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:19,456
A stellar show for you today I am calling in from

6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,016
My hotel room at Google Cloud next

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,576
Which we will talk about briefly and then we'll be

8
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,696
And we will also cover some exciting things like a brand-new SmartThings tracker

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,000
Didn't adding Google Assistant support

10
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,328
Google Assistant also taking video calls for the

11
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,376
Yet-to-be-released video screen

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,144
Functionality

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,424
There's I do

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,960
Security flaw in the aisle

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,264
Kevin's going to talk a little bit about

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,312
Is cloud headache you guys are going to want to

17
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,592
To stay for this

18
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
And

19
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,152
We are bringing back our

20
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,432
Is this the worst

21
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,224
Connected idea of the week

22
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,504
Because

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,528
Well we found something new

24
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,296
Was pretty bad

25
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,832
You can let us know what you think

26
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:01,184
Who's there and our guest this week is Elana Fishman

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,744
The CEO of wise

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,352
Labs and you guys are probably familiar with this because we've talked about the wise cam

29
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:12,192
She's going to explain how the heck they get those so

30
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
So

31
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,008
Before we get into all of this

32
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,288
Let's hear a word from

33
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,312
Our sponsor

34
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
A pharaoh

35
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
Looking for an iot platform find out why Kenmore and D-Link picked a pharaoh Pharaoh customers have Xperia

36
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:31,392
As much as an 80% reduction in time-to-market 99% pure support calls antenna

37
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:37,792
Text higher activation rates plus they can reuse 90% of their work from one project to the next to learn more

38
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,632
Visita Ferro. IO that's a fer

39
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
IO

40
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
Hook head

41
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
Heaven

42
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,776
So I am at

43
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,056
Google this week

44
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,104
Probably just get to your Google

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
Disclosure out-of-the-way

46
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,432
I'm so glad you mentioned it because I forgot

47
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
I am

48
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,576
Freelancing for Google reading some blog posts for them is strictly in their

49
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,136
Romeria has nothing to do with

50
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
Ayote

51
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,976
Tuyet also new influencer anything there

52
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:11,072
And the other thing I want to say is I'm so excited that your Google Cloud next because

53
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:15,936
Last year when I had it I was working for Google full-time and I had such a blast working at event

54
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:22,080
I think it's a cool if I could just eat all cloud and let me know if your developer you are really into it I'm sure but it's still some neat stuff coming out

55
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,128
Lots of really good custom

56
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:29,248
Choosing Google Cloud

57
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
3

58
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,600
Consider worth mentioning for The Internet of Things

59
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,440
For you actually by the way you guys

60
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,512
Chromebooks

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Dot-com

62
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
So

63
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,520
If you have time for another hobby after IRT come visit

64
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
Do you know I think they're easier

65
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,616
Let's talk about Google's news

66
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
This week they announced

67
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Kubernetes on

68
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,992
Prim and for all

69
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,808
This is an orchestration layer

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
It's actually

71
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,160
Turning out to be the orchestration therefore

72
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,720
Iot to tie the Cloud 2

73
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,280
What everyone calls the edge and we can defer

74
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
A little bit

75
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,608
The Edge actually is the point is

76
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
If you're going to build something

77
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,960
As a developer both places

78
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Today because I

79
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:29,408
Internet places you mean in the cloud as well as maybe on-premises at your place of business

80
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:34,784
Premises at your place of business and eventually you want to write things that run in the cloud and on like

81
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Cars

82
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:40,160
And other computers that are running around like Gateway devices on premise

83
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
So it's not just like

84
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Super

85
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
Server computer

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
So Microsoft announced something called cubelets

87
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
They're actually virtual Cuba

88
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,888
That allows

89
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
2

90
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,496
Have his orchestration there been both places unless you manage everything

91
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Incoherent

92
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
It's a big thing

93
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,872
I'm not going to get too technical with you guys because you're probably like

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
Stop

95
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:06,784
I don't know what it is anyway they have them at Thanksgiving we have giblets in

96
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
Right I saw your joke

97
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,464
I'm sorry

98
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Okay

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
So

100
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
Google announce kubernetes

101
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,887
On premise which is a step closer to getting these things

102
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
Working everywhere

103
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
This is an important project

104
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Pay attention

105
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,519
They also announced age TP

106
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
To use

107
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,639
Gpus are there tensorflow processors are tensor processors which is their machine

108
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,711
Processors there specially designed ships just for

109
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Machine learning

110
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,551
These are not

111
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,415
Media camera things that run Linux

112
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,231
I'm in the also announced Cloud iot Edge

113
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,535
Which is pretty much the same thing Microsoft

114
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
How's their iot Edge software in this is

115
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Again just a way to

116
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
Annette

117
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Door

118
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,983
Device with limited computing power

119
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
Back to the cloud

120
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
So that's what

121
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,639
Now everybody has

122
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,967
Everybody I really just want Google Amazon

123
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,295
Microsoft Google has been a laggard in the iot space

124
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
So these announcements really loud

125
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
Catch up with things

126
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,999
One more qualifier here in case people have not heard of kubernetes is a container

127
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Solution

128
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:27,167
So you can not worry about the setting up virtual machines and servers and all that you literally just have a container without a plant

129
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
Uninstall Dimmitt on demand

130
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,103
Kubernetes is open source button is doing is they have their gke kubernetes engine

131
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
The tie into all of their iot stuff

132
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
End

133
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
Letter

134
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
So I'm not going to

135
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:46,111
Picture story

136
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
Microsoft and Amazon

137
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,255
Go Google and actually last bit we talked

138
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
Probably six months ago on this podcast is Google's IRT strategy and I think we've got a better answer that now

139
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
You just talked about

140
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,775
Next it's becoming a little more cohesive it's an easier story to tell

141
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Yes

142
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
Yay

143
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Okay

144
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
No moving on to

145
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,175
Fun and exciting thing

146
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
Kevin had a scoop this week

147
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
And

148
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
Yeah I had to scoop this week

149
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
Oh you want to really talk about it sure

150
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:27,071
I actually for my Chromebook stuff I actually scour the FCC database here in the US because any devices

151
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:33,471
That emit wireless radio signals are tested by the SEC before they can go on sale and that's how I found about new Chromebooks another device

152
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
And I found a new device

153
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,103
Not only that I think is the

154
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
First

155
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,663
In the US anyway the first

156
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,247
T consumer device that will use either

157
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,063
Cat M1 or NB iot Networks

158
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
Through either Verizon or

159
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
AT&T

160
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:57,023
The device is the Samsung SmartThings tracker it has not been announced during the US so that's where the

161
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,327
Scoop part comes in however

162
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
They launched

163
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
A

164
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,519
Product that looks exactly the same as the same functionality in Korea back in October and they called that the Samsung

165
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
Connect tag

166
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,103
And basically what this device is it

167
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:17,503
I like a Bluetooth tracker that you might put on your car keys or a backpack or whatever is my pay whatever possession

168
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,831
Have we might carry it around with you even I'll tell you why in a second it's got

169
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
Bluetooth GPS

170
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
But then it connects

171
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
Next to the iot networks imagine

172
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
And what that will do is

173
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,327
It will allow you to remotely find these

174
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Devices

175
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:38,495
Are your possessions with the devices attached you can't do that with say a Tracker or a tile unless you get crowdsource

176
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,287
Information from other users and such

177
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,847
This will be just like a Find My Phone type

178
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:49,247
The function so I don't know the price yet don't know what the service cost will be a couple bucks a month for sure it also has a button

179
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,647
On it so that you can press the button and send your location to anyone in your contacts and

180
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,463
Smartphone component that many people may not realize

181
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
You could use this

182
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,047
Is a way to geofence your home

183
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:08,447
Close your home your drive close to your home you could tie into SmartThings Hub because it is a SmartThings device have your garage door opener

184
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
Turn lights go on soap

185
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:15,103
Using your phone for the geofencing you could use the Samsung connect tracker based on what I believe is coming

186
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,895
Got it yes and

187
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
I actually wouldn't have my SmartThings

188
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,319
The presence detector was one of my favorite items is part of like the little bundle because I put one in my

189
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
Husband's car and I used to have him

190
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,671
When she was getting closer

191
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,231
DiGiorno you put that in

192
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,303
Okay and I wasn't stalking him

193
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
I just want

194
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,727
I just wanted when he got close enough to get to my house I want to be able to add a light flash

195
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
Run downstairs

196
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
Who is my

197
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:50,943
Yeah I never empty the dishwasher and when blood comes home I get yelled at so I like this I did okay

198
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
It's B get out of jail

199
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
I don't know how much

200
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
Will find out

201
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
All right

202
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Next

203
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
We're going to talk about

204
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,719
I don't know what to call this but I saw two stories this week

205
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:09,375
When was from Slate and it was talking about it was a guy who would install the ring video doorbell

206
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,679
And she loved it but he found himself

207
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
Freaking out because of the notify

208
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Patience

209
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,799
And there were two components to this one is

210
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,615
He didn't realize that he could fine-tune as notifications

211
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
II was

212
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
He still

213
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
After you done that

214
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,807
Still kind of freaked out knowing all this stuff any kind of developed an unhealthy relationship with her

215
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
Does ring video doorbell

216
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,135
Maybe less safe in Disney World

217
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
The other story

218
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
Was

219
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
And it talked about

220
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
It basically talked about

221
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
Trying to piggyback on

222
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,911
This President moved into a house with smart gadgets and had a lot of trouble

223
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
Cutting them up and installing them

224
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,775
And then they also had an issue with the nest because

225
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,335
They were trying to program The Nest Thermostat

226
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,431
I don't know how cold do you want to be what time do you want to change

227
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,831
That's a little ironic because the nest actually if you just reset it and live with it for a week it'll figure that out so but

228
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
2 things I thought were

229
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,415
We're talking about from the stories one

230
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
Smart home devices are still really difficult

231
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,559
There's a lot of questions and information with the setup process

232
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
People kind of take for granted

233
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:18,751
First aid for granite I don't think they should because it is hard when you put these things into try to figure out

234
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,847
I know how many zones does my sprinkler have what type of dirt do I have

235
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
No

236
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:29,247
I mean part as I read that article this late one in particular I thought he was over react

237
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,831
However I get it and I still think he was to a point but less

238
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:38,463
So now as I think about your average consumer who just says over

239
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,863
The features that are touted are great you can see who's coming up your walkway before you can get there you can have it to a voice conversation

240
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,215
There is benefit there but what comes with that isn't talked about

241
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
And

242
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,543
So I sort of get his point that you know he's like this

243
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Too much information

244
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Information overload

245
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,639
I feel like the house is wearing Google Glass he said

246
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
I sorta

247
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Get that now

248
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,015
It comes back to planning what you want you can just go out and buy a product

249
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
Without planning

250
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
Because you need to understand what it's going to do when it's

251
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
Going to do that you like

252
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,183
What's going to do it you don't like what kind of information is going to capture

253
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:14,559
And you need to fine-tune your settings I think a lot of his beefs could have been handled better in terms of

254
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
The notification center

255
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,399
So you're right though it is still complicated

256
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
It's a long way of saying

257
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
And there are

258
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
Like my husband

259
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
How to Fitbit and he took it off because it's dead into like certain the rosies he had he was like I don't like it it's not making me healthier

260
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
More focused on this thing

261
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:36,831
I understand that I think also as he gets older he's going to find his child has a baby

262
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:43,231
Gets older he's going to have an unintended side-effect of when I'm traveling I actually love check it out by video doorbell because

263
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
My daughter Whitney

264
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
See her everyday when she left

265
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,655
So that was just a nice thing that

266
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
And then also

267
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
When she leaves stuff at school

268
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
We can always check the video doorbell evidence

269
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847
Wearing a jacket when you came home

270
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
So

271
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
Yeah I think if your

272
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,247
Type of person who wants that

273
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,599
Connection to your property in your family and your pets in Saint Beast

274
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
Obviously there's a lot of great devices that can do that

275
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:18,047
If you're the type of person who says I get too many notifications on my phone today and I don't even have Smart Home devices if you suffer from it

276
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Information overload

277
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
You may want to think twice about

278
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,911
Really invested in some of these products

279
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Yes

280
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
Speaking of doorbells

281
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,847
Which is best for you guys when is Kevin swapped out his doorbell

282
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
You swapped out your ring

283
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,687
I did

284
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,759
I did I have been having some issues with the ring doorbell and turn

285
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:44,159
Is connectivity and I couldn't even do a hard reset for some reason the kids would never get me through to the setup process to

286
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
Find my wireless network

287
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
And

288
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
I suspected

289
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Probably

290
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,095
Firmware or Hardware issue at this point in the reason I say that is

291
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
Because I recently purchased a nest by Yale lock

292
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:59,263
Lock so I decided to let's go with a nest doorbell to replace the ring

293
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,663
Bring a buddy who's installed and it is video doorbells if you have a regular old chime you know you have like little jumper cables

294
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
To install in the chime itself

295
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:12,063
And I did that with the ring and everything was working for a while then it stopped working

296
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
Hello comes with the same type of

297
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
Connections and let you know what

298
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,927
I bet you

299
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
It's pretty much the same from an electric

300
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,559
Circuit standpoint

301
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,655
Pulling out the doorbell itself the ring doorbell putting in the nest hello

302
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,495
I went through the setup process and it does work so I didn't have to go into the time so

303
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,799
Text a good thing people want to swap doorbells

304
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
Probably don't have to get into your old chime again

305
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
Yeah

306
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
The other thing is

307
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,295
It went right like I said through the setup process flawlessly ATS working 100% like no issues whatsoever so

308
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
Again I think I probably have

309
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Battering units

310
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
Probably should have

311
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
Complain about it

312
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,719
Send it back but

313
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
I don't know either

314
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,279
Starting to go all nest in that regard

315
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
Hey

316
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,607
So final bit of doorbell

317
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
This is

318
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,447
Arlo is going to add a doorbell to it

319
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
Lineup of products

320
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,055
The timing on that is certain but

321
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
It's not a video.

322
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
Fedora Wireless

323
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
You just push it and it notifies you

324
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
Your phone

325
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,527
Talk to the person

326
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Are you on your

327
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,487
Ankle tie it into the existing Arlo video products

328
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,071
That's why it can be battery powered off a two-way batteries for

329
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
Two double a batteries for

330
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:36,031
Yeah I remember we had a call or question about video doorbells that were battery-powered and

331
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
The issue is the video component

332
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,199
And that's what's gone from this particular device in that way they can run on those you said to batteries

333
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:48,063
Spray year you can't do that with video we just can't and that's why they're typically wired so

334
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,391
I see why this might appeal to a

335
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Swap

336
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
People but

337
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,743
Not a very large swath not homeowners

338
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
I mean

339
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
A lot of people

340
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Videos

341
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,631
So I don't know but there's like the guide

342
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
So

343
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Okay

344
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,007
Speaking of getting uncomfortable

345
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,079
Let's talk about the latest security flaw

346
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:18,015
Yeah yeah and the Bluetooth Sig is already spoken up about it most of the coverage that I read about

347
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
Thought this was really about

348
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,855
Bluetooth devices such as your phones and things

349
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:28,255
I think there's actually IRT component because there are blue toothpaste iot devices so that's the only reason I bring this

350
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
Because it has to do with the

351
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:35,423
Bluetooth standard simple secure pairing process and Bluetooth LE secure connections pairing process

352
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,495
Entirety devices can use those

353
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
It basically

354
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,335
Has to do with the key pairs in the security

355
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,127
Part of the pairing process

356
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
And the only way if

357
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
This was an iot device repair

358
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
The only way somebody could

359
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,295
Possibly intercept and inject malicious code

360
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
They have to be in range

361
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,391
Your devices as you are Perry

362
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:01,535
So you know any time you're going to pair Bluetooth devices just make sure Nobody's around for 350 I guess at the other the best I can say

363
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
Try to avoid that guy walking

364
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
It's always

365
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,447
And see if you had a video doorbell you know where it was but that's a whole nother issue

366
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,615
Basically Microsoft said their devices are not affected Google hasn't said any about Android based devices not Center

367
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:22,015
Because there are a few I have two devices that are android-based but Apple broadcom Intel have all deployed fixes for the bugs

368
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,295
And Qualcomm has as well

369
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:28,927
I don't have a list of devices on the IRT side that have been affected because nobody has put that together but I just thought I'd throw it out there

370
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
All right

371
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
About

372
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,935
One didn't his attitude

373
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:46,335
Google Assistant support

374
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
Smart Home Products

375
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
So

376
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,759
Sign up with Vivint are giving every new customer

377
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,551
Two Google home mini devices now

378
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,599
And also they are adding support

379
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
For The Nest Thermostat

380
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,183
E and Google Wi-Fi

381
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
Yeah okay

382
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,559
Google Assistant can now start video calls

383
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
Duo

384
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Duo

385
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
Weather

386
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,727
I could really get it

387
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
6

388
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,031
Of my hundreds of contacts I think

389
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
Six or seven of them

390
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,591
Wow

391
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
Wow that's pretty good

392
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
You know cuz I'm used to help with

393
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,223
I did dog food when I'm sick Google but haven't used it since

394
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,063
This is phone Centric right now it's

395
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,391
You can then use your phone with Google Assistant simulator Android phone

396
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
USAA

397
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
When I can say it but hey G

398
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,255
No call so-and-so on Duo

399
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:41,119
And hopefully won't say on who I place the call

400
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Okay

401
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,007
Did you go I think we have expanded now yes I'm sorry

402
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
Maybe that's why people top music hits

403
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,103
What it is

404
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,175
Regardless so for video calling you can use Duo yet

405
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,223
It's only for phones right now

406
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:02,367
I think of this could be a precursor to Google home devices with screens maybe that

407
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Smart

408
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
Display that we saw at CES for example

409
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
601 from Lenovo

410
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
Is take my money

411
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:16,959
But even like my Nvidia Shield has Google Assistant built-in and is obviously connected to a TV because it's an Android TV

412
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Set up box

413
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:24,383
So if there was a video camera that I could be adding to the Nvidia boom I can do it that way as well there's lots of possibilities

414
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,199
Don't get too excited yet cuz it's really just for phones at the MoMA

415
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
And it's doing

416
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
Something got to

417
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Moving right along

418
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,599
Let's talk about

419
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,879
Your cloud

420
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Xperia

421
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
I'm very curious

422
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,999
About acting

423
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
Voicemail

424
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:48,959
Which we already did once we originally started on a Raspberry Pi and we've had some issues because

425
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,543
Is the dog likes to yank on the power cord and when I happens there is no iron

426
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Voicemail

427
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,407
So I moved everything up to Google Cloud

428
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
It was

429
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
Pretty easy

430
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,807
And I didn't under the free tier but unfortunately one of the services it's using is not free

431
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
So we look

432
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
At AWS

433
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
And I spent

434
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
At least

435
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,975
Four times as much time

436
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
Getting it to run on AWS

437
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,839
The whole user experience was

438
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,887
So much more challenging to me

439
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:24,287
And you know I'm not a developer by trade I don't have any formal training this is me hacking way tinkering and figuring things out soon

440
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
Maybe it's me I will say that

441
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:31,967
But at least with Google I could actually write code in the cloud I want to hear through their Cloud9 editor but here I had to do it

442
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,295
Locally and put it all up and I had to even send it all up through

443
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
A terminal

444
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,599
Command line interface

445
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,951
Any before can use that I had to install the command line interface to a Linux

446
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,511
Turn it all on my Chrome but it was just

447
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
So many steps

448
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,631
And in the end even though I got it working it failed after a day

449
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:54,239
Now that could be the way I implemented I will say that I'm not cutting AWS on this one

450
00:19:54,495 --> 00:20:00,639
And the weird thing is like with Google you sign out of your terminal at your service still runs here through the command line terminal when I killed

451
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
My connection

452
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
The service just stop so I need

453
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,991
To figure out how to make a keep running and all that but

454
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
I'm so fed up with it

455
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,575
That it's like I almost don't want to figure it out

456
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,159
Cloud headache doesn't describe a time I spent so many hours and

457
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Just got

458
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
So

459
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
Frustrated

460
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,023
So if you have help for Kevin

461
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
I'm sure he would welcome to us

462
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
Send Advil

463
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
This is just

464
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:31,615
I thought it was an experience guy's perspective

465
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
The stuff

466
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,199
You know you may be an expert in AWS

467
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,735
I'm trying to convert over to Google

468
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
Everything speaks to how

469
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,295
Easier it is to

470
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:44,159
From one to the other so we're not taking a lot

471
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,207
People especially since our audience likes to

472
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Do this word

473
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
Alright hey

474
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
You want to talk about

475
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
Worst iot

476
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
The idea of the week

477
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,655
I almost don't have to reading what it was

478
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:01,567
But yes we should because everyone should share in our misery unless there's a few people who want Bluetooth LE

479
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,359
Jeans from Tommy Hilfiger

480
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
Yes

481
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,663
This week

482
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Today

483
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,967
Wednesday Tommy

484
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
I don't even know

485
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
Pink slacks

486
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,855
They actually announced the

487
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,879
Tommy jeans

488
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
Explorer

489
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,952
Which are jeans with a Bluetooth

490
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
Low-energy chip in them

491
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,280
And they are

492
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
I don't know how to explain

493
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
You activated

494
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
And the app

495
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Basically

496
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
Talk to your jeans in your phone

497
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,032
You don't have to wear your pear

498
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,640
You get points based on how often

499
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,736
One-of-a-kind rewards and experiences this basically

500
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,576
Buy some jeans with a chip in it so we can

501
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:51,488
That's exactly what it is because at the tail end of this they try and sell it

502
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,048
Take me to tell you what is marketing plan

503
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,936
If they say the integrated technology in the product allows for brand engagement and interaction Beyond tradition

504
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,776
Because I got to finish this one this one made me laugh

505
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:10,176
True Rewards experiences an interactive hotspots located across the country so you got to go certain places

506
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,088
The app brings users together creating a community of high engaged micro brand ambassador

507
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
Yeah so this is

508
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,488
Rebecca Minkoff who makes

509
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
Accessories

510
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,816
She actually herbrand actually did one of these

511
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,168
And I thought it was stupid when you suck these on purses although there was I think

512
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
Tracking

513
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
Yeah this

514
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,288
This is not what you

515
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,872
However if you are out there to do

516
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
You want this

517
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
Please share with us

518
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
Why

519
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,528
Interconnected hoodies as well

520
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Those cost a hundred bucks

521
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
Inogen cost

522
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
120

523
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
So

524
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:56,000
You'd have to pay me a hundred twenty bucks and is his key

525
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,304
You have to create a VR apps like

526
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,888
Pokemon go where I can walk around New York City with my jeans and look

527
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
VR to see who else is wearing Tommy jeans

528
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
And

529
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
Tagging to get points

530
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,032
Cuz that would be fun but other than that now

531
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
Yeah they do have a Tommy

532
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,592
Sport duffel bag

533
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Still no

534
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
It doesn't mention in the duffle bag

535
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248
Bluetooth

536
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
Which I think is actually kind of a waste

537
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:25,952
Yeah maybe have it right there somebody steals your duffle bag gets 30 feet away your tummy app should tell you

538
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,720
Right

539
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
You should integrate with

540
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
Something else where

541
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Tatami tile

542
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
This is

543
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
In our opinion

544
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,424
A silly stupid idea

545
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,448
Like I buy a lot of

546
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
Connected things in

547
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
But if you do let us know

548
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,848
You can actually

549
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,640
Watch this which is

550
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Conical

551
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,808
Waterproof protection in there any smart clothing would have that I mean I've learned some more

552
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,624
Vests and socks and things and just throw up

553
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
There's usually up

554
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:04,096
Yeah but there's a maybe maybe Tommy didn't think about that part too well we don't know

555
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
Okay

556
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
Silly ideas

557
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Of the week

558
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,992
Let's now go to our voicemail for this week for the iot podcast listener hotline

744

569
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
Leave us a question

570
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
At the end of this month

571
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Draw winner

572
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Midnight

573
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
YouTube

574
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
Here this week

575
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,672
Actually listen to your podcast recent

576
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,208
Stumbled upon

577
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,000
My question is

578
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,768
Why doesn't

579
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
Every

580
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
Sparkle

581
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
Accessory manufacturer looks like

582
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
Or any other brain

583
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,680
Why don't y'all just work with Alexa

584
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
Why is there

585
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
Is it more than just

586
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,128
Hello Google vs Alexa

587
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
Like I said

588
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Extension

589
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
Why are there different

590
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
Protocols

591
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Lexi way

592
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
Why wouldn't everything

593
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
Can you work with Alexa right out the box

594
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,904
Or maybe just work with Google

595
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
Mark good good question

596
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,512
Yes excellent question

597
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,328
And we tend to take it for granted the people know about this but

598
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
That's a dumb thing on our behalf because

599
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,936
Why would you want to know this much about the intern

600
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
Show Kevin

601
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
Bricktown

602
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
The issues here

603
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,384
Yeah there's a couple of questions and this one is more opinion than anything and you can chime in if you disagree with

604
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,688
So why doesn't every smart home device makers

605
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,480
Work with matinee or

606
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
Google

607
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
Dothan salon

608
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
I do think there is

609
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,416
I will look at your device maker at market share who's got

610
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,232
More speakers out there who do you want to partner with

611
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,768
I don't think

612
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:13,376
I believe that most of the device makers want to work with everything as much as possible

613
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,168
Apple certainly limits that

614
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,216
Because device makers have to make

615
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,568
A homekit version of a device as well as I don't get version it would work with

616
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,872
Mad at me or Google home etcetera so

617
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,688
I think that's part of it I don't think there's anything nefarious about

618
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:30,784
Choosing one over the other if your device maker but that's just my take on the first part I

619
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,344
I don't know if you agree

620
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,904
You're right Madam is the most popular but it's not the only one

621
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm so later when we do our interview with the

622
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
That one first because

623
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
By golly

624
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,072
That's whatever

625
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,144
Get into the fair question

626
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
Which is what is

627
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,240
It sounds almost like what is Z-Wave why is he wave

628
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,568
That is a function of

629
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
Those are older Sanders

630
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872
They've been around

631
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,920
Everyone wants to be the standard in the

632
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
We haven't actually come

633
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,248
With one that's going to stick so far

634
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:05,088
And so you still need those and it's partially because

635
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,136
The smart digital assistants

636
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
For the most part

637
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,488
They don't have the radios needed

638
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,280
They're just actually a voice in Her

639
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,840
And it actually takes a lot

640
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,120
To get new device

641
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,192
So both Google and Amazon have

642
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
Established

643
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
Frameworks

644
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,056
Now for things like thermostats and lights that say

645
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
Hey

646
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,384
If you make a light bulb you just use that framework in

647
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,016
Everything's very easy but if you make something like an oven or kitchen faucet you actually have to develop that framework

648
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,064
With Google in Amazon

649
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
To start

650
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856
Mykonos things easy

651
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,160
That I should gets back to homekit

652
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,232
It is actually easier and requires less

653
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,632
Hardware on the Hub side because Apple chose not to use any of those other particles they only use what's

654
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
Readily available

655
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
Heating WiFi and Bluetooth

656
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,984
In which case

657
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
Apple iOS devices

658
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,104
Does radios by default phones tablets the Apple TV

659
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
Homepod

660
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,432
That's why they can be Apple's homekit hub

661
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,248
When you start introducing Z-Wave products

662
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,040
Zigbee products

663
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:13,440
Get away from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are good reasons to use those radio protocols they might be one of them had Mesh networking

664
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,000
Extend the range of your devices

665
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,560
You need a hub to manage that

666
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:23,680
Radio chatter because the Google home doesn't have that radio inside so it doesn't understand anything

667
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:29,824
Take me to go back to a hub and get that information now there is Amazon does have a hub it's the Echo Plus I believe

668
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,616
It is and it has zigbee

669
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
Seaway band

670
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,480
Not all zigbee devices actually work

671
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,760
So

672
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
And that gets into a d

673
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
You are right

674
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,416
Don't want this to be simple and easy

675
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
And you shouldn't have to learn all this

676
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
And

677
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
Great answer

678
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
But it is

679
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
Hey

680
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
I think we've done a pretty good job.

681
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,680

We're just going to go right into the big question

732
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
Which is

733
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,720
You guys are selling a really highly capable camera

734
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,256
For not a lot

735
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
Of money it feels like

736
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
Someone's got to throw away

737
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,400
Pull the rug right out from under us and do something crazy with this

738
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,704
How are you managing to sell a

739
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
$20

740
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,264
HD camera or a $30

741
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
Can camera

742
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,080
Yes so that is a topic

743
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:10,848
Question that we

744
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,640
Ultimately comes from

745
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,176
Core belief in what way

746
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
Starting this

747
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,016
High quality

748
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,064
Awesome technology products

749
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:26,720
Radar products

750
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,744
Things from

751
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
Efficiencies on a supply chain

752
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:34,144
To our sales channels

753
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,008
Customer

754
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,312
The porch and word-of-mouth

755
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
People telling people about our product

756
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,896
Parkour proponents of RC

757
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,272
Esl at the very lowest pop

758
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
Apple price

759
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
Because we believe that certain powers

760
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,392
You can do so much more when it camera cost

761
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,672
22 $30

762
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,488
You can buy five of them and play with them and do a lot of really

763
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
Creative things in

764
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,792
Court of what we're trying to do

765
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,328
So I have to ask

766
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,400
Do you actually make money on these things are you just

767
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,936
Venture-backed startup that's like

768
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,056
Seed round last year

769
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,360
Break even

770
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,408
So we are not this is not

771
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,224
Sword

772
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,528
Future on subscription

773
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,856
Are cameras come with free cloud storage and we are committed to doing that

774
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,160
We're not looking for other revenue streams

775
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,952
Okay so how do you achieve

776
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
Break even

777
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
Such

778
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,792
Incredibly low prices let's talk about

779
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
Manufacturing

780
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
How you came across

781
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
I hear building a business

782
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,680
Sure so we have an amazing man

783
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
Partner that we partner with end

784
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,312
One of the things we will look for as the ability to produce

785
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,360
So when we can

786
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,896
Scale

787
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,688
Recognized as cost efficiencies

788
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,856
You sold over 500000

789
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,648
Bring the pricing down

790
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Consumers

791
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,512
Holy cow 500000 of these things

792
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,304
That is

793
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
Amazing

794
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,352
Are people buying

795
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,656
Five or six or they bite

796
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
It's a lot of them

797
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,752
Sure so a lot of people buy one too

798
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,032
To start we see a lot of

799
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:20,640
People that don't really believe 4:20

800
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,688
$30 in

801
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,968
And then they come back

802
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,088
So are our average user has more than one camera a lot of people start with

803
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,952
Video is so expensive to host in the cloud I've seen a lot of

804
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
Startups offer

805
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,024
7 days or 14 days

806
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,584
Storage but then they're like holy cow

807
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,632
This is way too much money we have to charge

808
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,680
So how are you guys

809
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,960
Making that work

810
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,496
Because that is an ongoing cost

811
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Associated with

812
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
Every camera

813
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,336
Yeah and that's something that we price into r

814
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,688
Pricing so it was something that we forecasted in and accounted for from the beginning

815
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,968
How did you get the

816
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,760
Experience or how do you know

817
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,808
How accurate were your forecast

818
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Cast I guess is what I'm wondering

819
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,672
Perspective

820
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
People

821
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Obviously

822
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
I try to think about

823
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:11,072
Then give me the reality and they're like in Ark

824
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
Text well for a

825
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,656
Any number

826
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:15,936
Yeah

827
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
Sure

828
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,240
It's the one piece of it is

829
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,264
Cher

830
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,056
Local storage options with

831
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
The Cloud app

832
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,872
Adoption wolver

833
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,408
Record a 12-second clip

834
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,992
When the camera detects motion or sound

835
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,624
Search for local storage to be able to get continuous recording or longer Clips when there is

836
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208
People

837
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,536
SD card for local storage if they want more that longer

838
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
More storage time

839
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
Cloud storage

840
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
To those 12

841
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
Continuous

842
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,984
Recording all the way to an SD card

843
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,592
Yeah so you insert a microSD card in any of our cameras and there's two options

844
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:58,944
You can either send it to continuous record so it'll record 24/7

845
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,784
With a 32 gig card can get about two to three days

846
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,600
Footage automatically replace

847
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
What's the oldest

848
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,464
Only record when there's an event

849
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,024
So the camera work words in 1 minute increments

850
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,328
Reviews about 1 minute increment and if there is

851
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
It saves it

852
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,424
If there isn't

853
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
It doesn't for your customers

854
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,496
What percentage error using S

855
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,336
So we see about half of our customers will a democracy

856
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
SD card

857
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,224
What are your customers doing with this is it mostly security or they watching their dogs

858
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,504
Do you have a sense of that

859
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
Yeah we engaged

860
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,856
Customers pretty regularly and we have a very robust

861
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,880
Community vet

862
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,160
Just in case

863
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,560
Are firmware or are at

864
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,840
Also Alpha test

865
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
Testing new products

866
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
That we're working on

867
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,936
We get a lot of visibility and I would say

868
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,752
There's a fair number of people that are looking for that traditional stuff

869
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,312
Security or keeping an eye on their house

870
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,104
Create

871
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,432
Size of the price point brats

872
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,248
People will set them up to watch there

873
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,552
3D printer and watch the progress Theron

874
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:11,392
For errors during printing

875
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,184
Or put it in the crawl space

876
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,744
Maybe just stick it in their garage to be able to

877
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
Please check if I remembered

878
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
Close the garage

879
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,352
Morning people using in a lot of

880
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,120
Creative ways

881
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,144
We had one user

882
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,984
Actually set it up in the nursery

883
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,312
Actually brought them to

884
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,592
Monitor the breathing

885
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
His infant child

886
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:32,896
Based on the

887
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,200
Feed from our camera

888
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,224
That's a lot of

889
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,552
People like to Tinker we have a very

890
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,392
And I find that interesting because I mean yes

891
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
The price point

892
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
I'm totally like

893
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
Why wouldn't you just buy

894
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
$30

895
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
But it also seems like

896
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,048
A very mainstream

897
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,840
Thanks for someone who looks at a nest cam inside

898
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:55,168
Like that's $200 and I'm not really sure I need a camera

899
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,704
So what is your audience

900
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
What is the makeup

901
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
What percentage is

902
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,288
Like more mainstream purses

903
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,824
People who are crazy

904
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,896
Bret whissel mix

905
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
It's a challenge for us

906
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
To be able to make a product that Appeals

907
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,808
I think at lunch it was very much

908
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,368
Tinkerer community

909
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
We saw this is

910
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,952
Really cool products

911
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,488
How hard it was for us

912
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,816
To deliver a product

913
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
With the specs

914
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,376
Teachers are cameras have

915
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
At the price that we are

916
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
People were very much I think in that

917
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,288
Continue to engage

918
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,104
Like I was saying on the beta in the product development

919
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
But as the product

920
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:42,016
Places like Amazon and website

921
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,576
We started to get more people that worries

922
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,344
Sisterly

923
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,160
Community are just a more mainstream

924
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,464
Person looking for a baby monitor

925
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,000
Or a way to check

926
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,072
And so making sure that

927
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,376
Easy and the US

928
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:01,472
The simple for people that have never used before

929
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,752
Is a big part of what we

930
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,032
We do we think about

931
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,056
Got it

932
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
Really easy

933
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
I did appreciate

934
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,688
So let's go back to the

935
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
$20

936
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,992
When we talked

937
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:13,760
Probably

938
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
Not a year ago maybe

939
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,576
I don't remember when this

940
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,880
But after it initially launched

941
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,440
You talked about you guys are from Amazon

942
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,000
And kind of the founding ethos

943
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
And how

944
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
You guys envisioned

945
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
The future of the smartphone

946
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,120
Can you talk a little bit about that

947
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,656
Sure yes of the

948
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:34,496
Four of us who founded wise Matt while we're working at Amazon

949
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
Very close ties

950
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,104
Believe in that same ethos of

951
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
Customer-centric

952
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
Experience

953
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,688
Everything that we

954
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,248
Is centered around feedback from

955
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,296
Are users and continuing to improve

956
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,832
Experience and so

957
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,112
You're at lunch we had a

958
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,136
Pretty simple

959
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,440
Camera with focus on a camera

960
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,464
And worked

961
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,656
Cameron more and more valuable

962
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,424
Overtime

963
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,728
The listening to our user as finding out what

964
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
Features they want

965
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
Find firmware updates

966
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,616
Our biggest announcement was last week

967
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,456
Set Alexa certification

968
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,784
Camera

969
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,832
It was especially challenging for us

970
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,392
Because we did have limitations from a hardware

971
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,208
Because of the price we don't have

972
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
Robust internal

973
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,256
Components

974
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,792
Extra hard to get that

975
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,840
Certification and make it work with our Hardware

976
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,144
Okay and then the first one to Jen when it does

977
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:43,616
Upgraded some of the internal components between

978
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,640
2 Gentoo

979
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
Or that planet

980
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,456
Features like Alexa

981
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,992
Because gen 1 components

982
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,272
Didn't support it

983
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,112
So we did not increase the price for a customer is it

984
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,440
Price for our cameras even though we moved

985
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
Json better internal components to

986
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,000
Plan for the future

987
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,560
And yet you're still break-even how did that happen

988
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:09,472
Supply chain side and given the volume that we were able to secure a component

989
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,008
Price that worked for us

990
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,384
And do you guys design the camera or did you find someone who made a really good camera

991
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,664
Opponents at a low cost

992
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,432
How did that work

993
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,272
Yes at the manufacturing partner that we work with sdp

994
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:25,344
Experience making cameras and so you will actually

995
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,184
Other cameras that have a similar industrial design to ferment

996
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
External pressure

997
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,744
Respective look the same as ours

998
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,304
So we license the industrial design the overall

999
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
Outside

1000
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,912
Customize the internal components

1001
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,216
Android our own firmware and software

1002
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
To customize

1003
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,288
Cameras for ru sinforoso

1004
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,336
While the camera may look the same as

1005
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,128
Border cameras out there

1006
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,176
It's not compatible and it's a completely different

1007
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
My camera

1008
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
From an internal

1009
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,552
And this is a Chinese manufacturer

1010
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
Piss

1011
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,880
Okay cuz a lot of people in there

1012
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:04,768
Can't believe it's so cheap effort have looked at like their packets and where those go and they noticed that some of them go to

1013
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,328
China and they were a little concerned about that

1014
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,352
Do you want to talk about

1015
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,376
Why that might be

1016
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,960
We did see some comments from customers of this is early feedback.

1017
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,080
I just are two pieces of this so one piece

1018
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:22,688
Peer-to-peer connection that's made between the phone and the camera

1019
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,224
And we using

1020
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,760
Actual service from that it was

1021
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,296
The commercial service from a

1022
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,088
Pretty standard company that does that

1023
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
Rivers all over the world

1024
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,720
So we were just using never server happened

1025
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,000
At the time

1026
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
Customer was calling up

1027
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
So we

1028
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,960
Went back to that service provider

1029
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,520
She worked with them to restrict

1030
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,544
Our traffic

1031
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
To us server

1032
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,640
So far cameras

1033
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,503
And then you guys do all the software here and there hosted here

1034
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
Correct

1035
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,295
Yes it's all

1036
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,575
Nawsa

1037
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
Weird

1038
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,927
Let's go back to the integration with

1039
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,695
Anime

1040
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,255
I know that a lot of your customers were asked

1041
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
That's so

1042
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:14,399
I'm assuming that's why you went first but are you looking for new partners or you going to do this with other

1043
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
Vendors as well

1044
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,447
This was

1045
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
Based on customer

1046
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:22,847
D-backs we put out a surveys on a number of different areas asking customers what kind of integration

1047
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,871
State wanted

1048
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,919
And so

1049
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,711
Madam

1050
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:32,319
Top requested that was the first one we started working on

1051
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,367
We did actually integrate with if

1052
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,647
TT first

1053
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,951
That was our first integration that we announce

1054
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,231
About a month ago

1055
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,047
And we will continue to look at other options again

1056
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,071
It'll be based on what

1057
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:43,839
Customers are off

1058
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
Asking for

1059
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,887
And how does that affect

1060
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,703
Your cost as you start thinking about going for it

1061
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
Madam

1062
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
Is there a limit

1063
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,311
There definitely are cost associated with

1064
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
With those

1065
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,127
Cost benefit analysis

1066
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
So

1067
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,455
There's a cost associated with it but it also

1068
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,479
Opens us up to

1069
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,783
Just so many more users and makes our products

1070
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,807
So much more you

1071
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
Useful to Arco

1072
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,183
Sides of that and we make a business decision

1073
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,999
Ultimately were looking to provide the best

1074
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,535
Restaurants to our users because

1075
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,071
Ultimately

1076
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607
Bring more people into the Paw

1077
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,911
As we scale we can sense

1078
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
Poor tire cost with other

1079
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
Integrations

1080
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:27,871
It is the cool to be talked about providing low-cost products and doing a really awesome job at the software and

1081
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:32,735
Cervicide is the coldest just be a camera company or you going to add more stuff more features

1082
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,063
Yeah sure and I do want to be clear that

1083
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Why we offer

1084
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,879
You're awesome prices are goals not to

1085
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
To be the low cost

1086
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,951
Option and that's not we hope that's not white

1087
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:45,023
Camera is our goal is always to make an awesome

1088
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:45,791
Camera

1089
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,583
The fact that only cost $20

1090
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,351
Is an added

1091
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,631
Are cameras

1092
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,423
Perform peer-to-peer spot

1093
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,983
I would say all of the mainstream camera

1094
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
Lights out there

1095
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,799
So why is the nest

1096
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,079
10 times more expensive

1097
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,127
Good question for NASA

1098
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,407
I would look at

1099
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:07,039
They have a very different distribution model so when you're in large retail stores there's a

1100
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,879
Chrysler profit that goes to that retail Channel there is

1101
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,671
Profitability of the company itself

1102
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,719
There's marketing branding

1103
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Sea lard

1104
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,279
Corporate sponsorships

1105
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,327
Large celebrity sponsorship

1106
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,351
Those are things

1107
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:23,423
We pay for his customers and we don't think our

1108
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,031
Customers want to pay for all of that out really just focus on what is the cost

1109
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,311
Making an awesome product

1110
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,335
And so

1111
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
Okay sorry

1112
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,407
Now you can go back to

1113
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
To telling me

1114
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
What you guys

1115
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,575
Teachers and continue to improve our

1116
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
Testing products

1117
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,879
It support them overtime

1118
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,975
We are looking at other cameras as well so

1119
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,535
I don't think the secret that a lot of our customers ask for

1120
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,815
For an outdoor camera

1121
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
So that is something that

1122
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,631
We have on our radar it's

1123
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,935
Yeah that's a challenging thing to do so it will take a

1124
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,983
That is something we have

1125
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
Topper

1126
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:05,151
Concrete

1127
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,199
Share or announce

1128
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,991
We do hope to go beyond cameras

1129
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,807
Awesome in final question for you

1130
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
Let's talk about

1131
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,599
Security and privacy

1132
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,623
Because he's our big issues

1133
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
With cameras

1134
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,207
So what kind of security steps are you guys

1135
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:22,559
Is taking both to encourage users to behave better and then also on your end

1136
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
And to make sure

1137
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,911
Yes definitely

1138
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,447
Security and safety is

1139
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,495
Top priority for us incredibly in

1140
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,847
The huge responsibility for us

1141
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,175
When customers bring a camera of ours into their home and

1142
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
Take that

1143
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Paramount

1144
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,527
So we

1145
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,575
Stuck on the security side

1146
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,391
The AWS servers all of this

1147
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,927
Connections are made

1148
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,695
Bhcc

1149
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,463
GPS

1150
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,999
For the alert videos

1151
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,047
We use symmetric and asymmetric

1152
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,095
Consistent hashing and some other

1153
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,119
Things on the back end

1154
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,935
Make sure that our user information is to

1155
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,215
Secure and can't be

1156
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:01,983
Stolen

1157
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,263
And then what about privacy

1158
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,543
What is your philosophy

1159
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
Sofia round

1160
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,335
Customer data

1161
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,359
Yeah

1162
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,383
Of course

1163
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
Thinking about that as

1164
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
Oliver

1165
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,271
LifeStream connections are done via UPS

1166
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,319
Peer-to-peer connection between the

1167
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,367
Users phone and the camera so

1168
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,439
Has no visibility into that

1169
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,975
For all of the

1170
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,279
Alert videos that are stored in the cloud

1171
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,095
Those are directly from the cloud to

1172
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,631
Users and wise

1173
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,191
The individual videos of r

1174
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,263
And also to give our users more control over their private

1175
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,543
Jesse we really focus on

1176
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,567
Features within the app

1177
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,847
To be able to turn off

1178
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:42,687
The camera for for example turn off sound in the recording of videos

1179
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,711
So

1180
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,735
Our recent app

1181
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,271

Turn on and off the camera

1183
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,599
And with Integrations with

You can actually use geolocation I use the location of your phone

1185
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
To control the on-off

1186
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,535
Your camera so that you can turn it off when you're at home

1187
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,095
