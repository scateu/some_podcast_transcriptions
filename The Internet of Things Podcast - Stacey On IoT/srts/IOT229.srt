Stacy

48
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
Already

49
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
Kevin

50
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,384
You know the last couple shows we've kicked off with the news that

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Hey

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
Insert tech company here listen to your voice recording for

53
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,808
Quality assurance and has contractors paid to do that

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,112
And this week we find out that

55
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
Facebook

56
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
Insert Facebook here

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
As we've been talking about it

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
The biggest she was leasing for going to contractors

59
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,864
And people are listening to things that P

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
People thought only machines

61
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,240
I would say the other issue is that it's going to contractors and not him

62
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,800
Please because contractors have a little bit less

63
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
You know loyalty I would say to a

64
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
Company sold

65
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,968
They may sign an NDA but they may feel free to share the

66
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,016
Did you see pets with their friends wearing

67
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,832
Employee-employer relationship has

68
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
Little bit more

69
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
Heft

70
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,648
2in lights

71
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:11,744
Right yeah this is found out by Bloomberg

72
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
According to

73
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:19,168
Them Facebook has told them that they actually stopped his practice about a week ago so

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,288
It's not that they're currently doing it none of the company's alright I believe doing it now that we talked about

75
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,592
Including Apple Google and Amazon

76
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,432
But yeah some contractors even named the

77
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,760
Company taskus was the name of the contractor

78
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,552
Some of those employees Hertz

79
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,648
Conversations and other things they probably shouldn't have heard and

80
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
Kind of spoke to Bloomberg anonymously on this

81
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
The issue is that that

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,584
It's gone cuz this isn't happening anymore

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,680
But it's nice to see that we saw these companies are updating their terms of service

84
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
To be explicit about

85
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,568
Transcription Services people could be listening and so on and

86
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,640
Facebook does not have that in their terms of service yet I don't believe it

87
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,944
Added it so I am not sure how they're going to handle

88
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
And I thought some companies

89
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,344
They would let you opt out but they were still sending a small amount

90
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
If their work

91
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
Glad it's over.

92
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,952
I know Apple said they stopped

93
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
But I believe Google and Amazon stick

94
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,559
Google let's shoot

95
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,887
An Amazon Alexa to opt-out

96
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,471
Facebook doesn't let you opt out but they have apparently stopped

97
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:30,079
Is Facebook's case I think it's a little more specific because this all started when they

98
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,407
Adding voice transcription to Messenger

99
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,479
So you can have your voice chats transcribed and I

100
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
Where's the other companies were doing it too

101
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,087
Verify that

102
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,183
The Voice Services were working as expected so to speak

103
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
That is a live

104
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,815
But yeah I need anytime we're going to have a eye or

105
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
Any sort of computer

106
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,423
Do something for us there's going to be a human in the loop

107
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
Eventually to check

108
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
To make sure things are proceeding

109
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
You're supposed to

110
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543
It's just basically

111
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:05,151
It's testing Avenue want to test that the system you design is working as intended

112
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,711
And it doesn't get weird

113
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
Piss

114
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,295
The thing we know about any sort of a eyes

115
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,599
You know left to his own devices for long enough

116
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
Can't get weird

117
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
CD tree

118
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,207
Well actually see our next topic

119
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
Excellent you're right

120
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
All right

121
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
Just keep going let's keep going

122
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,215
Scariest continues its Amazon rekognition this time which is

123
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:34,079
Amazon's face analysis system that we took

124
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:38,431
Police agencies have actually used the there's been a lot of

125
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,295
Debate over it because their facial recognition is not as accurate as

126
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
Definitely skewed

127
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,671
When their people colors that are being analyzed

128
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
It's not a

129
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,743
A great thing in my opinion

130
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,559
But they have

131
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
They added

132
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,655
A new emotion that Amazon rekognition can

133
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Detect

134
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
Beer

135
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,519
And that's real

136
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,823
They've already been able to

137
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,175
Look for happy sad angry surprised disgusted comment confused

138
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
We can prove that your emotions

139
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
But now they've added

140
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Pierce

141
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,623
I just worry when a system can do this hoot how it will be used

142
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
I guess against us

143
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
Yeah

144
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
Or even just to manipulate us

145
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,023
I mean it doesn't have to be

146
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
Malicious it could just be

147
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
Just to bring up

148
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:36,031
Hot Topic here in the States you could have political ads for example when you could see it

149
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,311
They tried fear

150
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
With people or

151
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Etcetera

152
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Oh yeah

153
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
Can you sell fewer products

154
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
With happy ads than you do

155
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Do with that

156
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Engender

157
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
So

158
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,831
There's that but there's also things like

159
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
Hey if you're

160
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,695
If your phone early nearby camera recognizes that you're

161
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231
You're sad

162
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
Maybe it'll send you

163
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Coupon for an ice cream

164
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,607
Even though maybe you don't want the ice cream

165
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
But you're sad

166
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
Add and you don't make it feel better

167
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,983
And those kind of things I think

168
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
Really

169
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
Insidious

170
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
Insidious good word

171
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,943
Isn't it though I bet we'll use that again

172
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
That's where we're going

173
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
With all of this

174
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,599
And I also would like to see so this is just a little blog item for

175
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,135
AWS butt

176
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,951
When they talk about improving accuracy

177
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
I would like to see their percentages

178
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,095
You know so anytime you're dealing with something like this you're getting up probability

179
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,375
Anytime you got a machine

180
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Learning

181
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
Something you're getting

182
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,215
I'm ninety something percent

183
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Sure

184
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
That this person is

185
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
I think we should start

186
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Calling

187
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
For that sort of

188
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Information

189
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
I know that they're going to say

190
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
Proprietary and they don't want to talk about it

191
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,783
But I think that's actually really important especially if we're going to be

192
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Pulling the center

193
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
Service for

194
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
Policing

195
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
I want to know that

196
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
If someone says they're surprised

197
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Disgusted

198
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Before

199
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,351
Does facial recognition said they were disgusted and angry beforehand

200
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
And I really think it's important if we're going to

201
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,727
Decided that's valid that we get percentages about

202
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
How sure the system is

203
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
And how short is for

204
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
Men vs women

205
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
White people versus black people

206
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,503
That's just me thinking about down the road is a

207
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Lyerly figure

208
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
Cuz I think that's going to

209
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
Color people's Perceptions in a way that

210
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
Absolutely

211
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,047
I feel like a six-year-old I don't think it's fair if it's not right

212
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
Excuse me is that what you think

213
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
So

214
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
Well I guess let's move on to some

215
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,495
Happy news

216
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:47,871
Brilliant the light switches that are very expensive and become a point of integration for your entire smart

217
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,455
They have now added native lifx support

218
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,015
Participative right lifx Wi-Fi

219
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
And other

220
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
This is

221
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
Useful so I tried Brillion

222
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
Probably a year ago

223
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,207
I had a really bad experience because they were

224
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
Really tricky

225
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
To install

226
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,583
And then I had a brilliant person come out and install a new panel for me

227
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
He even said it was trick

228
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
But

229
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,239
When they were working properly

230
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,055
They were little too much for me

231
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Personally

232
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,639
But I could integrate all of my life

233
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
Is my Nest to my Sonos

234
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,295
I could actually do a lot from these light switches it was a big upfront

235
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
Time investment

236
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,135
But for someone who wants to have

237
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
Instead of like a

238
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
Amazon Echo 2

239
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,303
It felt almost like having like a savant or a

240
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
Control 4 system

241
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
That you programmed yourself

242
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,423
It didn't have the AP

243
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Functionality but

244
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
This is probably

245
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,103
No switch for everybody because as you said it's for you is too much I mean it's got to

246
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
Touch screen

247
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Scott sensors

248
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
That's

249
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
Would you call him

250
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
Touch sliders like

251
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,807
2-din sliders dim there at

252
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
Capacitive touch Sliders in

253
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
Actually one of the biggest you I can

254
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
Complaints I had about toes

255
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,279
Sometimes you just want to slap a light switch and have it work it this I had to

256
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
Look at your finger in the groove

257
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
At the same time

258
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,703
They're nice yeah they're very contemporary modern looking in

259
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,031
If you like that look it's obviously a larger than a regular

260
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
Switch because that

261
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,383
Touchscreen independent divots for the dinning

262
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Uncensored

263
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
To become a

264
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Whole home internet

265
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,271
If you have them all over your home they become a whole home

266
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Yeah

267
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,879
I wouldn't want these in every room that's what I would say

268
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
But I'm intrigued because I do

269
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
Adopted for Life X

270
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Extra color bulb

271
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
Versus you with

272
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Junior color bulbs

273
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,095
Maybe now's the time how much are they

274
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
Brilliant light switches

275
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,495
Okay for a single switch control which is essentially just a touch screen

276
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
That is 299

277
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,175
When you go to a two switch control 34093 switches a399 for switches

278
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,223
Is 449

279
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
These are not cheap

280
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,367
But they do act as this integration

281
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
Again

282
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Them too much

283
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
Yeah they work with a ton of stop

284
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
Connect to Sonos nest

285
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303
Ring hue ecobee

286
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
Hilton madhumeh

287
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Very nice

288
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,423
Yeah once you install them correctly which I have

289
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Recommend

290
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
All right

291
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,103
They have left EXO Now Kevin there may not be

292
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
I think they're a little too

293
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:34,271
I think so considering that really only have one life Expo

294
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
Okay

295
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,879
Other Partnerships or Integrations LG and Lumia

296
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
This is something

297
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
China

298
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:47,071
But LG and Lemme have collaborated to create AI based smart home services

299
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
What is this mean

300
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
But first we should tell you who

301
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Lumia

302
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,983
Yeah Lumi is considered by one of the largest

303
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
Iot companies in China

304
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
It was founded in Shenzhen which is like the

305
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,687
Electronics capital of the world everything is made knocked off

306
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
Sold Etc

307
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
Horses eating at

308
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,087
Lumia sold 100 million devices

309
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
As of the end of 2018

310
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,975
They've got smart sensors and Gateway so get ahold of ecosystem

311
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,559
United States

312
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
But now I know I haven't seen the prize it's it's

313
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
China sails

314
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
Yes but

315
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Bradley

316
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,775
I like this deal cuz it's like hey

317
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,823
These two big companies have

318
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Created

319
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
Automations that work automatic

320
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,687
Your stuff so you don't have to set it up

321
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,271
But if you have this Lumi sensor and have the LG air conditioning

322
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,087
You didn't you can turn it on so it basically

323
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,903
Uses that sensor is an external sensor

324
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Your air conditioning

325
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
This is cool

326
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,303
In many ways because it makes the smart home easier for

327
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,119
People it's a bummer in the sense that

328
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
Oh my gosh you're going to have to rely on all of your

329
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,799
Device makers and Appliance makers to decide to opt into in

330
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Integration testing

331
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Which

332
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Psy

333
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
It's going to take awhile

334
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,735
And has a possibility of going away as we

335
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
We see with

336
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
What will happen if you

337
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
This month with Nest shutting down at work

338
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,975
You know it's kind of interesting and I don't know the answer to this question but I'm wondering

339
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
What Louise voice

340
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,119
+ smart speaker integration Tsar

341
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
Because it's China

342
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
I don't know

343
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
Number one but never

344
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,287
Probably but then again

345
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,871
Here we have LG has integrated with

346
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
Padme and some tablets

347
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,735
Take me to we turn your tablet into a smart

348
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,807
Speaker Echo Show like device so

349
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,671
But you're probably right I would imagine a Chinese just Baidu maybe not in the Amazon integration

350
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
Google

351
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
Ask if they have contra

352
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
Will add them to the list when they do

353
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
Okay

354
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
And in a partnership

355
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
Breakdown

356
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
Cortana

357
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,055
Was removed from the glass thermostat

358
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
How many people bought this

359
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,639
Is a Johnson Controls

360
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
Glass

361
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
Glass thermostat

362
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
Is beautiful

363
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
It is beautiful

364
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
But

365
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
It came with Microsoft Cortana we were

366
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:23,487
And Johnson Controls then bought Lux products which is a smart home thermostats

367
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
Maker

368
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
And take that deals with both Google

369
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
In Amazon

370
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
And I'm sure that

371
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,679
Anybody who brought the glass with love Frances ha

372
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Google Earth

373
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,543
And Microsoft is getting out of the smart home a spy

374
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,615
Cortana she's going to be virtual assistant for the Enterprise

375
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
So this totally makes

376
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:47,807
Did you have one of these have been notified about this yet but it looks like glass I said moving forward you have other voices

377
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:51,391
Distance through the works with functionality of Madame a and

378
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
Awesome

379
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
Another breakdown

380
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,303
We've been getting reports that the Google home and wink

381
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
The wink link

382
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
Is now week

383
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
No it's non-existent

384
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
Somewhere between those two clouds

385
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
There was a breakdown

386
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,823
And both Google and pink thought it would be

387
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
Be fixed but so far

388
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,223
Right before we started this show recording I

389
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,295
Testing mine again cuz I noticed it for about 3 days and

390
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
Now she says that

391
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
I cannot connect to wink right now

392
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
That is a bummer

393
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
And

394
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,487
Be aware that both parties are

395
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Aware of it

396
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
And they're working on it

397
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
It's a little disconcerting.

398
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,471
And what I'm doing in the meantime as I'm just using my Wink app

399
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,287
Getting out your phone

400
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
It's always happening

401
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
And

402
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,199
Another breakdown cash so many divorces

403
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
The tp-link

404
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Casa

405
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
System

406
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,831
Which makes a line of wonderful smart

407
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Ground plugs

408
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
They

409
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Are not going to

410
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:01,023
Yeah and they said back in January that they were so it's a total reversal at this point

411
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,327
It's not going to get the update the smart plug Mini

412
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,167
Get updates in the future

413
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
Right so

414
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
We are sad

415
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
Or at least kind of

416
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Flummoxed

417
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
Mend

418
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
I feel like we're like TMZ or something

419
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,223
Like that has dating show

420
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
The iot paparazzi are out

421
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
But

422
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
Removing off

423
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
Partnerships

424
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
More scary stuff

425
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,743
Monster High stuff

426
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,303
A break from our light and happy news to

427
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
Alright at Defcon

428
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,215
My favorite show that I would never attend because I'm terrified of getting

429
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
Completely hacked

430
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
We're screwed over at some point in time

431
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
Sorry y'all

432
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,359
But I do love you and I love talking to

433
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
To all the people who do this

434
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
But

435
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,271
There was a researcher who basically demonstrated malware that they could stick

436
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
On any sort of speaker system

437
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
And then use that

438
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,719
It said I need physical or remote access to the device but once it's on there

439
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
They can actually

440
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,071
Melt the speaker components

441
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:11,679
By sending out these high-pitched frequencies and also possibly damage

442
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
People in

443
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
I don't know animals they didn't test it on

444
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,799
People are animals so we're not sure how that damage

445
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
It wasn't good

446
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:24,991
Yeah I just like smart speakers as you said any speaker so a laptop speaker

447
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
Your phone speaker a Bluetooth speaker

448
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,599
Headstones xiamen

449
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
I mean all kinds

450
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,415
Speakers

451
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,975
Yeah like if we were at the Muse the work

452
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,535
Insidious we could actually insert the

453
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,119
Frequency in this podcast and melt everybody smart speakers

454
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
So we're not.

455
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
But we could do that

456
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
You would have known that's true

457
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
But yes

458
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
We could be in City

459
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Play it

460
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
Terrifying

461
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,991
I'll link is back to the mystery of Cuba where we had us diplomats in Cuba

462
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
Had something

463
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Happen

464
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Weather

465
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,391
Carrying their heads I don't even know

466
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,975
Nobody knows

467
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
It's it's like the Bermuda Triangle

468
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
Don't know their butt

469
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
Keep an eye out

470
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
On that and then the other thing from

471
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,423
Defcon did I just

472
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,495
I don't think it's funny I just think it's a case of

473
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Old people

474
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
Look at us

475
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:24,383
Was this idea I'm sure you guys saw that the Avaya desk phones

476
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
Now are vulnerable

477
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,735
What's interesting about it isn't that you're invited us phone is wrong

478
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
Logo patch

479
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,599
It's that this is a vulnerability that is 10 years old

480
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,879
When it was found

481
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
Avaya actually issued a patch

482
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,255
What happened then is some point in time later

483
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,655
The forked the code for the phones and use the old unpatched version

484
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
So then

485
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
Reintroduce the vulnerability

486
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
Good news is they have a patch

487
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,383
Version Control revision Control

488
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,455
I just thought this was a perfect example I picture it like

489
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:07,391
If you're dealing with code inside

490
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Source code

491
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
Control system whatever you use

492
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,279
And you got 10 years or so

493
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,095
Cotrip single devices or devices

494
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
This kind of oversight

495
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,423
Unfortunate going to happen

496
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:26,079
Outside of Defcon we also got news late last week about hallways new operating

497
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
This is the

498
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
Harmony OS

499
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,711
Are humming OS

500
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
In Chinese

501
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
Speaking Mandarin

502
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
But

503
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,879
They say they can switch over from Android and this is a big deal because

504
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,903
Cuz

505
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,975
The US government has decided that no Huawei

506
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,839
Short version of that which means companies from the US like Google

507
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,911
Have to pull their stuff from Huawei they can't

508
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
What's my name

509
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Which means

510
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
No Android

511
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
This is bad

512
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
What ways has

513
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,407
That's okay cuz we've got the harmony iOS which is actually designed for the

514
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
And

515
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:09,087
Also smartphones but it'll be smart phone smart speakers sensors blah blah blah

516
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,183
And it makes me wonder like this is what Google's fuchsia OS has you know

517
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,351
I was just going to say that because why we've been working on this since 2017 we've since found out we know

518
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,935
That's this is their back-up plan to Android and as you said

519
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,263
It's going to actually start on smart TVs

520
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,359
But it is a microcurrent when open source microkernel

521
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,919
Which fuchsia is also a

522
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Source

523
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Maybe

524
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:43,135
I think Google's been working on and we still don't know a lot about that but I suspect these are like mirror

525
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
Like approaches

526
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
To bring a

527
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Standard

528
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,255
Corset of

529
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,607
Features and functions that can scale across any device by size or

530
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Screen

531
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,167
Size as well

532
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
Even though scream

533
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Exactly

534
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,895
And that makes sense because that's where we are going we're going to need a OS is that

535
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,223
Work across everything because otherwise developers are going to

536
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
Hate your butt for

537
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,159
Seeking a developer setting platform so I did catch some interesting information that

538
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,464
If and when we bring this to

539
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
Phones work

540
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,280
Things that run Android today

541
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,912
That Huawei has a conversion program to convert an Android APK which is a

542
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,008
Basically zip file of all the Android components for programs

543
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,056
That will work on Harmony OS

544
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
Nice

545
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,712
And our final bit of news today is from

546
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,760
The nrdc

547
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,808
This is an environmental

548
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
NGO

549
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
And

550
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,648
They protect the animals protect

551
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,928
Environment protect Airport

552
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,232
Somebody has to do so

553
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
We're not

554
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:58,144
So they actually retained a company called Pacific Crest labs to test the power consumption

555
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,704
Smart speakers and video streaming

556
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
And as you can imagine

557
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
There are

558
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
Problems

559
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
Efficiency

560
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,640
Generally the research says

561
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
Hey

562
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,712
These devices are pretty energy efficient

563
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
But

564
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
When you link for example a smart speaker

565
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
Television

566
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,392
It causes it standby power in overall annual

567
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,928
Energy used to Skyrock

568
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,000
That's because basically the TV doesn't go to sleep

569
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,536
So they're saying hey

570
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,096
Maybe you can make the TV models go to sleep

571
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
When

572
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,424
They're connected to a Smart speaker

573
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
Some people do this some

574
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
People don't

575
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
But

576
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,776
I was like oh

577
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,336
That's kind of a bummer cuz I'm sitting here

578
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,408
Because I've got a Chromecast plugged in and

579
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
I've got it connected to my

580
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Google Assistant

581
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,040
I don't know if Google is one of those people

582
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,624
Yeah I don't know I mean since a guideline that they're trying to get

583
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,952
Device makers to start following because they say

584
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,536
The spike in energy consumption from the always listening bits

585
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,840
Could exceed a billion dollars annually

586
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:05,472
The device makers could actually Implement something that you know that makes it more efficient as you were saying

587
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,056
You can just give us a scheduling thing

588
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,592
Smart speakers that says hey

589
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,920
Pretty much asleep for my 10 at night till 6 p.m.

590
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,480
No he's downstairs watching TV

591
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,552
Can you just not be listening from 10 to 6 p.m.

592
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
Yeah

593
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,368
Exactly and

594
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
There we go

595
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,184
They gave a chart full of

596
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,536
On Power vs standby power in a variety of devices

597
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
And some of them

598
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
Surprisingly

599
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
The Apple homepod

600
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424
Consumes a lot

601
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
Of energy

602
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,752
Turn on power mode

603
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
In terms of Watts

604
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,664
The Google home is 2.2 the Amazon Echo is 2.4 Watts

605
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,480
Apple homepod as 5.91

606
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Which

607
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
Holy cow

608
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
What is it doing

609
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,696
I don't know I know it's a very heavy and have to device but not that I had much to do with it

610
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:04,352
I see if these devices get bigger they seem to be using more power like the Google home mini the smallest amongst this test

611
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,912
Purposely 1.7 watch when it's on

612
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
Yeah but that's

613
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
1.7 vs

614
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
2.46

615
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,592
Yeah 2.44 the Hub

616
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Okay

617
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
Well

618
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
I don't know about that

619
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,712
Unplug everything

620
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:23,040
We are plugging in a lot more things I thought we would stop plugging

621
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,904
Note this is why I'm changing all my Outlets to add like USB

622
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,720
Reports and such because I'm running out of outlets

623
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:36,864
Well and if you imagine something like the wireless power Consortium like bringing the tri-power not just to like

624
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
Connected devices

625
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,192
Imagine they have an effort to put it in

626
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
Kitchens

627
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
If you're not even aware

628
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,104
Of what has wires you just said it in places

629
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,408
Imagine how that might Skyrocket

630
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
The use of things

631
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Need to be charged

632
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
Well I say

633
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,040
Is wireless charging

634
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,344
Under the floors and everything will just

635
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
Wirelessly magically

636
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
Evil be baked in

637
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,208
NRF Olga

638
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:06,048
I might lose my hair and grow a third arm but hey everything's chart

639
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584
It might be warm

640
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
History like radiant heat

641
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,520
Pick up good for news we didn't have a ton of great news this week

642
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
Attentive

643

You have a really good chance of winning that ecobee

664
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Oh yeah

665
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
And it's a good Smart Switch

666
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Yep

667
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,936
If you're into that sort of thing

668
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Go for it

669
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
So

670
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,800
This week's question is from

671
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
Rent

672
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Let's hear it

673
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
Hello this is Brent from Utah I am

674
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,296
I have an older home and very small bathroom

675
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,344
With no fan

676
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
And the humidity gets

677
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,928
And then I gets crazy cuz up to six

678
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,720
60 65%

679
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
Listen to take a shower or bath

680
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,072
And a fan but I'd love to her

681
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
The fan run automatically

682
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,192
Until it produces dantu

683
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,288
30% humidity temp step point

684
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,128
I think also that would want to be able to hit the fan and have it run

685
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,456
For 15 minutes or just turn the fan on and leave it running

686
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
CC IMAX

687
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,296
Accessing turning it on leaving it on

688
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,576
Until it drops

689
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,624
And also way to trigger it is

690
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,672
It's not even at the humidity so I can get

691
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,720
Bad smells out of the way

692
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Thanks for your help

693
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:17,120
Oh Brent this is such a good question because Kevin has already done the research because he wanted to

694
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
You do the same thing

695
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,728
I did half of it actually bought a product I just didn't install it yet

696
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
Basically

697
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,848
You can go to your local Lowe's Home Depot Etc

698
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,432
And check the shelves for bathroom exhaust fans

699
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,992
But have integrated humidity sensors in them

700
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
Again I bought ones

701
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,552
I did not

702
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,136
Actually install it yes I can't tell you how well it works but there's a range of these

703
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
Depending on the

704
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:45,536
Amount of air that you need moved any features you want some headlights in them and such

705
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560
I found one

706
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,888
Kind of like better than one I bought it's a NuTone

707
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,936
Odyssey 1

708
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
10

709
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,288
CFM ceiling bathroom exhaust fan with humidity sensor

710
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,664
He's $139 it has a small integrated light in it which is just a nice add-on

711
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:05,760
And basically I think this will do what you needed to do

712
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,064
I say that because I look at the specs

713
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,136
You can adjust the set point of humidity

714
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,720
So that it's anywhere between 50 and 80% and if

715
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:19,328
Can recognize that the humidity levels in that range that you said

716
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,120
He will automatically turn on

717
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
For you

718
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:27,520
He will also stay on for user adjustable 5 to 60 minutes once the set point

719
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:32,384
Is Matt so once the humidity drops say below 50% if you want it set for the max

720
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
You can have it stay on for 5 to 60 minutes

721
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,736
And since it automatically goes on

722
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
You don't have to like turn it on when there's

723
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,088
It just will do it for you

724
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,904
So I think that will really meet your needs however

725
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,464
I know Stacy was looking at another potential option

726
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,744
Yes there are two

727
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:52,096
The first is if you want to make this whole thing smart

728
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,168
You can buy a normal exhaust fan

729
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
Install it

730
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,496
And then put a Smart Switch on it

731
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
And then buy a humidity sensor

732
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,312
Connect those two

733
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,128
That's a lot of work and you said you had an old home

734
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
So you may not have a neutral wire

735
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,688
Smart Switch

736
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,224
So I found something even easier

737
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
You can buy an awair glow

738
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,344
For about 90 bucks they might even be 79

739
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Buy this thing

740
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
It's a

741
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,440
Indoor air quality monitor

742
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
Plug-in

743
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,816
A dehumidifier so you have to buy a separate little dehumidify

744
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:27,680
And then when the humidity gets to a certain point that the aware says it's not great

745
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,216
And I think you can actually set that

746
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
Do I actually turn on

747
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,312
Your dehumidifier for you and then turn it off

748
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,616
Either at a time setting or when the

749
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
Humidity has dropped

750
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,968
That is the no install

751
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,040
Way but it's going to be super easy

752
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,344
Then you have like a dehumidifier sitting in your bathroom

753
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,904
It doesn't address your

754
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
Automatic

755
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
Fan

756
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,744
Question exactly

757
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,304
Because it's a dehumidifier only

758
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
Then you're still

759
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
Kind of stuck with that

760
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:02,496
Right but it is simple and that does not require any Hub everything

761
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
It just requires two

762
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
Basic dehumidifier and

763
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
Ace Mart

764
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Outlet

765
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:14,016
Right and if you went with the other option of a switching humidity sensor

766
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296
You're looking at a property

767
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,856
And I'm thinking you're going to need a hug because of the sensor

768
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,160
Oh yeah you will need a

769
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,696
You're really looking like two hundred bucks

770
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,256
What's plus an install plus you've actually got to put the fan on

771
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
None of that

772
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,864
Options

773
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,192
There's some options depending on what you think you want and need

774
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,216
And can

775
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,752
A four-door reasonably

776
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,032
Expect to do

777
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,824
As you can see Kevin

778
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,104
Afforded something

779
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:44,224
I just haven't got around to it it's been 3 years Mike my deal is

780
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
It's not that I'm five years that's

781
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,296
Then you sell it at a garage sale

782
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Exactly

783
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,392
That's a way to yours brand you can just buy my phone

784
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
There you go

785
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:56,512
Okay well this is great thanks Kevin for helping me out with the news I would

786
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,816
Encourage everyone to stay tuned

787
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,888
For Adam Smith of light point Who's going to be talking about the

788
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,680
Brand New fira Consortium

789
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,960
How is secure

790
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,496
How does location

791
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
And

792
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:13,664
How other companies can assess what makes a good Wireless technology like how they know where they should be

793
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
Investing

794
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,712
It's going to be fun

795
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:19,808
Staging for that but first a message from our sponsor

796
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,648
Hey everyone we're taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast

797
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:30,048
Message from our sponsor sponsor is nutanix and I have such a Bugatti

798
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
Botanics here

799
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
What to talk about

800
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,888
Hi Sachin how are you doing

801
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,192
Hi Stacy I'm good thanks for having me on

802
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:41,056
So such an eye associate nutanix with Hyper converged infrastructure

803
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,384
What is it specifically that you guys offer in The Internet of Things

804
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
It is called

805
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
Vallarta

806
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,136
That allows users to

807
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,696
Modernity application

808
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,000
Flextime manager

809
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:03,328
Literally Atlantic Scale from a central point of control

810
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
And last but not least

811
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:10,240
It enables users to do data processing across the aisle in the clock for ideas

812
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,312
Excellent so what is nutanix is

813
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
Core mission

814
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
In the iot

815
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,408
They say it's about getting

816
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:23,808
Insights out of raw data as soon as possible

817
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,624
600 billion terabytes of information next year

818
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:30,464
This is compared to 15 billion

819
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:34,048
That's kind of excited in all the public and private clubs combined

820
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:38,400
Cesar Perez possible

821
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,984
And very close to other states created end of year ideas

822
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
All right

823
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,080
There's a lot of data

824
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,688
You got to deal with it if so can you walk us through a customer story to illustrate the sconce

825
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,528
Smart cities customer and

826
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,880
Thinking about applying new type of cameras

827
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,952
License plate recognition cameras and AI cameras

828
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,280
To figure out traffic violation Center track cars and son

829
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
And

830
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,704
American listen to use their existing cameras and all that they that they were already collecting

831
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:20,640
Go get all those insights anyway

832
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,992
Ki Base traffic management project

833
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:29,088
Apply new devices for it

834
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,624
18 months

835
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
From start to finish

836
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,536
Lifeline software

837
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,888
That sounds very cool so if I wanted to use my existing data and device

838
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,752
To discover insights where could I go to find out more about natanic

839
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,080
Call Tyrone

840
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,104
Flashlight

841
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,896

Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

844
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,024
Today's guest is Adam Smith

845
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,584
Who is director of marketing at

846
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
Hi I don't know how are you

847
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,448
Tight 18 doing great how are you doing

848
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:20,544
Excellent

849
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Testing for

850
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,384
And you guys have tested all kinds of dip

851
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,224
Standards and you recently joined the fear of Consortium

852
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,528
And I shouldn't say you I should say your

853
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,088
So before we get into

854
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,624
Ciara let's talk about

855
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,184
Why you guys join the alliance

856
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
Your

857
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
Business case for doing sex

858
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:46,656
Yes so we recently joined be up here at the Consortium there are relatively new organization and we are a

859
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,448
Entirely Wireless

860
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,032
And I'd like to say that if there's like a product out there

861
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,104
Consumer Industrial

862
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,384
In some capacity

863
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,944
What we look to do is we look to help companies

864
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,224
Bring devices to Market

865
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,016
In the rectum into the manufacturer

866
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,808
Industrial

867
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,880
Actually

868
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:11,232
Put some structure and organization around a new technology

869
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:19,680
As the 15.4 IEEE

870
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,520
Here is doing is putting together an ecosystem

871
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,336
Bringing multiple players together to help bring

872
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,896
Some structure and organization and

873
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,688
Certified products

874
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,736
To make sure that they operate with each other

875
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:33,760
Okay

876
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,832
So this is important obviously to you guys because this is

877
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
Businesses

878
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,696
How many standards organizations do the guys

879
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,048
What part of a few organizations that lot of would like

880
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,096
Businesses has been historically in Wi-Fi

881
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:54,496
Remember the Wi-Fi Alliance today and we are currently bringing Wi-Fi six Market as part of

882
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,824
We're not going to talk about that

883
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,616
We are going to go back to Sarah

884
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,176
The fear Consortium was started

885
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,480
Bear recently by nxp

886
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,504
Assa abloy

887
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:09,088
And Samsung and one of the things that it's

888
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,648
Same as provide

889
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,184
Ranging

890
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
Location

891
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
What does that mean

892
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,560
This is one of the reasons why we're excited about this

893
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:24,960
Historically when we think about Wireless technology

894
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
And this is a little different

895
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:31,872
So this is not so much about how do I get gigabytes of data through the air this is more about how do I

896
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:35,456
Precisely position to devices relative to each other

897
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,016
And so it's about knowing

898
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:38,784
Bachelorette

899
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
Positioning

900
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,600
If you will so it's not so much about

901
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:46,208
We got megabits to gigabits per second going through the air it's more about I can very accurately

902
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,840
Of two devices that are that are talking to

903
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,168
That's what it's opened up some really interesting use cases

904
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:00,544
List of existing Technologies

905
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
In products moving forward

906
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:06,944
All right so I'm going to quibble with you just a little bit because I feel

907
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,760
In the industrial iot in Enterprise iot

908
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,552
Location is a big deal

909
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,856
And I see all kinds of wirelessly

910
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
Location app

911
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
Tell me the most popular game

912
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
Bluetooth

913
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,000
How is fira maybe better than blue shoes

914
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
For Enterprise

915
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,448
I'm thinking the same thing as multiple Technologies I need Wi-Fi

916
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,520
Bluetooth

917
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:36,128
5.1 is looking to enhance the capability

918
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,176
And then client conversation that goes on their phone

919
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
Different

920
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,160
Personals very very very white

921
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,464
So it's it's about 5

922
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,816
You can cut up the Bluetooth which is only

923
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:59,680
You have some more precise you can be with position answer what people are looking to achieve with ultra-wideband is

924
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,616
That is super impressive accuracy

925
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,688
It makes a lot of sense and the fact that it's

926
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
It comes out

927
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,248
Pulses as opposed to greetings

928
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
Between

929
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,832
Radios is definitely going to help with power

930
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,512
Secure access

931
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,560
I'm assuming this is why I said blaze

932
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,376
Right now I might walk by my

933
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:34,496
Connected door locks and it'll open with Bluetooth

934
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,824
Consumer applications but also things like

935
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,176
Yes definitely have heard of this technology being used in the context

936
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,040
Buildings

937
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:52,928
With the precise positioning you can't be a person that's not trying to do good that's sitting next to the car and

938
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,000
That basically do what's called relay hack where you be rebroadcast

939
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
Unique about

940
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,608
Why is this concept

941
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:07,264
Just because you're free broadcasting a signal in the other radio receives it you need to also messed that up with the value of the season

942
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,848
So it knows that you're not spoofing

943
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:16,992
You physically right there at the door of the car it's not somebody hiding over in the bushes after you leave Andre broadcasting the signal

944
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,784
So then the question becomes

945
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,344
You're experienced in the world

946
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
Wireless

947
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:25,952
How do we determine if something like this is going to be a success

948
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:32,352
I feel like Wireless standards pop up all the time and some of them are amazing and some of them just going to die a slow death

949
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
Whichever

950
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:41,056
A great migration is so many different times I mean

951
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,360
I've been Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

952
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,176
And some of this is a little bit of

953
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:50,784
The technology was waiting for an application in the application just hit a really sweet spot

954
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:54,368
Minnesota's the smartphone came out pretty much Wi-Fi Bluetooth

955
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,696
Just had cemented a place in history

956
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,744
Looking forward of backwards compatibility

957
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,144
But what does it take for a new technology to get adoption cuz we're seeing all kinds of industrial iot technology

958
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,448
It's kind of like

959
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,520
No one tool is the best one out there they're all just

960
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,056
Different tools in the toolbox

961
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:17,152
And depending on the millions of applications in the industrial space

962
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,688
One might be better than the other

963
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,736
Ultra wideband

964
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:27,136
A particular you'll have some interesting advantages

965
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
Nice about it is that

966
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,976
It can operate in

967
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
Spectrum

968
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,816
But it's operating under the FCC part 15 limit

969
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,608
So it's allowed

970
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,640
Because it is very wide bandwidth

971
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,432
Very low power

972
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,248
Call me when you can notice it

973
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:57,344
And it because it's white van with its it's not very susceptible to near Bandon or

974
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,440
You're not going to jam the signal

975
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,720
500 + 9

976
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,816
Listen interesting things about the physical layer part of

977
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,864
The technology

978
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
The thing that were excited about it

979
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,448
Thumbs up this new use cases

980
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,520
Actually I almost

981
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,056
To The Internet of Things

982
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,384
Because you can precisely know where something is

983
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,944
Sensors can touch and feel and see relative

984
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,880
You're also not looking to displace Wi-Fi or Bluetooth

985
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:37,536
It's looking there to enhance the use cases that can be done to products so there's this

986
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,072
High point of view because

987
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,656
Interesting

988
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:49,056
You don't have to worry about some of these other things with historically worried about that intercepting signals

989
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,943
Okay that is a lot so let's break that down a little bit

990
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711
So

991
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:59,551
I'm going to use a fancy word that I hate trying to stay up Podcast but I'm going to go for

992
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,135
With this idea of nerve endings you're basically giving things

993
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,671
Proprioception

994
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,231
Which is the sense of where you are in space

995
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:14,911
You can do with that but I'd be curious to see if you have ideas about taking that forward what that means

996
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,471
It was a Enterprise in industrial custom

997
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,287
To be honest this is one of these things where

998
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:24,895
It's a new technology

999
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,943
But I can certainly Envision things

1000
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,319
Maybe a medical industrial application where you're wearing some sort of identification

1001
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,111
Batch that have the technology in it

1002
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,695
And there's some sensor on a door and senses that you're walking towards it

1003
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,463
And

1004
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,279
You're authenticated to go in that door so it open

1005
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,815
Your colleagues

1006
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:46,399
Walking around the corner has their own badge and they're not

1007
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:52,799
It's somewhat of a new way of thinking about

1008
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,335
Building access

1009
00:42:54,591 --> 00:43:00,735
Security access in the automotive space that this is being discussed in in multiple ways I mean

1010
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:06,879
People talking about

1011
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,927
Know your wallet

1012
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
If your car keys

1013
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,255
Interesting use cases out there that I think

1014
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,047
Interesting

1015
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,583
See what happens with the forward

1016
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
No broccoli

1017
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,935
As a person who is seeing many Wireless standards

1018
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,215
Let's talk about

1019
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,287
Success in the consumer realm vs the Enterprise

1020
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,847
Because the consumer realm it feels like

1021
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,151
That is everyone's Holy Grail but I could be wrong

1022
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,943
What does it mean

1023
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,783
If your pushing a wireless standard for Consumer versus Inter

1024
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,575
Success what are those look like

1025
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,855
What are the impacts on the cup

1026
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,439
If we're talking about specifically around the iot

1027
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:45,023
In the consumer space frankly what you wanted to put your product to be adopted

1028
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,815
And so what you're going to want to take your time

1029
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,839
The technology that is

1030
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,375
Has a high rate of adoption

1031
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,447
Any type of product

1032
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,775
It's going to have

1033
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,711
Wi-Fi as well

1034
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:08,319
You're not going to have to force your way into the ecosystem

1035
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
That makes sense

1036
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,135
And in the Enterprise

1037
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:15,487
It feels like there's already so many Technologies and they're very purpose-built

1038
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,047
So maybe this will be fine there and

1039
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
What does success look like

1040
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,911
The Enterprise is a wild animal

1041
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:26,495
Wireless technology

1042
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,287
So if I look at for example

1043
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,127
Why don't we just take these well adopted consumer Technologies and put them in the industrial space

1044
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,687
What are the challenges are

1045
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,039
So Wi-Fi to me is this elegant

1046
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,879
Technology that was really designed to be super robust in the fact that

1047
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:48,767
Descended from an industrial and Enterprise

1048
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,351
The pragmatic Pro

1049
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:02,335
Networks that you don't know

1050
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:06,175
Spectrum so if you set up a private Network where nobody else can be on there

1051
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:10,783
Christine

1052
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,087
Okay as someone who evaluates

1053
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,415
What do you look for when trying to figure out which Wireless

1054
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,303
I might answer this in two different ways because in a way point is

1055
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,327
Agnostic

1056
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:27,935
To the wireless technology

1057
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:33,823
And we're not there to make judgment

1058
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,383
That being said certainly we need to choose

1059
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,199
Where we spend our investment dollars onto which technology

1060
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,479
And so when we are

1061
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,503
Evaluating

1062
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,575
Where should we put our dollars

1063
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,111
We have to make some judgments

1064
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,071
Different Wireless personalities on

1065
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,631
We design a flexible platform

1066
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,167
Can be programmed to be a differ

1067
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:06,591
I hate the term software-defined radio but if you will

1068
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,127
We are at the end of the day

1069
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,967
Then from a software development point of view clearly we prioritize based on where we think

1070
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:16,575
Receive momentum that we will check our checks and we check our checks in our checks

1071
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:25,535
And that's the beginning of this will work with some Consortium

1072
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,863
Got it and I like this idea of Wireless personnel

1073
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,167
I'm trying to sit here and efficiently

1074
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,191
2 personalities

1075
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,775
Given your view with the market

1076
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:39,359
What are you excited about for The Internet of Things specifically

1077
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
Coming up

1078
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
What is the next big Tech

1079
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,687
Technology

1080
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:50,879
I don't want to focus so much on what's the next big technology because there's always

1081
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,415
The wireless Market in two different sites

1082
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,207
Spectrum Technologies

1083
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,983
Most recently things like sigfox Lora and in the

1084
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
Industrial

1085
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,199
They tend to be governed by not only

1086
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,271
From the government

1087
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:22,879
They're also typically working with standard bodies that move on a slower

1088
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:29,535
Did it pretty quickly

1089
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,583
In the volume

1090
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,887
It's one thing to say

1091
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
Consumer space

1092
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:38,751
7 billion people the planet of everybody's hands

1093
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,823
Ciot just kind of exponentially growing

1094
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,895
For me as a marketer

1095
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:48,223
What we try to look for our high-value at Coyote

1096
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,759
Devices so we're looking for things

1097
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,831
It does matter where

1098
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:56,159
Security or safety quality

1099
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,463
That's where we tend to focus on the industrial space

1100
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
Okay so

1101
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,559
That doesn't answer the question of what you're excited about

1102
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,375
I'm always excited

1103
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,399
To be constantly

1104
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:11,775
So as we move into the 5G World here I think 5G

1105
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:16,895
Akira but 5G working with multiple different Technologies is going to be a pretty cool thing

1106
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:24,319
But some of the things that people are looking at with private Networks

1107
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:30,207
Is opening up some new business cases that we have

1108
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:35,839
Okay I agree with you I look at like 5G plus like the cbrs band radio

1109
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:39,679
Spectrum auction that were thinking about how to do something like that and like oh my gosh

1110
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,727
I can have my own corporate Network

1111
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
What is that mean

1112
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:48,127
In my career I've never seen so much Spectrum activity as we've seen it the last two years it's just

1113
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,919
Wild how much Spectrum

1114
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,199
Motion is going on

1115
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:57,855
Some of the

1116
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:04,255
Unlicensed bands in SEC should be hopefully

1117
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,327
Adopting either later this year into the middle of next

1118
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:13,215
I just opened up new Spectrum where devices can operate more networks and makes the world go round

1119
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:18,847
And we'll see hopefully

1120
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,127
Wireless radios

1121
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,407
