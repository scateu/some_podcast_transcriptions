Put sensors on cars to test air pollution and

23
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:07,840
Man this is great iot use case we're going to talk about all kinds of challenges she faced

24
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
First

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
Let's kick off the show with a

26
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,960
Message from another one of this week's sponsors

Writing business with a 100 million dollar exit that's Affiliated. Com

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,712
Coyote

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,296
All right, let's kick it off with

36
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,832
New WiFi products

37
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
Because we love the Wi-Fi

38
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
Gyro

39
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
Which I have Eero

40
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
Routers at

41
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
My house

42
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
Where are you going to the wife I still

43
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:16,192
I am still tired I detest the Arizona was very very happy with

44
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,080
New products be two of the Eero routers don't worry dies

45
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
Your V ones are still cool

46
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,968
So what did Johnny say John 3 things that change the form factor

47
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,272
Did adding a radio protocol and

48
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,088
Get out of services so let's break that down

49
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
New form factor what they've done

50
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
They've taken a

51
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,488
Normal Euro

52
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,280
The square with rounded edges

53
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
That's going to be the

54
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,448
Primary hero that plugs into your router and has two ethernet ports that you can use for switches and all that other good stuff

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
And that caused what is that cost 7

56
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,800
The original gyro

57
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
At no

58
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,664
Actually the original arrows were three for $500 for 99

59
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,712
And then I went down I think by 100.

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
Nosey

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
The new version

62
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:09,440
I will the new version is I-10 and 10 Beacon which American talk about is

63
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
$299

64
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
90

65
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,816
Pekin is confusing

66
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
Beacons Ark

67
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,168
Completely new form factor for them

68
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:24,288
And they plug into the wall so they kind of remind me of the plume Wi-Fi pods

69
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
So think of this is a WiFi pod

70
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:30,688
It also happens to double as a nightlight so it might be something nice you put in your hallway

71
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
Forget Wi-Fi in

72
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
Hallway spaces

73
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,064
I got half the size of the original gyro

74
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Yeah

75
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
And so

76
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,256
That's the idea is you will by the mainiero and then for many people just plugging in a couple Bekins around their house

77
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Cows are going to be sufficient

78
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,632
This one factor is is it's good I can see how this would work

79
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
Free People

80
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
I would be sticking with my

81
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
Eero

82
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
Crow zero normal zero with ethernet

83
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
Sims 3 full-sized Euros are 499

84
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
Got it

85
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
Okay so

86
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,040
That is State that's back to that

87
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,392
And ideas 1 0 and 1 begin

88
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,464
For 299 is going to cover a 1/2 to bed

89
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,327
A two to three bedroom home you're going to want to add another Beacon

90
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
Play with that a little bit

91
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
And the pro

92
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
The three

93
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
Euro Pros

94
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,519
That's like a five to six bedroom

95
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,311
So that's one of those massive

96
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,359
Massive houses like we haven't

97
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
So I'm liking this

98
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,479
I think what I'm going to do with my setup

99
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,295
Because I have wired Lan and I have a lot of sweets

100
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
I keep my exist

101
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
But I might

102
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
Actually you know

103
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
Spring for an extra Peak energy

104
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:50,047
Brights right and in my case I do not have wire

105
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,399
Ethernet throughout the house so I have to go with a wireless solution so

106
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
I would if it were me

107
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,263
I'm take a look at the I-10 and

108
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:03,359
One or two because I got to figure that out based on homes us make sense

109
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
Yasso

110
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
This

111
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
I don't know what this feels

112
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
Pretty good for them

113
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
The other bits though

114
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
I think really excite

115
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
They've added

116
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Thread

117
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Capability

118
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
To there

119
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
And I know many of you guys are going to be like

120
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
What

121
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
That's still around

122
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,167
So thread is a low-power wireless protocol

123
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,471
That was developed by nest

124
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
Samsung

125
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
Couple other companies

126
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
And it's

127
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,127
It's basically a replacement or more modern

128
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
Replacement for zigbee and Z-Wave

129
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
So think about it's a mesh Network

130
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,551
Talks directly to the Internet so it support IPv6

131
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
And

132
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
For the longest time

133
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
Most people have been like I'm not all

134
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,999
I'm not that excited about the red most people are not into the red

135
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
I was one of those people

136
00:05:54,047 --> 00:06:00,191
So yeah I just talked about manufacturer so I asked Nick Weaver the CEO of Iran like

137
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
A threat he's like well

138
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,543
It's a great protocol and he thinks that

139
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:09,407
One of the reasons manufacturers aren't into it is because there's nothing to act as a

140
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
Hub for it so there's nothing to support

141
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,551
Unless you've got Nest products in your house you don't have

142
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
The thread Network that

143
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
You need like for my Mashburn

144
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
So

145
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,231
It's going to act as a thread border router

146
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
End

147
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,303
That will be exciting if

148
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Stats

149
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,703
I don't think it's a Bad Bet and I'm trying to think

150
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,775
Are there any other routers right now that have

151
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
Thread support

152
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,663
Google why is my yeah I think it I think it might

153
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,455
I have to check out to be sure but

154
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,015
That's the only one I can think of you know and that's

155
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,671
It without the support the network support the vertical support you're not going to have products that work with it so sleepy I start somewhere so

156
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Kudos to you

157
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Chicken and egg

158
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
Barrister providing

159
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
Snow the chicken

160
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
Is the router the egg or the chicken

161
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,239
All right and then the final thing for this news is Eero is adding services

162
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
So

163
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,847
Then creating basically a $10 a month service

164
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
And you get applications over the net

165
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,711
Work the first two they're launching

166
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,759
Is security so network security

167
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Through the network

168
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
And then the

169
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,855
Other one is Parental Control

170
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
Drools like more

171
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,463
Right now you have the ability to like pause devices

172
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
On your Eros

173
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
And you don't set like

174
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,095
My kids stuff can't go online at this place in

175
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
If you don't let you do things like

176
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Summer editor's let you

177
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
Play whitelist sites

178
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,799
But as a parent I'm excited because they have things like

179
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,639
I can enable Google safe search for all devices associated

180
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
My daughter

181
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
And she actually can't change that

182
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
So

183
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
Is Edison Pointe timeout

184
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,807
Get smarter

185
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
They just Google for the answer to figure out how to get around the Google

186
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,047
That is part of this service as well so I'm excited to see the

187
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
I'm in the security stuff

188
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
It's actually very similar to what

189
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,495
The Almond router offers the Almond router from securifi has similar security

190
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
Features I don't believe they charge for them

191
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
Well and normally

192
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
I'm not a fan of

193
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,199
Paying for monthly services with smart home taipei

194
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
Things and

195
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
But not but

196
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
In this case I probably would make an exception

197
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Because

198
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,647
What we talked about all the time or the challenges at IRT and smartphones and such

199
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
Is the security

200
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,999
So if this can help protect against

201
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:38,143
And I are going to have a lot of malicious website or s or some other exploit I'm all for it

202
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,495
You know and that's the promise I mean that the promises he will understand like

203
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Hey

204
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,335
Should your nest thermostat really be talking to China

205
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Herbert

206
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,175
And so that's the exciting part

207
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,759
Again I would pay I honestly would Pages for

208
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,807
Trolls because my daughter is a little

209
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Younger than your kid

210
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,415
It's and curious to see

211
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:06,559
A security research firm really take a look at that's only because the promise is is pretty big men

212
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:11,679
Euro says that it's got built-in protections as a database of threats and that database

213
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,263
Has millions of malicious websites and net

214
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,079
It's updated every second so there's a lot of

215
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Cloud stuff going on there

216
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
And it sounds very promising

217
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
But but seeing practice

218
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
That's the news

219
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
It's pretty big update

220
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,135
Very exciting will get the new routers

221
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,463
Here to test and we'll hear more about those win

222
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
When the time comes

223
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
So

224
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
Also

225
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
In Wi-Fi

226
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,447
The Wi-Fi Alliance is doing a home design Serta

227
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
Patient and I

228
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
I mean I think that's a great idea

229
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Work so

230
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Kevin you want to tell him what

231
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:59,039
Well to this is a really not force a consumer this is for home builders

232
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,623
Desertification project if you're going to build a house 2

233
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,231
You integrate Wi-Fi networks in the in the design of your home construction

234
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
So

235
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,327
They're going to suggest where you put access points and so on and so forth

236
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
I'm wondering how many

237
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Builders

238
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
Will use this

239
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,031
What the cost benefit is to running you know either net and so on so forth.

240
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
Granted it's expensive to run

241
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,383
Cabling so there's got to be a cost-savings there

242
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
I don't know because

243
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,991
So we built our house in 2012

244
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,319
And we ran cable and ethernet

245
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Every room

246
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
End

247
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
I'm so glad we did

248
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Because

249
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Almighty

250
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
And

251
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,495
It'd be really interesting like as acedia contractor you know like you could come in and have someone outfit your house for like

252
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
Smart home and

253
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Retroact

254
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,871
What if we do this but like in the design phase

255
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,711
I don't know if I really buy into saying Go Wireless over

256
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Wired

257
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
Right right

258
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,623
It's a tough decision because you know what is it you don't know what your home buyers

259
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,487
Needs will be in terms of services that are they going to do you know 4K video streaming on

260
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
And every bedroom

261
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
You just don't know

262
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
So

263
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
It's an interesting concept

264
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,215
I'm just not sure about the practicality of it yet

265
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,823
And maybe it's too far ahead of its time cuz I remember we had Scott Jensen who actually

266
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,639
He's a design dude he actually works at Google but

267
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:35,551
He came on to talk about like design considerations and Construction in one of the things he mentioned was as Wireless

268
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Technology gets better

269
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135
It becomes really

270
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
Telling to not have to like

271
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,255
4 light switches you wouldn't have a light switch you just have

272
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Bluetooth switch

273
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
But

274
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
So you would eliminate the need for like

275
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
Wiring in huge parts of

276
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
The home

277
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
This is kind of that same idea and that's

278
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:03,199
That is a cost-savings especially when you talk about copper wiring when you're talking about like Cat6 cable

279
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Alyssa

280
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:09,343
Rite Aid cost savings but now I'm trying to think of it from a homebuyer perspective

281
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
If

282
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,975
Your cell phone is Houston say what we've gone through the Wi-Fi Alliance Home Design products so

283
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
We can tell you where the best

284
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Places to put

285
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
Your router isn't over

286
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
I don't know if somebody really cares about that

287
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,215
Enough they made this a worldwide rather have

288
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,519
Wired how much does that cost you know

289
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,943
And then if they're smart enough to know they need a wire there probably smart enough to figure out where the best place to buy routers and someone anyway

290
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
Pro Wireless Tampa

291
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Well in so weird

292
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
We're probably thinking

293
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,855
We're overthinking this we probably what's going to happen is

294
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,207
Again it's going to fade in the background and consumers will just have their Wi-Fi stuff

295
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,303
Right I think it was going to happen

296
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,911
All of your connected devices that wireless doorbell that you want that's going to work

297
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
So maybe it's a waiter like

298
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,799
But it's not really selling point maybe it's just the way to reduce

299
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
And cost

300
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
And

301
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
You guys can say hello to my neighbor

302
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Pradaxa

303
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
Haven't having a field day today

304
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
All right so that's

305
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,647
So let's talk about services

306
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
Last week Kevin and I talked about

307
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
Opening his door

308
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Through his Google

309
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Home

310
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
Amazon figure out

311
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
How to do that

312
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,167
What you can't eat meat

313
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
But Scott Jones

314
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
Sent us an email he was like guys

315
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
It was actually

316
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,271
But he's right he's right we are

317
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
I did this with the echo because that's

318
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,927
That happens to be downstairs in my house and I know Kevin is an echo dude

319
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
So I set up

320
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
The way you're going to do this

321
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,863
To natively lock or unlock your doors have to be to separate commands

322
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
Is I went into wink

323
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,703
And I created a shortcut

324
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
It was called

325
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
Lock garage door

326
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
So I went into it

327
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,383
After setting the shortcut and I

328
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,479
Tied it to my Amazon Echo and then I said

329
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
I gave it

330
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Command so

331
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
Ended

332
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
Precursor to any commands

333
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,903
Giver is Madame a trigger

334
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
And then whatever were you like

335
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
So

336
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
I did garage

337
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Oh I know I did

338
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
Trigger

339
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,887
Lock garage

340
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
So

341
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
I probably should have

342
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Extra lock

343
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
And you said that up and then you

344
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
Say if

345
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,639
Madame a trigger and then you go to then

346
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
You go to the wink

347
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,271
And then it's going to say shortcuts and it's going to give you a list of your shortcuts you pick the

348
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Block version

349
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
And then

350
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,159
When I ran the command my latency was about admit it

351
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,231
It wasn't very long at all so

352
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
I really

353
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,303
Sutherlands great now you are good at to set up a separate

354
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
For unlocking it

355
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
And you mean

356
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
Try to get your Echo

357
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,823
Yeah shame on us for forgetting about half

358
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Is Sia

359
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
That that's

360
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Yeah I did I fell

361
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
I felt really

362
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,735
Will it away I mean that's

363
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:21,599
It's telling that the native services are getting better on these devices that you don't need

364
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,951
Some kind of backend Cloud Plumbing like afternoon in a lot of cases but

365
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,815
It is a great service and we shouldn't we should have overlooked it so it's kind of I kind of do feel silly as well

366
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,631
And this works because the wink

367
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,679
Actually can see the lock

368
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,239
And in my case the home

369
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
Can see the wing

370
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
But I can't see the lock on the way

371
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
See everything else on the way

372
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Wake so

373
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
So this is a way to get around that

374
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
Yay and

375
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,783
We also noticed that in the Wink app

376
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
Should you want to

377
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,623
And Kevin says this has been around for a while

378
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
I

379
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
I have my Christmas lights

380
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:03,839
Do things on the Winker cuz I have to spread my Gloria my Gloria cross many hubs

381
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
I got it all

382
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:10,239
So he was like oh my God they have this and he's like

383
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,055
But I didn't tell you that in case you didn't know

384
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,127
You can set a mode change on link and have it work

385
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
Through

386
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Google

387
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Home

388
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,527
So you can have vacation mode and you can set a Cascade of events to happen

389
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,087
Turn off devices connected to your

390
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
And it will happen

391
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
When you say

392
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
I won't say the words but hey G

393
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,743
Is it telwink

394
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,279
Or is it just

395
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Vacation mode

396
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,863
I mode

397
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
So

398
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Haiti

399
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
Vacation mode

400
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
And

401
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
Gualala

402
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
It happens

403
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,847
Yeah this is this is been a beta for voice actions

404
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
With Google in wink

405
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,991
For a while and it actually now makes sense that they have shortcuts in Google

406
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,063
Which we talked about it to Mid to shows like

407
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,647
I wonder if the beta set information into that actual and finished product

408
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
So I actually try to shortcuts

409
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,023
I tried the Logitech Harmony volume up volume down shortcut

410
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
So far that is not working

411
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,143
So I am still troubleshooting that because I really wanted

412
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,471
At some point in time I'm going to figure it out you guys and then I'll come back to you

413
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Say this is

414
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
Or

415
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
One of you astute listeners

416
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Who's

417
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
Way better and things of things like if

418
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,687
Y'all can tell me how you did it because

419
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
Nothing I say

420
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,295
Why were talking services in wink

421
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,855
On the last episode we mention that

422
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,647
Wink added services

423
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:35,743
Two of them home sitter and Moonlight and I didn't try home sitter because

424
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,351
I work from home so I don't want the lights going on and off at various times to make it look like I'm home

425
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
Cuz I'm already home

426
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
Yes yes

427
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,543
But I'm home at 9

428
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:53,151
I can just see the girls downstairs watching TV hey the lights just went out

429
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
Make it look like we're not home

430
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,479
Moonlight I did use Moonlight witch

431
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:01,855
I actually used a manual version of this by setting up schedules and pack

432
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,927
I'm going to correct myself because in the last time I said they were robots

433
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,767
They were not realize they were schedules in the Wind Gap see so confusing

434
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,351
And that's the whole point of moonlight is to make it not confusing

435
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
Two brand-new

436
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
Wink Hub owners

437
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
So what Winky

438
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,495
Add was the Moonlight service which

439
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,055
Ask your lights turn on when it gets dark outside

440
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,407
And I was already doing that in the schedules are they said but in Moonlight I set it up

441
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,759
It's pretty simple to nice clean interface you pick which lights you want to go on

442
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
Are you

443
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:37,439
And put the location which basically it uses GPS to determine your home location to make sure I can sync up with when's sunset

444
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
When Sunset is

445
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
At your home

446
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:45,375
And then you choose timing and this is what it kind of fell down a little bit for me but I understand why

447
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:51,007
When do you want to turn your lights on and on and off is what it says and give you three options

448
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
Sunset to midnight

449
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
Sunset to 2 a.m.

450
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
Sunset to Sunrise

451
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,783
I had scheduled for like Sunset to like 10 or 11 p.m. you can't change the times in here you get three

452
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Hard-code

453
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
Credit choices

454
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,415
I get the concept it's to make it simple and useful

455
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,791
I guess I would like to see a little spinner option to change

456
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
The time regardless of that

457
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
I set it up

458
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,423
Saved it turn it on and Moonlight is working perfectly fine

459
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,471
If I fits overriding my schedule

460
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:26,591
To my lights didn't go off at like 10:11 or 11 even though the schedule is still active

461
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127
So if you have a schedule

462
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,455
I think moonlights can override that so

463
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,759
Those are pretty much the devices in

464
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,039
Stuff we tried this

465
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
Actually no I tried the WeMo dimmer

466
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,623
I tried installed it

467
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:45,279
Before last show and I didn't get a chance to test out some of the stuff but now that I've lived with it for a little bit longer

468
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,863
Wi-Fi dimmer switch for $80

469
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
Okay here's some cool features they've got

470
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Nighttime

471
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
Tricep nighttime tula

472
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
20%

473
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
I think it's at by default

474
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,079
And the 20% means that between

475
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,407
The default setting is like 11 and 6 a.m.

476
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,455
When you hit the light switch in your room

477
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
Are you down

478
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,295
It's turn on it turns on at only 20%

479
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,343
Which is super nice in that just happen automatically

480
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
Automatic

481
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
Nice

482
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,927
The other thing it does

483
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,511
Pretty cool is it calibrates two different LEDs and so actually

484
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
Started with different LEDs in there

485
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
And what time is it

486
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,679
The calibration process has you turn it to its lowest setting

487
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,983
And then it has you run up and down the dimmer

488
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,799
To see if it flickers and if it flickers it tries again

489
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
So

490
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,663
That was actually really cool because flicker is annoying as all get-out

491
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,527
And how many years as well but I told others

492
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,575
I couldn't hear him from either the alley

493
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,903
Daiso

494
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
And

495
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,487
It appears that when you turn it on and off

496
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,303
It goes to the last remembered setting

497
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,911
So if you didn't have them 200% you turn the lights on it's going to go to whatever you like

498
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Last Hyderabad

499
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
What you like or not

500
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,775
Things that are little counterintuitive

501
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
AR

502
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
There's a Dipper thing on it

503
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
That touch sensitive dimmer

504
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,663
Chocolate Groove

505
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,991
You would think that you could

506
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:14,111
Move your hand on it and turn it on but you can't you have to click it and then move up the

507
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,672
So it's only for the light

508
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,232
Outputs not for light on light off

509
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
Yes

510
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,560
And then the other thing is they have a long

511
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:28,448
Press option that was really excited about so you can actually control other we nose and in my bedroom

512
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728
Which is where these are

513
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,776
Are the WeMo dimmer controller for camp

514
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
And then I have

515
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,896
A WeMo Insight switch that controls my husband's beds

516
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
Side table lamp

517
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Hey

518
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,760
Worcester long press and turn everything

519
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,040
That would be awesome

520
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,368
And I told it to do that like

521
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,904
8 different times in

522
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
It never ever work

523
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
So the laundress

524
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
I don't know what's going

525
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
But it's not working

526
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
But it sounds very prompt

527
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,424
Yeah I mean they're both Wi-Fi devices I can assume and I can fit into each other

528
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,752
Yeah WeMo in the app conceive

529
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,032
It's very simple you're like

530
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,080
It's like settling press you press that

531
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
A toast to the thing where it's like

532
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,968
You can toggle something you can turn it on you can turn it off and I feel like you do

533
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Another thing

534
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
So I just said turn off

535
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,392
And then it gives you all the WeMo devices it's found so in my house there

536
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,184
So I can

537
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
Dimmer and

538
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
Bedside table lamp

539
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,328
It's safe and when I hit save it was like

540
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,376
The screen just got a flash but I didn't

541
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
Forget the lag time

542
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Strange

543
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
So we know

544
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,736
Alright news

545
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,528
There is some news

546
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,880
From the week before that we can get to in last week's podcast the biggest

547
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,184
AWS Greengrass

548
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
Y'all are like what

549
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,792
So this is for the Enterprise crew

550
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,400
What happened is Amazon has Amazon web services which is AWS

551
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,960
Huge business for them cloud

552
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
But

553
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,800
Green grass actually it brings

554
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,848
Iot to the edge

555
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
So

556
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:16,736
What you do is you can run AWS Greengrass core on an edge device

557
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,552
It will allow a lot of things to happen

558
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,856
And it talks to AWS Lambda serve

559
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,952
So some of the things that lets you do is it's going to help me in a state

560
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,256
On devices even when there's no internet connected

561
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
It helps

562
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,584
Communicate between

563
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,888
Other devices that talk to

564
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,216
The Gateway device so if you have

565
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,288
AWS iot SDK on

566
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
Vice

567
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,128
Those devices were all talk to AWS

568
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
Green grass running

569
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
Devices

570
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Even if there's no

571
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
Haven't did that make sense to you

572
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
I felt like I was

573
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
Using a lot of

574
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,928
Words that didn't make sense to a lot of normal teeth

575
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
SO2 translate to normal

576
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
What this does is this pools

577
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,328
Amazon web services away from the cloud

578
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,608
Put on

579
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
A Gateway device

580
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:10,240
It extends Amazon's Cloud capabilities to the industrial

581
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
Because those guys

582
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,664
If tons of data a lot of it needs to happen without any latency so think about a blade

583
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,248
In a manufacturing plant that you know is chopping chickens to bits in

584
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,832
You know if it senses a finger in the way it's got to stop

585
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,440
So this is a really big Market

586
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
4

587
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,512
Everyone Microsoft has introduced

588
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,816
Azure at the iot

589
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,120
Azure at the iot edge does the same thing

590
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,424
Kind of links the cloud to the Gateway

591
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,472
Going to see a lot more this

592
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,288
And if you want to know more about 8

593
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:48,384
Green grass I did do a whole Amazon

594
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,432
Industry in the newsletter so

595
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,456
You could have Stacey on iot

596
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,040
Shameless plug for me

597
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,832
The other big news

598
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
Roblox

599
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,440
So we will talk about robots that much

600
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
Know what is that

601
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,280
There's a mean there's only so many cool things have

602
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
What is pretty

603
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,680
Sometimes they're scary

604
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:15,264
And I think that has a lot to do with what we're going to talk about next to be honest

605
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,080
This would be a good place for a nap

606
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
It's so scary

607
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,176
Tuscany

608
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,784
Yasso remember back in 2013 Google bought

609
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Boston Dynamics

610
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,088
Text which makes those

611
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,136
Bipedal quad

612
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
People

613
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
Robots that

614
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,560
You can't take them over they look like when was like mechanical deer or Buffalo and they look like demons

615
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,680
See that there's the scary.

616
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
Giant

617
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,496
Loping

618
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,032
Jibon looking thing

619
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,640
That is really cool but scary as all get-out and they recently made a

620
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
Bipedal

621
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,224
Jump over stuff

622
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,040
Just scaring

623
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,344
It's so scary

624
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,744
Anyway there's been a lot of ammunition covered like you said these videos and a lot of people walking away

625
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Terry and

626
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,816
I don't know the Google is happy with that but

627
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,864
It also made me the fact that

628
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,912
I don't know that they found a way to make money

629
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
From it

630
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
So

631
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:23,360
I think about a year ago it was rumored that they were looking to sell Boston Dynamics I think Toyota was actually in the mix for that

632
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,688
But regardless tire is not in the mix now because SoftBank

633
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,224
Has bought

634
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,296
Boston Dynamics SoftBank Japan

635
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,344
Do they have any of the robotics

636
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
I'm trying to think I do

637
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:40,000
It's the company is the French company that made pepper they have a big investment there

638
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:46,912
I so yes they have never going to put pepper heads on scary demon

639
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,472
I also bought

640
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Is it shaft

641
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,664
Another robotics firm

642
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,760
Not a lot of news about shop it's like a secretive kind of

643
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Incubator type

644
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,368
Project from jsk robotics Lab at University of Tokyo

645
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
Yeah

646
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,952
So that they might be willing

647
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,744
It's something even scarier so

648
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,376
They might be because I went to their website and it said that permission forbidden like I couldn't go to the Republic website today

649
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
Yeah boy

650
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
All right

651
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,104
So let's piece this all together cuz softbank's been doing some really interesting things in the iot space first off I think there's going to be like

652
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
100 million

653
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,688
Connected devices which goes beyond

654
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,480
Or a hundred billion I mean it's

655
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,272
That's baby

656
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
Everything's gonna be connect

657
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
Stopping speed

658
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,160
And what they've done is they've got a huge investment

659
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
An arm

660
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,232
Embedded chip firm

661
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,512
Chip design firm

662
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,072
Actually recently just made a

663
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
Acquisition of

664
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
A lot of stairs

665
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:55,008
An acquisition of a stake in a company called OSI soft which does Industrial Automation

666
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Software

667
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,848
And when we start thinking about

668
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,152
Embedded Computing everywhere

669
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
Industrial Automation

670
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
And robots

671
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
What are we doing

672
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,528
It's the future

673
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Yes

674
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,088
The SoftBank is basically

675
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,880
Say hey we're going to be connected

676
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
We're going to need

677
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,256
Software-based ways to mediate that and we're going to need robots doing

678
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
A lot of the tasks

679
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,864
Spent humans using and

680
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
Environments that

681
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,936
Are less friendly

682
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,032
And they can also chase us down and kill us

683
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,360
We could you end up in reality self

684
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,456
It's obviously a big Vision player when you put it all together

685
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,760
I'm so I guess it's not surprising

686
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,576
To see SoftBank purchase Boston Dynamics

687
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856
Terms of the deal

688
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,648
Not available

689
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,256
Don't think Google ever said what they paid for Boston Dynamics I don't know if they're making money or losing money but

690
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,816
Again big picture yeah there

691
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,864
Southbank is positioning itself for

692
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,400
Industrial

693
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,960
World domination

694
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
Alright so

695
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,056
After that scary bit

696
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,592
Let's take a moment for a

697
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,664
Message from our sponsor and then we'll go into

698
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,992
A conversation that's going to make you feel good about the internet

699
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,808
We're going to have the CEO of Aqaba

700
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,088
Davida herzl

701
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,112
Talk about

702
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:19,232
How we can actually improve data collection for really granular Environmental

703
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:23,328
Yay we're going to do what's polluting

704
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
Stay tuned for all of that

705
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,544
Hey everyone we are taking a break in The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor

706
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,104
Where is TE Connectivity and I have shed

707
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,688
Cragar a general manager at TE Connectivity

708
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
How about smart

709
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
Appliances

710
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
So Chad

711
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
Remind us what to eat

712
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,368
We make connectors and sensors

713
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,672
That collect data and Power

714
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
And

715
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,768
Many devices across the world but particularly in

716
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,048
Home appliances

717
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,120
We connect refrigerators and washers and dryers

718
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
As well as

719
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,936
New connected devices like

720
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,240
Robotic vacuums doorbells

721
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,264
Thermostat

722
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,800
And video

723
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,592
Let's talk about these appliances

724
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,408
What kind of changes and Trends are you seeing

725
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,248
And we're seeing a real revolution in conductivity

726
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,320
In home appliances many of the things that are

727
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,392
Customers are looking to put into their appliances Ark raiding

728
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,928
A better user experience

729
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:27,328
And that user experience is providing devices that are smarter and connected with each other as well as providing

730
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,352
Better safety

731
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,168
More reliability and greater energy efficient

732
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,776
There are a lot of other connected devices in the home now how is that impacting

733
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,800
Appliances

734
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,848
3D digital assistants

735
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
Enabling

736
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,944
They large home appliance makers to move faster

737
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
Adopting

738
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,784
Smart conductivity between appliances

739
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,088
In many cases a digital assistant

740
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,904
Are serving as the gateway to connect

741
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
The devices

742
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
In the home

743
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,280
So how does TE Connectivity come into that interaction

744
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,608
Betsy conductivity were providing antennas

745
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,424
And sensors and connectors that are allowing

746
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,960
The communication

747
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,496
Between the device

748
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:10,336
And the digital assistant we are sensing the information

749
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,872
Inside the appliance

750
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:17,248
And through our connectors and antennas communicating that back to the digital assistant

751
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,064
I'm expecting a lot of really awesome

752
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,112
Connected features in my new appliances

753
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
But holy cow

754
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,952
Those are really tough environments

755
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,280
What kind of things is TE Connectivity doing to him

756
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:35,680
Prove reliability the risk of all these additional features and appliances there's more power in the appliances Mezmur

757
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,472
Power is in the appliance

758
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
The risk is

759
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:42,080
That there could be a failure and if there's a failure in Appliance

760
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,128
And many times can lead to

761
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
The fire

762
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,224
And that's of course something we are here to provide

763
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,760
And we're putting

764
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,296
New materials

765
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
R&R products

766
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,880
That actually prevent

767
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,440
In many cases it can eliminate

768
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,256
These potentials for fire risk or four

769
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,560
Other types of electrical failures

770
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,888
So how are you guys making your components

771
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,448
Reliable and put a really challenging in fire

772
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,264
With the Internet of Things there's a

773
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
Excellent opportunity

774
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,824
To provide

775
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,616
Better sensing of

776
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:20,736
The devices that can give our consumers and our customers information about the

777
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,808
Reliability and potentially predictive failure

778
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
Of their products

779
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
Chad

780
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,904
That sounds awesome except for the kitchen fire

781
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,184
How can I find out

782
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:36,352
You can find out more about our products at tep.com Connected home

783
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:42,752
Hey everyone welcome

784
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:47,872
Into the Internet of Things podcast this is your house is Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

785
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,944
Herzl who is the CEO of

786
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,576
Hi Stacy thanks so much for having me today

787
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,904
Oh I am so excited thanks for coming on the show

788
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,720
Because you guys are doing something near and dear to my heart

789
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,536
Constantly telling people about how to iot

790
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,328
Is really a way to

791
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,632
Get information at scale

792
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,912
Very little money

793
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,960
And then use it to do something

794
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:18,336
And you guys are doing that so you just announced this big project with Google do you want to tell us about that

795
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
So what we announced

796
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:26,272
Is that is the result of I work that we've been doing allihoopa we've instrumented Google Street View car

797
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,344
Cars with our environmental intelligence platform

798
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,392
To measure air quality and

799
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
Climate

800
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
Scale

801
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
And in our announcement

802
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
We launched the first map

803
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
From Oakland

804
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:43,424
Which we generated in in partnership with Google and the environment

805
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,008
And so what was the result

806
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:53,152
The study study generated one of the largest data sets on Urban Air Pollution ever assembled

807
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,944
And the results were

808
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,992
Resultz1

809
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:03,648
It demonstrates that our approach is highly scalable highly effective and cost-effective

810
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,184
To generate higher

811
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
Pollution

812
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:09,792
Maps of air quality and it also showed us that air quality

813
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,096
Is much more variable

814
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,888
Then anybody had ever expect

815
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,424
So you can have

816
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,704
Best air quality

817
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,264
And the worst air quality on the same block

818
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,056
And that's really important

819
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:24,896
For decision-makers you know whether it's urban planners

820
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,456
Or health insurers or

821
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:31,040
Citizens understand how they are affected

822
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
Air pollution

823
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
You really need

824
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,112
Highly granular

825
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:37,440
Highly localized information and

826
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,976
Proven that we can do it with

827
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,512
Are platform and with this

828
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Methodology

829
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,608
Awesome so let's dig into some of the tech here just for fun

830
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,632
Just for funsies

831
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,496
You called at the environmental intelligence

832
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,312
So is that just a sensor is that

833
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,592
Cloud service what is it

834
00:34:55,104 --> 00:35:00,224
Our environmental intelligence platform is a fully integrated from sensor

835
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,528
Backend 8A manager

836
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,832
Algorithm

837
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,624
That makes sense of the

838
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,648
Data coming off

839
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,208
Answers to the management system

840
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
Manage

841
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,256
All of the remotely

842
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,536
Play sensors

843
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,840
Data visualization software in the Analytics

844
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,400
So it's a fully integrated end-to-end stocking

845
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,424
Threesome

846
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,032
Selena great it is that we really see this as a massive signal processing Challenge and

847
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
We're trying to do

848
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,336
Capture signal

849
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
Songs about within the environment

850
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
And turn it into

851
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,176
Information that we

852
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,224
And that platform

853
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:33,760
Deployed

854
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,784
And multiple settings

855
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,344
Take me to Coit indoors in buildings

856
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,136
It can be deployed Outdoors

857
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,184
I'm stationary settings

858
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,232
The tops of buildings

859
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,304
And it can also be deployed on moving vehicles

860
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,328
And be able to

861
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
Degenerate

862
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,376
Insights from

863
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,936
Spencer's at highly granular

864
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,008
I'm resolution that haven't been possible before

865
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:00,128
Okay and in this case how are the sensors communicating the data back to the

866
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
The sensors are commute

867
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
Indicating

868
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,992
True Cellular Connection

869
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:09,856
And they're communicating in real-time so they're sending up data once every second

870
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
And they're also

871
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
Communicating

872
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,952
Location in a lot of other metadata

873
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
It's really important

874
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
For managing the networks

875
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,560
When they're deployed in the field but also

876
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,120
Making sense of the data after it's been

877
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Collective

878
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,936
Okay and I saw some of this

879
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,704
Estate I mean

880
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,336
How much data are we talking about in I don't know

881
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
Sure so we all at once

882
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,200
Per second and weekly cover this particular study

883
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,992
We collected data

884
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,040
From May 2015 to May 26

885
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:45,952
We collected 2.7 million data points over 14,000 miles and 100

886
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:52,352
50 days of driving and this is this is one of the largest if not the largest data sets on Urban Air Pollution

887
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,632
Ever ever assembled

888
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,168
Wow okay

889
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,728
So that's a lot of data to take

890
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,544
A lot of companies are dealing with this right now is there

891
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,336
Thinking about iot

892
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,128
Do you have advice for them on

893
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
Taking in that kind of data

894
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,456
In turning it into something that

895
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,480
Actually useful

896
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,040
For policymakers or people who are not date

897
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,832
How do you do that at school

898
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:16,928
For users right I mean I think I think so much of the focus on

899
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
IRT is either you know

900
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
Either talking about the janitor

901
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,096
The value of the data but there's a lot of work that has to be done

902
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,632
Translate that data is

903
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,424
Into information that people can

904
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,448
Use end

905
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:33,824
One of the things that that we've been doing and then there's admittedly I think an iot there's a chicken and egg

906
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
Challenge right

907
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
Because you have to

908
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
Collect the data

909
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,968
To understand what value is in it

910
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:44,832
And then you have to understand what value is in the data to understand how to optimize your data collection

911
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
We're doing here in Oakland

912
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,184
Is that we over stamp

913
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
That mean we just

914
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,256
The quantities of Jade are so huge

915
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,304
Because what we were really trying to do was

916
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,352
Learn learn where is the valley

917
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,680
The data how do we turn it into those information product

918
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:06,080
That people can use and we've been very intentional over the course of the last year we made a commitment in 2015 with Google to

919
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,384
Map communities across California

920
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,016
And what we've been doing is really using that as an opportunity to explore applications of the data and so

921
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,552
You have to creep

922
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:20,160
Room for this kind of iteration cycle but you have to be very intentional about

923
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:26,560
About the fact that there is there is a need to collect data to surface the data into then talk to users about ways the

924
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
They need

925
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,632
That data represented and so we've been talking

926
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,680
Two users in the urban planning space

927
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,240
Space space really under

928
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,800
Understand the ways in which that data needs to be reduced

929
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:41,152
An analyzed to deliver really useful information

930
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:41,920
How do you

931
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,224
Take the massive amounts of data that you

932
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,992
You have

933
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,320
And go to the process of making that useful to each differ

934
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,440
Do bring people in from that Community do you guys employee all those folks.

935
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:59,840
Have a magical machine learning box

936
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,864
We have a highly

937
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,656
MN

938
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,984
And what we've done is yes on our team we have domain expert

939
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
Who are

940
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,128
Looking at the data and using our tools to look at it through the lens of users

941
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:17,504
In the communities that they represent so whether it's a scientific Community or for example

942
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,040
In the built environment

943
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:19,808
We have

944
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,344
Former director of research

945
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,624
The US Green Building

946
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,952
It is about bringing those Jame next

947
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,256
In those areas of application

948
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,560
Reprioritize

949
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,608
And then having those

950
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
Domain expert

951
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,656
Directly engage

952
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,704
The Industries or User Group

953
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,776
That we're selling our services into to refine

954
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,824
Rrd2 products

955
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,896
And then work working very closely with our product team

956
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,968
Visualization and an interface

957
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
Team

958
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
Ensure that

959
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,552
We are creating data products

960
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,856
Serve the needs of those user groups

961
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,136
Operating

962
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,720
New territory right this is the key challenge around

963
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
Turning

964
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,816
Industrial or enterprise-scale iot data in

965
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
She's really meaningful

966
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,656
Invaluable information

967
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:07,936
I agree

968
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:12,800
So then the question is how do you charge for that do you charge based on insights and if so

969
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,848
What is that mean or do you just charge

970
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,384
Buy data iPad a pipe

971
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,480
We have a number of different application areas been in the building space for example

972
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,016
We saw environmental ontology

973
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
As a service

974
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,576
So these are managed

975
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,600
Sensor Networks

976
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,880
And there are

977
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
Subscription fee is

978
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:32,768
And for management of that network but subscription fees to the date of product

979
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,328
Intelligence that the Analytics

980
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
Provide

981
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,120
From the Sun

982
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
Your data and

983
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,936
The sensor data alone

984
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,728
Does not solve problem

985
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,824
For users in the in the built environment it's really important

986
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,152
That we that we translated into those meaningful data products and

987
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,944
And we saw them as a service

988
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:57,856
Let's talk about this cuz you got in this Oakland example there was some really interesting findings and I'd like to dig into some of these

989
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
Is because

990
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,464
There's one about it and I don't remember the street but there's one area where

991
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,768
You noticed that there was huge pollution

992
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:09,888
Brightest people were entering onto the Bay Bridge and I guess the theory was his people accelerate to

993
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,704
I guess get past the light and get on the bridge they just

994
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
It's been a lot of pollution

995
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,544
That kind of thing seems

996
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,616
Really interesting but it also seems

997
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,152
Really threatening

998
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
To maybe

999
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:29,600
Someone who owns an apartment that's right at that address and so would I look at how granular this data is

1000
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,392
I'm reminded of

1001
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:37,280
Talk to somebody in Singapore cuz they it outfitted an area of the city with noise pollution sensors in

1002
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,840
They got a lot of complaints from people who owned

1003
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,424
Apartments around places where the noise was Dean tires

1004
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,728
Because it was affecting the real estate values

1005
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,616
And so I feel like we're entering this Brave New connected world where information is just so available

1006
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,663
How are you seeing people react

1007
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
This sort of

1008
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,479
The availability of this

1009
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,551
Overall it has been

1010
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,111
Very positive and there's demand for more

1011
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,183
Right because I think in this case the data that we

1012
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,719
We collected directly relevant

1013
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,743
Demon House

1014
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,023
Enter people's house

1015
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,583
And the challenge I mean it in many ways

1016
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
No it's

1017
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:16,447
Equivalent to Revolution that we've seen in

1018
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,031
Genomic sequencing and the availability of data about your

1019
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
DNA

1020
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,847
Right it's empowering

1021
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,151
Empowering

1022
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,175
Choices

1023
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,455
Empowering

1024
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,271
More intelligent delivery of healthcare

1025
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:35,647
And so we think that there's an equivalent opportunity when it comes to environmental health

1026
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
You know when we talk about things like climate

1027
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,999
These are really abstract Concepts

1028
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,279
But when you

1029
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,351
They look at the same emissions are changing our climate

1030
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,399
At the type of local scale if he

1031
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,679
Becomes really relevant at

1032
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
The human

1033
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,983
The human health lens

1034
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,519
And that's information

1035
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,287
People want

1036
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,823
People need and

1037
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
You know if I have a child

1038
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,383
Asthma or

1039
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,199
Or if I'm an insurer that you know that is seeing

1040
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,503
Section of my population that's being

1041
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,343
For example a respiratory disease or

1042
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,647
Or other forms of diseases are connect

1043
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:12,255
I want to be able to take care of my members to take care of

1044
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,023
My child

1045
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,559
I'm in incorporate that in

1046
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:19,167
Information into decision-making so I think there's a. Of during which we have to come to

1047
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:22,751
Terms with this availability availability of this kind of information

1048
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,335
But I think it's up to us collectively to ensure that we're serving

1049
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,615
Public good

1050
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:31,455
What are the things I feel like we don't do enough of in The Internet of Things

1051
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
Community is

1052
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,551
Making sure the data that we're generating is actually

1053
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,183
Useful valid and tested so this could be anything from wearables and making sure they're actually

1054
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,719
Getting the right information

1055
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,023
All the way to something like environmental data Sol

1056
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,631
How do you make sure it's it's peer-review that it's high-quality that so people can

1057
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
Can actually trust it

1058
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
Thank you that's it that's a really

1059
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,215
Important

1060
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,495
Conversation

1061
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
Because I think

1062
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
All of this new data

1063
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,431
Informing decision and in the case of environmental data

1064
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
Urban planning

1065
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,015
Policy

1066
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
Care delivery

1067
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,599
Consumer choices and

1068
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,879
What's really important

1069
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,183
That we deliver quality data and so

1070
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,511
The fresh one of the ways we've been doing that is through a number partner

1071
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,791
What's the scientific name

1072
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,327
Immunity to validate

1073
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,375
The ways that

1074
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,239
Comparing our sensors

1075
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,543
Hybrid laboratory equipment

1076
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:34,943
Getting our methods validated and doing this with organizations like the EPA like Lawrence Berkeley National Lab

1077
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,319
The case of the Oakland study with the environmental defense fund and the University of Texas and

1078
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,367
It took us a long time

1079
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,183
We were collecting data in Oakland for year

1080
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,207
Getting it

1081
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Right

1082
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
Is really important

1083
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,535
Ensuring that were

1084
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,583
Or creative people can rely on and

1085
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,423
And delivering on our mission of really using the iot for good

1086
00:44:55,935 --> 00:45:00,287
So I looked at the state and I'm like I can see government officials being interested in

1087
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,591
But I could also see something like

1088
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,151
A community organization like

1089
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:10,271
Do you know what PTA to school I would love to be able to drill down to my school's level NC

1090
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,319
A community may not make that available

1091
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
So

1092
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,647
Are you thinking of ways to make

1093
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:22,303
Actionable insights available to people beyond the folks that will actively by the platform

1094
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,631
Yes and that's one of the most exciting aspects of gar

1095
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
Partnership with Google

1096
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,703
Is that

1097
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,727
There's a real life

1098
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,031
Kennedy to you imagine

1099
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:32,799
In a day

1100
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,103
Where this is as available as traffic

1101
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,711
And where this is as available as you have Street data is on

1102
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,503
Google Maps application

1103
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,271
Today

1104
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,551
And so I think

1105
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,087
You know there is such absolute

1106
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,391
One of the things that we're exploring

1107
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,671
And part of

1108
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:51,487
You know what we'd love to accomplish together

1109
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,279
That's awesome

1110
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:58,655
And it kind of brings up this idea that when you have the sensors you really can put them

1111
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,447
On a lot of different places

1112
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
So

1113
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,287
Where do you think the ideal places for this kind of data capture

1114
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,103
We talked about header

1115
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,127
Genius Network

1116
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,663
Brookstone networks that

1117
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,223
That combine data from sensors

1118
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,759
Floyd in a lot of location

1119
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
So

1120
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,575
And we we deploy our sensor

1121
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
I'm building

1122
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,111
Today

1123
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,159
Some of the largest air quality

1124
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,695
About the largest air quality sensor

1125
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,999
Turn networks to play today inside a building

1126
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,279
And then we also.

1127
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
Deploy them

1128
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,583
Tops of buildings

1129
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,119
We can play them on light post

1130
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,655
Stationary

1131
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:36,287
That gives you a view of the environment overtime right and so we can get a really good temporal

1132
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,847
Air quality or climate emission

1133
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,639
But by putting them on vehicle

1134
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,943
And what's really exciting about

1135
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
Trends

1136
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,247
Vehicles

1137
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,527
Mobility

1138
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,063
Is that vehicles

1139
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,135
Become a network since olives and that gives us

1140
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
Facebook

1141
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,951
Suddenly we can cover an entire

1142
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,719
City

1143
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,743
And do it at a

1144
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,511
Speed

1145
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
And scale

1146
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,559
It would be very difficult

1147
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,119
Stationary networks and what are

1148
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,167
The Oakland study shows

1149
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
Is that

1150
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,287
You need that kind of coverage because pollution is hypervariable

1151
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,079
Hyperlocal

1152
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,359
And so

1153
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,639
If you're limited

1154
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,407
2

1155
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,431
Stationery sets

1156
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,455
Pictures you're not going to

1157
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:20,319
Have data but you need to understand pollution and emission

1158
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,623
I'm sure it's also a little bit

1159
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
Temporal

1160
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,975
I imagine pollution

1161
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,511
Winter in the middle of

1162
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,279
Yeah

1163
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
Yes

1164
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,327
Exactly

1165
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:37,727
Yeah and so what we've done is in a really developed a methodology to be able to create a representative

1166
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,495
Snapshot

1167
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,543
That shows us where the hot spots are

1168
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:47,199
So just a few weeks ago Brian krzanich the CEO of Intel actually was talking about self-driving vehicles and

1169
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,991
Using them for things like

1170
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,551
Putting surveillance cameras on them this feels

1171
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,087
Very much in line with

1172
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,647
Are you looking at expanding the app

1173
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,183
Platform Beyond Maybe

1174
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,207
Air quality sensor

1175
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,255
Yes what we care about

1176
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:06,143
Is understanding the health of our environment and there's ways to to do that not just

1177
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,423
Direct measure

1178
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:10,239
Air quality sensor

1179
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
But there is

1180
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,287
Many other sensors that can

1181
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,079
Can be integrated into our platform

1182
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,383
The capture this kind of information

1183
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,175
And we're really you know again tonight

1184
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:18,943
Think that the

1185
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
Trend

1186
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
Self-driving

1187
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,015
Cars and

1188
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,575
The mobility shift that were staying in Mobility

1189
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,599
Offers up a notch

1190
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
Opportunity

1191
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:32,255
New capabilities Beyond just seeing what they're using today whether it's lidar other forms

1192
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,279
Cameras

1193
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,303
Visual senses

1194
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,351
All these other capabilities

1195
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,143
Scale

1196
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
Distribution

1197
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:42,495
Vehicles would be tremendously valuable for

1198
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,775
Companies for

1199
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,311
For policy-makers are

1200
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,127
Planners and I'm really excited about

1201
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
Boring

1202
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,687
Those kind of application

1203
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:55,039
Got it so the car isn't just going to be a computer it's going to be a big sensor

1204
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,343
That's right a big sensor that can

1205
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,623
Free all these others

1206
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:02,207
Sitel benefit beyond the permeability play

1207
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,023
Awesome so if you had one thing you could wish for

1208
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,095
One maybe technology maybe it's a business a I don't know

1209
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,911
What would it be what are we lacking today

1210
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,727
That you would love to see us implement or

1211
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,543
That you would love to buy off the shelf

1212
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,079
I think

1213
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:18,847
Power store

1214
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,151
Is that are pink one of the

1215
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,455
You know we've been we started at 9 corporate

1216
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
Mm

1217
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,759
And back then

1218
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,783
Cloud computing

1219
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,343
So now that clock

1220
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
Computing is

1221
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
Probably available

1222
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:34,207
Diffusion a player and so we should have been living through over

1223
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,999
Several years

1224
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:39,327
All of these enabling Technologies coming into into being and

1225
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
Turing

1226
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,655
And one of the one of the big ones for us

1227
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,215
Is just is really excited about is

1228
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,751
It's the work that's been happening in

1229
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,799
And being able to power these

1230
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,591
In a way that

1231
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,895
That is doesn't require intervention

1232
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,199
Got it okay well

1233
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,015
DaVita thank you so much for coming on the show that

1234
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:03,903
No thank you for having me really really excited to continue the conversation in the Itt

1235
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
Community I think

1236
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:11,327
Great stuff is coming and we're glad to be a part of the community

1237
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:17,727
For this week show thank you so much for listening and if you want more iot news you can sign up for my news

1238
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:24,127
Just let her stay see those things at Stacey on iot. Cam will see you next week
