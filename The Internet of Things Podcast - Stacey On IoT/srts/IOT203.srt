00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
Let us talk

61
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,288
All the news that

62
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
Talk about

63
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
Correction last week when we were answering

64
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Something on the iot

65
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
The podcast hotline

66
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
We said

67
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,552
That idevices switches do not work

68
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,904
They have had an Android app for quite some time

69
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
So know that

70
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
You're the Android User I have an iPhone

71
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
So I'm in the clear

72
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
Yes this was all my

73
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,400
Alright Kevin

74
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,448
Let's get started with our big news

75
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
The day which is Amazon

76
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
Asbat

77
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
Eero

78
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
Actually

79
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
They've announced that they plan to buy

80
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128
Deal is not yet closed

81
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
There is no

82
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,688
Price tag associated with

83
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,992
Bastille so it is a big mystery

84
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
I did ask

85
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
No one told me

86
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,648
Show me a surprise if we get that number and it was quite a surprise that this even happen

87
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
Yasso Iero if you guys are on

88
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,744
Familiar is a mesh Wi-Fi router

89
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
I use it in my house

90
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Actually ever

91
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,120
It basically makes it super easy to

92
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Create a WiFi network

93
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
It covers your whole home

94
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
Eero has been one of the

95
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,264
Big pioneers and mesh Wi-Fi

96
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
Why they're not the first to do it

97
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
But they definitely made it a household name

98
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
So I wrote a story about the

99
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,920
Best and in it I talked about

100
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
Why Amazon is doing

101
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
In the first reason is

102
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,808
All homes need a good wifi system

103
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
Just because you put smart device

104
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
System places you might never bring a PC

105
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
So wifi

106
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
Like nooks and crannies really

107
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
They also bought it

108
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,096
Because 0 has access to a lot of data

109
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,912
I don't know and we'll talk about this in a minute if

110
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:23,520
Amazon is ever going to change arrows privacy practices zero says right now that they're not

111
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
But right now

112
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,592
Euro nose

113
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,384
All the devices in my home

114
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
Wifi base

115
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,456
They also know where I go on the web

116
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
Because

117
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
It's my router

118
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
It's a lot of data there

119
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
And then third

120
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
Eero has a Cyrus

121
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,720
Security service called Eero plus actually subscribe to it just to see if it was worth

122
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
And this is both cyber-security soap

123
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
Protect against malware is

124
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,096
Set a beta ad blocker

125
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
It also allows for parental

126
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:55,776
Controls in this is a kind of service that I can see Amazon wanting to either offer Maybe

127
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
2 prime number

128
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,128
Or just in general to have a good

129
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
Cyber security

130
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Or connected

131
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
Devices service because

132
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
It's seeming to become

133
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
Comcast offers one

134
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
CES

135
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
Comedies like bitdefender

136
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
Cujo Norton has a

137
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
Save a little

138
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Hexagonal

139
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
Looking device

140
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
The core

141
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,071
So there's a bunch of these devices out there

142
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,119
So it makes sense that Amazon wants to

143
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
This game

144
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,191
It also makes sense to offer it as a service

145
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Then

146
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
Does it include a VPN option

147
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
It does I get a VP

148
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
PM Plus I also get a password

149
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
There's a lot there

150
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,503
So those are like the

151
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
3 reasons I think

152
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
In

153
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,879
There's also I would say Kevin is probably going

154
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
About this

155
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,463
There is the potential

156
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
To put

157
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Eero

158
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
In Wi-Fi

159
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
And combined it into a spa

160
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
My home hub

161
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
What you think

162
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:59,007
I think I wrote the story that thing that somebody should do just that about nine months ago and we don't know if they're going to do

163
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,615
Obviously in a lot of people in fact a lot of the readers of that said they don't want

164
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:09,503
They want to keep their smart home stuff and their Network your separate and that's totally understandable

165
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,319
But I wonder if that will come as an option

166
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:18,719
As an all-in-one package they wouldn't be the first to do that they being Amazon combined with Eero until I got high

167
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:23,071
Because Samsung's done this with their SmartThings wi-fi system which

168
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,167
Includes Mesh networking and a SmartThings Hub all-in-one base

169
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
This is

170
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
Appliance on the market

171
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:36,383
Today not from Amazon not from Google I really expected them to do it so they have Google Wi-Fi and Google home

172
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,687
I would expect that we Elysium

173
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
I'm from Amazon the future on this

174
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
Yes and it's worth noting the

175
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
The competitive Batman

176
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,111
So Google has their mesh wi-fi system

177
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
Samsung

178
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Has decided to

179
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Partner with

180
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
Plume

181
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
Chipotle basically wifi

182
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,583
SmartThings Hub and eventually into other products

183
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,167
And I do think that's someplace we might go which is

184
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
Instead of having

185
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
These like

186
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,615
Little access points around our house plugged in places we might just see it built into like light switches or smart speakers

187
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,663
Or a variety of other things that are already in

188
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,967
And that would be nice

189
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
Cuz I I'll be honest

190
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
I'm kind of overwhelmed

191
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,623
I was just going to say less boxes less wires it starts to become

192
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
More The Hidden

193
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,279
Teacher in the home cuz Franklin give me something to look nice

194
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,863
I really want to see them all over the house I do now

195
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
Oh wait no

196
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,959
I don't want this in my lighting though because I don't

197
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
What I mean Wi-Fi changes so fast

198
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,311
3 years from now I don't want to switch out

199
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,407
So I take my comment back I do want it in like a hub that I can

200
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
But I don't want it better than

201
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
I'm a guy so it doesn't bother me

202
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
You're so straight

203
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Change

204
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,391
Oh wait no no you're not strange you just have a different

205
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
Perspective it that's why you're awesome on the show

206
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,487
That's what you meant to say yeah

207
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
All right

208
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
So tied to this and what we saw it in the wake of

209
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
Hit the snooze witch

210
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
Shows how little we trust

211
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
Please is this idea that

212
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
Oh my gosh

213
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,287
I don't want Amazon doing all of that about me

214
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,335
Oh and a lot of people said you know

215
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,663
Where they were going to dump your oh and by the way if you want to jump your Eros

216
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
You're small

217
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Ubiquiti

218
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,295
Netgear has orbi although they do have Madam a

219
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
Integrations so

220
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
You wouldn't want to act

221
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
Say that there's also

222
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
Linksys has their velop

223
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
System

224
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,975
And a company called so

225
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Securifi

226
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
They actually

227
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
I don't know they pioneered the match but they were one of the

228
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
First companies out there with a

229
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Mesh system

230
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
And they're actually a startup

231
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
Company so they have

232
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
A mesh Wi-Fi

233
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
Dumb as well

234
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
So those are some options if your

235
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
I can't have this

236
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Okay

237
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
The other ass

238
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,943
That we should talk about is the idea that Amazon is sucking

239
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
What the state of right after they did the Eero aqua

240
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
Position story came out in Bloomberg

241
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,623
That interviewed some of the people who are working with the

242
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
Madam a

243
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
Program and it talks about

244
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Amazon trying to get

245
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Accessed

246
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
Data

247
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
About

248
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
When your turn

249
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
Lights on and off

250
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
When you're using things

251
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,935
Not just when you ask Madame a to do it

252
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
But all the time

253
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Wonderful

254
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
In

255
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
You don't

256
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,823
Amazon says and I actually believe them

257
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,383
They're getting this because they wanted antissa

258
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
If they want to understand

259
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
How someone

260
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Daily life at

261
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
So you can

262
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
See patterns.

263
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Anticipated

264
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,087
We talk about this

265
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
The time on the show

266
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
But

267
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Most people are like

268
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
I don't trust you

269
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
Are you going to use it for advertising

270
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,279
Today Amazon says they do not

271
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Might be in the feet

272
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
Sure

273
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
And that's where

274
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
There's a huge breakdown and Trust

275
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
With the iot

276
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
I really don't know how we're going to solve

277
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:46,335
Yeah there's two thoughts that come to mind here from an advertising perspective I don't

278
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,663
Think that's going to be an issue in the reason I say that is

279
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,015
What's a your surfing on the web know you're giving Google maybe all this data

280
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,319
Right where you go what you're looking for

281
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
And it will recommend products

282
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,647
Why when you talk about off home

283
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
And devices in the home

284
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
You're not

285
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,351
Doing that much with them yours turn things on or off the closing door the only thing I can think of

286
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
Much wider range of information is from the TV and we're going to talk about that later in the show because that's

287
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,823
Voicemail question has to do with privacy and security on smart TVs

288
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,431
So I'm not concerned from an advertising perspective and I don't think most people should be

289
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
However

290
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
There is a

291
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,783
Very valid perception that win

292
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
An individual buy something

293
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,879
What is the phone tablet

294
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
It's up to them how they use it

295
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
And

296
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,791
I think people will have a problem with Amazon and Google and other company

297
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Knowing

298
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
Am I home right now

299
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
Did I go out through this door

300
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
How many people are in the house and so on

301
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,239
That's where I think people are and should rightly be concerned about

302
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,847
And honestly I mean it's very clear from my patterns at home that I work

303
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
Or maybe I don't work

304
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
Maybe I look

305
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
Like a stay-at-home mom

306
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,247
I don't know but those are not things I necessarily want

307
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,111
No and then the other flip side of this is and I don't worry about the so much with Amazon and Google

308
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,647
But what if that data gets hacked

309
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,487
What if I can see into my house and you know exactly

310
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
Person is clearly on vacation

311
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,983
Yeah I mean innocent the smart home is both the solution and the problem

312
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
The solution is having

313
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
Smart devices that indicate

314
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
Your house being broken into

315
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,431
How did they even in your house

316
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
So

317
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
Honest friend

318
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
This is not something

319
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
For now

320
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
I'm going to trust Amazon with

321
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,391
But I don't feel as blase is

322
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
And I am seriously

323
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
Rethinking a lot of my

324
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
Relationships with these cup

325
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
Unfortunately I'm not sure what I'm going to

326
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
That you about it

327
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
Gizmodo has a great article actually from

328
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Kashmir Hill

329
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,679
This week and it is called

330
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
I cut the Big 5 Tech Giants for my life

331
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
It was hell

332
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,823
And holy cow it was I really recommend to put a link to this

333
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
A story that you read this because

334
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,407
Was very hard for her to do her

335
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
Her job and

336
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
I think it was like a series were

337
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,295
Birchwood live without one of the major tech companies

338
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
Products and services for a week

339
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,159
So I don't know if the store you have is a wrap up

340
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,743
Yeah she live without one of them for a week and then

341
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
The final

342
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
Yeah it is an omen

343
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Situation

344
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Mary Harper

345
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
So

346
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,031
Sirius. Here I do fundamentally believe

347
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,103
That we can use this kind of data to make our lives easier and more

348
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,151
More convenient but I also do believe that things

349
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
Gotten way out of

350
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Also we should

351
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
Be rethinking

352
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
This

353
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
And I'm not even sure how to do

354
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
Define this so

355
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
This is what I'm worth

356
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
On for like the next month or so

357
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
That's because this is changing

358
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
Let's move on to something a little bit more fun

359
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
And useful

360
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
Possibly used

361
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
That's true

362
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,911
So I don't know about you but

363
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Baidu

364
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
Fight with my husband in bed

365
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
Over his Mosaic cover Steeler I'll be honest

366
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
And I'm actually

367
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,847
Can crutches on his territory

368
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
I like sprawled out in the

369
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
So

370
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
Ford may have a solution

371
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:08,063
Yeah I don't fight with your husband in bed but I still think this is an interesting situation and it came from

372
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
Fords

373
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,695
Lotus Group in Dallas

374
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
Got a one-off

375
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Products

376
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:20,607
That is Courtney Ford Lane keeping bed now you understand the auto rep

377
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,959
This is a bed that is built with a conveyor belt inside it

378
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:31,359
And issue is when somebody rolls over to hog up the bed

379
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,271
Conveyor belt will move entire both of you in the bed to even out

380
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
The bet so you're not

381
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
Infringing on somebody's Lane

382
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,183
Second sister

383
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Cars

384
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:52,351
It's pretty interesting I would have liked it more if it actually lift it up and roll the person over who is trying to hog the bed

385
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:58,239
But it doesn't do that it just shifts both people back to the middle of the bed because the bed is gone

386
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
And uses

387
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,103
Pressure points to determine when maybe somebody is not on their side so

388
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
Rather interesting funny video to say quite honestly

389
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,967
And you can't buy this is a concept

390
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
What I would like

391
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,575
His Biz basically reminds me of I don't know if you have siblings

392
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
We be at the back

393
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
The car

394
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
And like you draw the line.

395
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,463
He's such a he's touching me

396
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
I put my finger over the imaginary

397
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,095
Maybe like hahaha

398
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,167
This might be good actually in the backseat of a car

399
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,471
It's you could just like conveyor them

400
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,079
Little electric shock to win

401
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,967
In other news there's been two deals in the homestead

402
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Security world

403
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
And as you guys

404
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,903
Remember security is basically the Trojan Horse to get a lot of consumers into the smartphone

405
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,695
So you see a lot of

406
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,767
Annie's buying security-focused products

407
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
Because

408
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
Consumers will

409
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
We spend money on

410
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
Where is they may not spend it on can

411
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Thermostat

412
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
First

413
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
Then it's a foot in the door

414
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
So yes they get their foot in the door and then poof

415
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
People start buying all kinds

416
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
So

417
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
A company called

418
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Bode

419
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,663
They make a really good actually

420
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Security

421
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
They partnered with a company called

422
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Hellotalk

423
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Hellotech will actually

424
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
Do it for peace

425
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
They will install the security

426
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
Customs for them

427
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,207
Which is nice because there's a whole crowd of people out there who are like

428
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,767
Yeah the smart home stuff is too intimidating I want to mess

429
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
And then ATT

430
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
Which is

431
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
B name

432
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
Is actually acquired

433
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Company called lifeshield

434
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
And like Shield

435
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Actually make

436
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
XA DIY

437
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Security system

438
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,663
So this way ATT is moving deeper into the DIY mark

439
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
Pick up some of that Mark

440
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
Because basically

441
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
The security Market

442
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,087
Professional and has been stuck around 20%

443
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Are monitored

444
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
And

445
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
ATT camp

446
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
This growth

447
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
At the bottom

448
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
So two deals in that space

449
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Worth

450
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
And now let's talk about iot

451
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
At 4

452
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
There've been some retrenchment

453
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Yes

454
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
Unexpected ones

455
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
Yes well one of them's unexpected

456
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Because we missed it

457
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:13,407
So I'll confess that back in December Samsung said that they were closing their iot module business

458
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,711
Does the arctic module business and this

459
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
Surprised us mostly because

460
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
We saw a notice on the Arctic

461
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
Cloud website saying

462
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
Hey for shutting this down

463
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
What what happened

464
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,767
Luckily business Korea was on top of the situation because they're about the only ones who reported

465
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Yes

466
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,863
So basically in December Samsung said there

467
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
After 4 years

468
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
They're pulling the plug on Arctic

469
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,495
It employed slightly fewer than a hundred employees

470
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Arctic wolf

471
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,079
This module and it was also a cloud platform

472
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
It makes sense

473
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
That this happened

474
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,991
I had talked to people who said Arctic was kind of not

475
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,551
All that when it came to doing scaled out

476
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
Deployment it was good for

477
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
Prototyping butt

478
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,463
In Samsung also wanted to get all in on their SmartThings cloud

479
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Or iot

480
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
So I think those two things

481
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Probably

482
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
Tight end to end

483
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
And surprisingly

484
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
Samsung's decision to

485
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
And this back in December at now

486
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
It's going to close as of

487
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
So it already closed

488
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
February 1st

489
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
You can no longer

490
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
But it's not the only one

491
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
No it's not the only one

492
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
This comes as a bit of a shock as well

493
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,783
Google has an update on Android things that other platform that we don't talk about it too much

494
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,159
And that's probably cuz nobody really uses it and I think what they're saying is

495
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,999
Partners to create products

496
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:37,119
Android things the successes if only come in smart speakers and smart displays

497
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
So as of this week

498
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,983
They say they are refocusing enjoy things as a platform

499
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
Just those two devices

500
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,895
So you no longer want to be a widespread build all your IRT stuff on Android things and

501
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
Sissy putting this out in previous podcast

502
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,015
Android things was a little chunky

503
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
In terms of

504
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:59,903
Creating devices with a very thin footprint when it comes to software it just was to

505
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
Monkey could really make anything

506
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
Yes and you had to have

507
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
Way more memory

508
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
And way more process

509
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
Power that most like

510
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,375
Edge true sensors and true

511
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
Anything running on MCU

512
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
Without a team is 1 gig of memory

513
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
It was up there I don't recall the exact words

514
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:21,919
Reset devices with small amounts

515
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
It was the bottom line is it

516
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Or is he

517
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
Which is not good

518
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
For you know

519
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:34,719
Right so of course Google still has an astounding in this announcement cloud

520
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,815
What do they really have for the small device

521
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Market

522
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,631
Nothing yeah I think it's really

523
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,935
We're just going to give you the ability to build

524
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,495
Google home actions and routines and such

525
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
And maybe we'll see an acquisition

526
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
I'll ponder that

527
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,127
All right let's go to some

528
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Small

529
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
Arlo

530
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,479
Which is the publicly traded company

531
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,831
Netgear spun out for its Arlo security camera business they had really good

532
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,135
Q4 revenues probably everybody getting our local

533
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,463
They are expecting Revenue

534
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Instafollow

535
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,279
19 +

536
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
That is unsub

537
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
Uprising

538
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
They

539
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,399
Reported Revenue in the fourth quarter of

540
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Almost 130 million

541
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
So yay

542
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,287
And total 2018 Revenue was 472

543
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
But

544
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,639
They actually predict in 2019 they're going to make less than

545
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
Significantly less than

546
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,967
That almost a hundred million less than that

547
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
Or maybe just

548
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Which is

549
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:37,951
And I think it speaks to the same thing that happened with GoPro and Fitbit and

550
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Everyone

551
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,279
The tries to get into the connected consumer Hardware Mar

552
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
It is hard

553
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
So

554
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
I don't know what to say about that

555
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Other than

556
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,215
Having a single device strategy

557
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,031
Is tough and Arlo's going to bring out new products but

558
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
It's still tough

559
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy

560
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
All right

561
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
Apple Smartwatch news

562
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
Yes I better wearable

563
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,247
Which is this is an interesting Twist on wearables

564
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,039
Sony has something a baby

565
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:09,439
Actually a product I've had in Japan for quite some time but they just brought to the UK I have not heard of it until this week is

566
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
It's called the winner

567
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Wrist wrap

568
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
Basically

569
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,631
You can get it with a watch face from Sony or you can just get the strap and attach it to

570
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
Your Rolex if you have on it's up to you

571
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:26,079
What is Stone is it's taken all the smarts from a smartwatch and put it into a module that goes on the band

572
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,175
Any watch as notifications Fitness tracking contact list

573
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
Payments

574
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:37,343
Very small OLED screen to show the incoming messages notifications they have an act

575
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,487
Actor model with a much larger screen regardless it's not something I look at all the time in the fact

576
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
Watch

577
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,815
Lastrap you're literally going to be looking at

578
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,655
Back of your wrist not the watch face for all these notifications

579
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
It's also not cheap

580
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
It's about

581
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
$50 US

582
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Yeah

583
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,359
GPS in the act in one heart rate sensor and someone

584
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,175
I don't know a price I don't see it really being

585
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,223
Widespread success

586
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,039
Watch out there if you've got that much money.

587
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
You're probably going to be using that right

588
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,879
Well yes but keep in mind

589
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:15,743
Android has about 80% of the worldwide smartphone market and therefore

590
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:22,143
20% or less have Apple devices which are required for the Apple watch so you're still a big pool of potential customers

591
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,959
But it doesn't matter I mean this is just way too much

592
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,263
Apple Smartwatch for Android

593
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
200 $300

594
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:34,943
It's interesting that they did not go with an Android Wear Google Wear OS watch the guy said let's try this

595
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,223
Do they have one of the past

596
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,295
But it's been a couple years since it was updated I think four years now so

597
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,391
But maybe we'll learn something

598
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
I say that every year

599
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
By the way

600
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Resume

601
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
Okay

602
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,095
So other news

603
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
Define a little bit for you

604
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Lucy Foxx

605
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
They are

606
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,959
Low-power wide area

607
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
They're based

608
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
And

609
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,335
Basically this is not a lot of bandwidth

610
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
But

611
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,919
So tell me about the data

612
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:09,247
Really cheap you can bet these sensors and things and then

613
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
Kafka communication

614
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,623
And it's for like smoke detectors or parking

615
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,159
Sensors are all kinds

616
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,720
Well I've always been a little skeptical of it

617
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
Because they're

618
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536
More like Laura is

619
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
What is more open

620
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
But sick foxes

621
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
Is all-purpose

622
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
But

623
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
This week

624
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,752
They basically said that on the client side they're making public their radios

625
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,544
This means anybody can

626
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,848
Develop and build sigfox radios

627
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
With the spec

628
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,176
If you want to make those radios talk back to

629
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
To the cloud you're going to have to pay

630
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
Server-side

631
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
Services

632
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
That's worth

633
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
But

634
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
It's actually a

635
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Good move

636
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
Because now

637
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,416
We can one see how popular

638
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
People decide they want

639
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,024
Embed this Orville radios for this into

640
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,584
You know this could broaden their market and make it a lot

641
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,936
Along with the radio spec to have an API

642
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,264
Matt will talk back to sigfox in the cloud

643
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:07,872
So that's another way that we can track how many developers actually using an API

644
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
So we can keep an eye on that

645
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,968
I think it's smart because they try to go It Alone

646
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
For so long

647
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
And

648
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,784
Benzo

649
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,088
Dietary they still are least

650
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:22,720
They're trying to Branch out because the only way they're going to probably expand against the competition is to open up a little bit more if not

651
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Additionally in the future

652
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,840
And we are also seeing so with low-power wide-area

653
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
We're basically seeing

654
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,216
Laura on the unlicensed side we're seeing cellular nb-iot

655
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,288
And a little bit of cat M1 if you're in the

656
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
Nikki West

657
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,104
And then a lot of the other companies

658
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
It started in the space

659
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
Fallen by the wayside

660
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
So there was

661
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
I can't even remember the name of

662
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
There are a couple other come

663
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
How do you spell boxes

664
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
Still around

665
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,088
And hopefully this

666
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
Guess this helps them

667
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,672
Guilin at the potential to

668
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
So there's all that

669
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
SNL

670
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
Talk about

671
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
Habitat

672
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
Kevin yes

673
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,864
Some of our listeners have

674
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
Call us about habitat

675
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
Muslim love it

676
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Quite frankly

677
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:11,616
And what habitat is the biggest draw for Habitat which is a smart home hub that has all the four major radios Bluetooth wife

678
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,896
Sicp in Z-Wave

679
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:19,296
The biggest draw is that it's all local all the data all the rules all the animations all happened on the

680
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,112
The device there's no Cloud involved from that aspect

681
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:28,512
And that helps you from a privacy standpoint that helps that your internet connection is down but your home Wi-Fi still up you haven't lost

682
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,328
Any functionality to your devices

683
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
I totally got that

684
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:37,728
However if there's ever been a product and all the products I've reviewed since 2003

685
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,032
Simultaneously love

686
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,336
And hate at the same time it is the habitat

687
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,128
Oh wow those are big words for

688
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
Kevin tissue usually

689
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,688
Kevin is the nicest

690
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
He's Fair

691
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
And he's also like

692
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,040
It may not be for me but it's for someone

693
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
And actually

694
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,648
It's funny you say that because there is definitely a crowd I would

695
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,696
Heartily recommend the habitat

696
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
Elevation Hub 2

697
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,280
And there's a whole crowd that I would say do not

698
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
Touch this light

699
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,400
It reminds me let me go to the crowd that I don't recommend it for. Explain why

700
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,240
It reminded me all the setup process reminded me of

701
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,288
What it takes to get Linux running

702
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,688
Honor PC you got to get into the Cody got to get into Eternal you have to download drivers and things like that

703
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
Tweakin tweakin tweakin to it

704
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,528
And for a lot of people in the smartphone space

705
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:27,136
They don't want to do that and there are perfectly good products probably good hubs that

706
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:30,464
Make it very easy to add devices to set up

707
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
Automations in routine

708
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:36,096
How to connect multiple devices together into rooms in group and so on and so forth

709
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,936
And you have a nice pretty little app it just does everything for you

710
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,496
It's nice and easy to look at and use and so on so forth

711
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
Habitat is not bad

712
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,336
In fact I talked to the folks at habitat

713
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,896
Couple weeks back when discussing this

714
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
Product and I said

715
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:56,064
It seems to me like the your Hub is really like an if this then that on steroids and relaxing is very powerful

716
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,344
So that's a good thing

717
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
But it's not

718
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,696
It's not as user-friendly as some of the other options that are out there

719
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:08,096
And it doesn't seem to be for controlling devices and what I mean by that is there is no app for habit

720
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,168
Literally there is a small web server

721
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,496
Running locally on the device that you access

722
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
Google browser

723
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,544
On a phone

724
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,824
Computer Etc

725
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,920
That's what shows all your devices at 3 set everything up and so on

726
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:28,320
To get to controls we actually turn something on or off you have to create your own little dashboard switch is it took me awhile

727
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,856
I'll figure it out I'll just leave it at that

728
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,672
It's just not meant for the same purpose it is

729
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,720
Who hardly meant for automation

730
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,768
You just set it up and forget about it

731
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,072
An unexpected Works fantastic

732
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,632
It's great setting things up though is a challenge

733
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,680
I struggle sometimes I even had to

734
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,264
Try and install some device Handler tour drivers

735
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,664
Similar to if your SmartThings Hub user you may have seen drivers wear it with your building groovy that turn Java like it

736
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
Change the language

737
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
And that will

738
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
Get your device working

739
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:03,136
You know I struggle with that I even downloaded and and try to install when I got a ton of hers and I don't know why the good news is there's a hole

740
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
Big passion community

741
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,976
With habitat they have a lot of

742
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024
Community Forum activity

743
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,424
The documentation is a little weak in my opinion than your little to give in a box and then told to go to the website to figure it out

744
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
You have to want to

745
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
Spend the time

746
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,288
To get rid of Isis

747
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
Discovered

748
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
Groot

749
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:27,456
Get your dashboard tiles if you want to do actual on off by touch screen and so on and you can add

750
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
Voice control with

751
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,296
Matinee and with Google that works fine

752
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:37,440
Again except for the crowd who probably either already has grown or outgrown the traditional easy hub

753
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,536
Or somebody plays with openhab or home automation and raspberry pies

754
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,168
If you want those people this is great it's a great products $99 no fee or anything like that

755
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,960
The bee breath of devices are

756
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,520
Square very good what you going to spend a lot of time

757
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
And if you want to take her

758
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,104
Do it to your heart's content this isn't device radio

759
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,920
That whole intersection of the DIY I just want to

760
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,968
Plug it in and have it work in

761
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
Set up automation

762
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,296
Macro icons in an app

763
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:08,160
I just can't recommend it for those folks as they're going to get frustrated even I was frustrated at times and I've

764
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,488
Set up a bunch of hot so that's where I stand on it it's

765
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,048
A great product for the right group of people

766
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
That's fair

767
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
I mean in nuts

768
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
I try to be fair

769
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,424
I feel that you were totally fair

770
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,472
Cuz yes I was looking at some of this and I miss

771
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,520
I was excited about it but I also

772
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,824
I won't lie I was looking at that and I was like

773
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,104
I think I would have kept in it

774
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
How is Kevin review.

775
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,480
That's how I got this review you and I see yeah I think

776
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,064
Listen to you and I I mean having done this kind of stuff for years now

777
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,648
We could make this work for sure I've no doubt and I did make it work

778
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
But it was

779
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,976
Not easy at Ransom challenges some errors

780
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,816
At one point you would send me a Samsung button for example of zigbee button

781
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:53,472
I use that to try and turn on my Cree bulb once I hooked up the button and had I had to tell the button what to do

782
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,288
Turn the light on

783
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
I did it I hit it

784
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,712
And I took a while to troubleshoot all that and it's just

785
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,784
We can figure this stuff out and a lot of our listeners here

786
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
Could figure it out

787
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
Petit mass-market

788
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,136
Didn't want to figure it out they just want us to work

789
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,672
I'm pretty sure some of our listeners

790
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,464
Great listeners

791
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
Yeah

792
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,536
And I also know that some of them

793
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
This Hub and they love it

794
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,608
Obvious reasons privacy

795
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,656
There's no redundancy you don't need anything

796
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:27,520
Always be running and they have total control over everything so I get it I really do

797
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,848
Well if you want more on this Kevin has postage

798
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,152
Review and we will link to it in the show.

799
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
So look

800
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,760
For that and speaking of privacy

801
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
This brings us to

802
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,344

Now

829
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
Let's go to this week's question

830
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,144
It is from

831
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Chris

832
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Hi Stacy and Kevin

833
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,752
My name is Chris and I'm calling from Winnipeg Manitoba

834
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,544
Canada and my question relates

835
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,824
2 Smart TV

836
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,872
Home theater package

837
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,944
I know there's a lot of smart TVs these days

838
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,992
Some will have digital assistants

839
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
Various

840
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,296
Streaming services

841
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,088
We currently have no Smart Hub

842
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,368
Or smart devices

843
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,928
Except for our Chromecast device in our current

844
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,696
TV

845
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,488
We're planning a run over base

846
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
And I want the technology

847
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,304
But I also want

848
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,072
Security

849
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,608
I don't want a television with a

850
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,632
Camera built-in

851
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,192
I want to limit the amount of information sharing

852
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,496
And if I get a digital assistants

853
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
Is Google or madam

854
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,824
I want the ability to turn off

855
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
Microphone

856
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Play Don Juan

857
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Cordings occur

858
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,200
Do either of you have any recommendations

859
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,504
I love listening to The Show by the way

860
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
Okay

861
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
Chris

862
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
1

863
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
I too would want to

864
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,440
Nice basement renovation

865
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
If I were living in Winnipeg

866
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
Good Lord

867
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
That is

868
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
That is cold

869
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
So

870
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,864
This is a hard question

871
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,888
And I'm glad you asked

872
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,448
Because we learned a lot about Smart Television

873
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,520
I was aware that is hard to buy a brand new awesome

874
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,336
Big screen TV that is amazing

875
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,360
And not have it

876
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
Smart that's

877
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
Pretty much impossible

878
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
But we also learned

879
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,272
That there to privacy things you should worry about with you

880
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
Televisions

881
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,320
One is called

882
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344
Automatic content

883
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,136
Ignition and basically

884
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,672
This is something that TV makers of

885
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,696
Putting in their TV

886
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,512
2015 and they basically try to identify

887
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,816
Every television show that you are watch

888
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,352
And send that data to the

889
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,632
TV maker so they

890
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
Target advertising

891
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,448
Sounds like

892
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,264
But two and this is what I think you're mostly talking

893
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
Is

894
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,056
Microphone

895
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,616
What's a lot of these televisions have microphones on them

896
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,896
Where the remotes have mic

897
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
It's girly

898
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
It's hard to tell

899
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
If they do or not

900
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,528
So Kevin's going to talk about microphones

901
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,088
And then I'll talk about how to disable automatic

902
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,648
Microphones

903
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:27,744
Yeah we did some research I literally went to Samsung

904
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,584
TV site because Samsung is probably the premier brand right now it's

905
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,704
It's not the top one it's got to be in the top three for anybody's looking for a TV

906
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,008
Renovation like you're talking about Chris

907
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
And

908
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:45,664
They talked about Bixby and how it works a little bit but I had to go into the device manual

909
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,968
Before even learning how

910
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,736
Basalt

911
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Shakes down

912
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
So some TVs

913
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,856
Have the remote with microphone built-in

914
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
Well actually all of them do

915
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,672
As far as I can tell from Samsung

916
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
What others

917
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,000
Also have I can always listening mode

918
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,560
Pink Samsung calls it to me like

919
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
Voice

920
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,120
Wake up or something to that effect

921
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,424
You can disable that which is good

922
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,008
It's not clear though from the spec sheet if those TVs

923
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:17,408
As a microphone built into the TV or not even doesn't say that the remote has a macro

924
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,784
In aspects even though we know it does from looking at pictures of microphone in the end the mail how to use Bixby

925
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
So

926
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,880
What I would recommend is no matter what TV you think you're going to buy

927
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,160
Before you buy it

928
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Look

929
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,720
Online for user manual

930
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,744
And see

931
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
If you can shut the microphone off

932
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
If you can

933
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,376
If there is a microphone exactly

934
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,472
The reason I say this because there is in the manual I think says hey if you want to use Bixby

935
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:47,872
Just press the button on the remote but on a newer TV it says that an additional and says you can change the setting to

936
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,152
Wake up

937
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,176
To be on or off

938
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,712
To me that's always listening

939
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,296
So you could use the button or not use the button for that particular set

940
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:59,904
So you got to make sure that there's a way to disable the always listening functionality

941
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,304
Quite honestly and it is so hard to tell I would not buy the TV and then try and figure this out I would try and figure this out and then by the T

942
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,352
TV that suits my needs and requirements

943
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,680
So basically we're telling you you have to read the manual

944
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,216
And you should probably

945
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
We also read

946
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,032
The Privacy policies to understand

947
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,824
What date of the TV is even

948
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,896
And again you should do this before you actually perch

949
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
And yes

950
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,456
This does suck

951
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
It's unfair

952
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,248
And I hate it

953
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
And

954
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
The other aspect of

955
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,600
This which is the automatic content recognition

956
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
Ignition which may or may not upset you

957
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,672
A link to an article

958
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
Talks about this

959
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,256
Consumer Reports but basically

960
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,560
A lot of the televisions that now have

961
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
Smart's built into it

962
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,888
You can turn that off

963
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,912
But it's different

964
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
And the settings were very good

965
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
Vitality

966
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:50,848
In some cases though there are certain TVs such as those that are built on the

967
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
Android platform

968
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:55,200
So like Sony televisions you actually can't opt out of

969
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,248
Google's privacy policies

970
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,016
When you

971
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
Turn that TV on

972
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
So you're going to be sharing data with

973
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,136
Situation and

974
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:09,024
Yeah that's concerning to mean it's not just Android TVs because I've had a Vizio TV for example

975
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,096
That if you can set the terms of service and those included

976
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
That means you

977
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Sharing

978
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,216
Your viewing habits with potential advertisers

979
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,776
If you did not accept that the TV would not work

980
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,104
And the same thing with the Amazon Fire

981
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,432
TV's those won't work unless you

982
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
Looks like on okay

983
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,248
And you may be like well of course

984
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,272
Amazon television

985
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
But

986
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,368
Again the fact that you have to buy the device

987
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,160
To see this is really concern

988
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,952
To me and I will also say that video

989
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:43,840
A couple years ago actually got in trouble with the FTC because they did not make that data collection and then sharing very

990
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
Very clear

991
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
DC find them

992
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,960
What I will say here

993
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
And I don't like it

994
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,520
Is Whit television

995
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
You got to do a lot of research

996
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Before you buy

997
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,896
And once you buy you may actually get caught off guard

998
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
Bye

999
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,944
The terms of service

1000
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,224
They may not be in the mail

1001
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
He may not be able to see it there

1002
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,576
Kevin and I think that in your spec sheet

1003
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,112
You should probably say if you have a mic

1004
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,696
I think that's probably good for all connected devices going for

1005
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:16,352
And the same goes for cameras and Chris brought that up and I haven't seen too many TVs that have cameras are out there I think that

1006
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
Easy to avoid

1007
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,168
So I would call on manufacturers to

1008
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,960
City that I would call and Regulators to start me

1009
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,496
That those words

1010
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,264
Things Are

1011
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
Very explicit

1012
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568
You buy something

1013
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,104
And cut it around out here

1014
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
Your question

1015
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,408
If you buy a TV and

1016
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,200
Can you read all this in this research and

1017
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
You feel like you're sick

1018
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,272
Then I would say if you have a Google home

1019
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
Or

1020
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,064
Amazon device

1021
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,344
Those all have

1022
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,112
Have the ability to

1023
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
Manually shut off

1024
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,440
So

1025
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,720
Again I think

1026
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,280
If you want to voice control your television

1027
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,560
You're kind of stuck

1028
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,840
Sharing a lot of data that

1029
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,864
That you may not want to share

1030
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
And that's unfortunate

1031
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,168
Cuz it is kind of

1032
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
Matinee turn on Netflix

1033
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
Haji

1034
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
Turn on

1035
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
YouTube TV

1036
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,104
Turn on YouTube TV

1037
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,176
So with convenience comes apparently a loss of privacy

1038
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:07,552
And what's even worse is that loss of privacy may not be explicit

1039
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,112
So sorry for the bad news there

1040
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
And the long research project

1041
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,184
Ahead of you

1042
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,976
Good luck with your basement

1043
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:15,744
Renovation

It's midnight Eastern Time

1052
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,592
To win a WeMo dimmer switch

1053
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
Yay

1054
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:32,896
And now

1055
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,688
Stay tuned for

1056
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Our Guest

1057
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,224
This week

1058
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,504
Louis LaTour

1059
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
Who is the

1060
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,320
CEO of greenwave

1061
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,112
And we are going to be talking about

1062
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,392
The risc V

1063
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
Architecture

1064
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:48,000
Superchips which sounds super nerdy but we're talking about how it can really improve

1065
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
Battery life

1066
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,560
For The Internet of Things

1067
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:57,472
Everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is

1068
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
Urban X

1069
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:04,896
It is an accelerator for startups reimagining the city life and I have one of the participants in the urban Expo

1070
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
Program here to talk to us today

1071
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,248
Meet seraphim who is the CEO

1072
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
Of Newman

1073
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:14,112
So why don't we get started by having you tell me a little bit about what numina

1074
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:21,280
What is a data utility for City what that really means is we make a sensor that sounds delightful

1075
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,352
And measures all different modes of traffic and streets

1076
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,680
The where traditionally bunnies have only looked at car traffic

1077
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
We actually attack

1078
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:35,872
Graphtreon bicycle scooters wheelchairs by the trash can you name it even among the hickey alert

1079
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,152
Traffic we differentiate

1080
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,200
Cars and buses from track

1081
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
And other types

1082
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
Vehicle

1083
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:47,136
In a completely privacy persuade cuz I are main differentiator from other State traffic cameras

1084
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:51,232
We're really focused on providing intelligence without surveillance

1085
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,512
And this intelligence

1086
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,280
Empowered

1087
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,816
Interactive design places

1088
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
Not just for cars but for

1089
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,680
Do you have a big vision for the future of cities

1090
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
Yeah I think

1091
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,984
We Are Young

1092
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
Especially in the United

1093
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,664
State cities being kind of grades of drinks for cars and what's really exciting to me is

1094
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,760
Thinking about all the ways that we can use our public and shared

1095
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:20,160
When we don't have to allocate so much space to cars when either cars are shared or

1096
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
Or cities are just

1097
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:28,608
Do things prioritize other modes of travel and that's what you meant it. We provide data around all the things

1098
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,912
Newton Street so that we can design our street

1099
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:37,312
To equitably accommodate not just cars but everything else then maybe that in the future is real

1100
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,360
Watch that automatically pick up your trash

1101
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,688
Shore dancing green face instead of mint

1102
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,736
You guys were the first cohort

1103
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,528
Of the urban X Program

1104
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,808
What did you get out of it

1105
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,880
Applying to or joining Urban

1106
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,904
We had

1107
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,744
A prototype that was really Frankenstein together

1108
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
It was.

1109
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,840
Playpen D cell batteries and a lot of special part

1110
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:05,728
We were excited about urbanaxes because it gave us access to BMW engineer

1111
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:11,616
You actually help us design our first design for manufacture and that first version of our sensor

1112
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:18,016
We did manufacturer and deploy in for City we also broke that version a hundred different ways

1113
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:24,160
And now we have our Gen 2 Center will be live in about a dozen community

1114
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,952
Quitter and Wild

1115
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,256
It's a bit more refined now

1116
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,792
We actually still

1117
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:35,424
Use a lot of the same design principles and the same form factor that are organized

1118
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
Designer

1119
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
Hawkeye

1120
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Breach

1121
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,008
Excellent so weird

1122
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,568
People go to find out more about urbanex

1123
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,848
Or

1124
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:49,248
If you're interested in urban axes amazing accelerator you can apply now at Urban

1125
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,528
I've been asked.

1126
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,064
Lashify

1127
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,112
And to learn more about numina

1128
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,672
Go to numina

1129
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,768
. co. Numina. Co and we're hiring

1130
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,800
Everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

1131
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,848
This is your host Stacey Higginbotham

1132
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
And today's guest

1133
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
What is Louis

1134
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,664
Leo Tire

1135
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,736
Who is the CEO of Green Wave technology

1136
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
Hello how are you

1137
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,576
Good morning I will thank you

1138
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,928
Awesome alright so I promised our listeners that we would be talking about

1139
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,720
Chip's my favorite

1140
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,512
And you guys are building

1141
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,816
Processor for The Internet of Things

1142
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,840
That uses

1143
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,632
Risc V Technologies

1144
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,168
So let's start

1145
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,240
By telling them a little bit about your startup

1146
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
And what you're trying to do

1147
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:48,384
This is what we call a coyote application processor

1148
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,712
Application processor a processor

1149
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,248
Not specialized bikes

1150
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,832
Shooting to do very well certain application

1151
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
It's about to come to an understanding

1152
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,744
Typically it's about analyzing image down vibration but also biological

1153
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
And we do that

1154
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,328
Is an extreme energy efficient

1155
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:14,240
What we are looking after our use cases that works on the battery for yours

1156
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,800
Got it so something they can take it in

1157
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,336
It sounds like both analog

1158
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,360
And digital

1159
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
And process them

1160
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,432
With low battery

1161
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
Absolutely

1162
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,296
We have no power sensors or small processors

1163
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,600
You stick it on the wall and you forget it for you

1164
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,648
I like it I love forgetting about

1165
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
I hate when they

1166
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
Me for battery changes

1167
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Okay

1168
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,000
So

1169
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,536
Let's talk about why

1170
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,816
You guys turned

1171
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
But before you do that

1172
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
I got ahead of myself

1173
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,960
We should talk about what the heck risk V is for anybody out there

1174
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,008
What

1175
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,056
Time taken to know about arm

1176
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
Talk to us about what

1177
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,104
Spiders

1178
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,015
Where in Santo died

1179
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:02,111
Dolese sporty forty years ago in Brooklyn and the same guy

1180
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,415
Who invented that's what years ago

1181
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:09,535
Revisit to the risk architecture

1182
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:19,263
Picture of cross

1183
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:23,103
Yours and came out with what we put on instruction set

1184
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,639
Hockey pictures

1185
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,175
The construction that

1186
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,967
You used to program

1187
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,159
Instead of making

1188
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,719
The decider together with Becca University

1189
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,767
To make it available for free

1190
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
How to take over world

1191
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,703
So they made it available launch Foundation

1192
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,727
Which missions

1193
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,007
How do you make the chicken

1194
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,335
And I must say that

1195
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,615
These four years ago

1196
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,431
This has to momentum engine.

1197
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,015
I'm to be Frank's for years ago when I was teaching

1198
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,319
Mira's five bass processor

1199
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,367
60% of the time I was

1200
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
Pronoun

1201
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,695
Not anymore everybody's list

1202
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,023
Let's go to the idea of

1203
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,327
Why an end consumer should

1204
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,119
So I obviously

1205
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,423
Like oh my gosh nerdout on Newmarket

1206
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,727
Most people are going to think

1207
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,287
Man you know I don't need to know this

1208
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,311
How does this benefit

1209
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,663
Want to get some pool.

1210
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,967
Country music

1211
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,247
Logos of the

1212
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:38,111
Bands that you wear can be a watch or not to watch that Will analyze your movements

1213
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,671
Analyze your biological signal

1214
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,279
Application that is well-known

1215
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,839
You can use iron processor today

1216
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,143
She wants to really analyze those

1217
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,935
And if you have a cheap solution

1218
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:56,031
Today is the only thing that that band will be able to do is analyze your

1219
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
But nothing else

1220
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,359
So if you have the stuff

1221
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,639
DU Battery Life

1222
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,407
Ouija one day

1223
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:04,991
You sure use a processor that use hydro energy

1224
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,831
Battery life we move from one day

1225
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,159
On this has value for the consumer

1226
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,695
That's one example

1227
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,767
Docker example

1228
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,791
More of

1229
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:21,375
Industrial / infrastructure business

1230
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
Smoke consumer

1231
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:27,519
So I can give you an example that receive

1232
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
Richest people accounting

1233
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,127
Sensors in a meeting room

1234
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,919
I'm counting people

1235
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
Every minutes

1236
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,759
For five years or for the duration of the leaves of the building

1237
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,551
It has a lot of value

1238
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:44,671
A company in order to understand how they're building out use interrupt United so you can see

1239
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,743
Alright so now we have an instruction set

1240
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,047
I think what's important here is

1241
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,095
Risc V isn't just

1242
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
For the iot

1243
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,679
As an instruction set why would you use something

1244
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,775
So why would someone choose the least five

1245
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,079
Designer process

1246
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:06,943
You can trust me because there are as many answers company or research T-Mobile

1247
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,247
You should talk to people all over the world

1248
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,295
Primer in China but not only

1249
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,367
People who say well if I receive a respite I don't have to

1250
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
To pay anything to anyone

1251
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,463
Yes or no

1252
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,023
True that it's free so you can use it

1253
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
You have one you have

1254
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,119
Correspondence manual

1255
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,655
And you still have to develop

1256
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,935
The processor.

1257
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
He's able

1258
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,727
Interpret

1259
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,751
Gold instruction

1260
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:37,151
Socio there companies that are a licensee designing but processor cores on license

1261
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,943
Cub Sport

1262
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,759
I am not buying one of those so I don't know how much

1263
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,063
But I would think that you have to

1264
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,111
Play what we put on the wall

1265
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,927
I don't know you so it's a one-time payment

1266
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,999
I done you can use the processor with nothing royalty

1267
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
The cost of your product

1268
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,399
On the other hand you have also a lot of

1269
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,983
This is where it gets interesting

1270
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,031
That's Takis instructions

1271
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,079
And innovate around

1272
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:09,407
In the rocking themselves

1273
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,687
Process of course

1274
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,735
The one that we are using

1275
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,783
He's coming from a project called pulp

1276
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
Ulp

1277
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:22,207
From xinjiang University

1278
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,743
But you look more interesting

1279
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,047
You can read it you know that I can discern that

1280
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:30,911
Enrich

1281
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,215
The sense that we have a.

1282
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:33,983
Instructions

1283
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,079
That's all very well chune for the type of algorism

1284
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,383
That we want to run well on my machine

1285
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,175
Remarkable

1286
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,223
TV Kodi on benchmarks that

1287
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
We have

1288
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:48,319
The number of cycles of the number of instruction that you need

1289
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,671
Full-time lights

1290
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,207
Then watch it would be

1291
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,511
Veggie curry spice processor

1292
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,839
I need to be the same Suite to full-time better

1293
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,887
Done what you could be on an arm processor

1294
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,191
Translate directly

1295
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,495
Almost directly into energy saving

1296
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
Because you have

1297
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,591
List Cycles on 2-cycle is Reggie Watts consume energy

1298
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,871
So do in summer

1299
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,175
People are getting off service 5

1300
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,503
I don't think this is the most interesting

1301
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,623
That's even better if you chant you know that was all the freedom that you

1302
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,415
Annual notes obliging.

1303
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,463
Licensee mobile to East batch

1304
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,487
To the community

1305
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:31,583
You're cool. You can decide to do it or you can keep it to yourself

1306
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,167
Got it so if I wanted to do something like that with arm I would have

1307
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,703
Very expensive art

1308
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,471
Protect your license

1309
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,519
And to differentiate

1310
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,311
I couldn't do it at all with X8

1311
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,639
Yes. What's respite

1312
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
Rock

1313
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:48,223
Use the Lost Community everybody

1314
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,527
Because you could have started

1315
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:57,695
Teriyaki pictures that you would go and license from the usual intellectual property

1316
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,719
Cheap flights from seoul

1317
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,023
The synopsis for the Cadence of the world

1318
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
But she

1319
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,119
You don't benefit from the huge community

1320
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,239
To use an architecture that that's a lost community

1321
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,519
What is that is that

1322
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:16,127
The tools that are used by your last Community are always much better and much

1323
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,919
And they all future-proof

1324
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,711
So that's generally so

1325
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
So people are

1326
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,503
Cheap

1327
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,039
No one ever says no to

1328
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:23,807
Jeffrey

1329
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,623
And then there's the possibility for innovation

1330
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,647
The huge community

1331
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,671
No

1332
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,231
Why are people turning to risc V

1333
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
For iot

1334
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,535
By the way I think

1335
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,655
Most of the application.

1336
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,935
Louis V

1337
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,959
I'll let you know you

1338
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,263
I'm not saying that we are alone

1339
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,103
But the reason is that in most cases today

1340
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,455
R u t means microcontroller processor.

1341
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,759
And microcontroller

1342
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,343
So you don't want to

1343
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,415
Frankly you find watch NGO

1344
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:04,255
It's also for people that are selling Arm based processor

1345
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,303
In a very large number

1346
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,583
It's a very competitive

1347
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,423
Business on you get extremely good pricing from cheap vendors

1348
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,639
Only if you want to innovate so if you want to have architecture

1349
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,687
To do very well symptoms

1350
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:27,551
Okay if you want just to do a me to processor

1351
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:32,159
Keke coutee a microcontroller in iot would cost you anything between

1352
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,695
Gucci 50 Cent

1353
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,303
Saving you a couple of Sons of licensees node

1354
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,607
The same time East Rogers

1355
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,655
You are doing your processor that use

1356
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,263
50 timeline

1357
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
Ganja benefits

1358
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,383
I want to be able to innovate and therefore you have to

1359
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,431
So it's only

1360
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,711
4 power consumption

1361
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,503
He's not for crusty iot

1362
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,295
Sensors based on your processor

1363
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:03,135
Will be more expensive but they will also have a longer battery

1364
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,159
Flight status the trade-offs

1365
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,695
Companies who choose that will make

1366
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,463
Yes

1367
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:08,511
That's to put season in Prospect

1368
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,583
Let's assume that I sell twice as much as

1369
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,143
Michael conforto

1370
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,983
I have one customer that has a radio sensor

1371
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,007
But it has

1372
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,311
Uses 10 battery

1373
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,871
Honey we moved from 10 batteries

1374
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,639
1 battery

1375
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,967
So in that case there is ample room for the

1376
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,759
The customer to reduce his cost

1377
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,599
Sure not just reduce your costs but

1378
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:37,439
You can probably actually reduce the entire size of your board that's your product get smaller

1379
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,207
Yay

1380
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:38,975
As well

1381
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:43,327
So let's talk about complexities here because

1382
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,143
I feel like when we start talking about newsha Park

1383
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,959
People are like they get very excited

1384
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,263
We're like oh my gosh this could change the world

1385
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,287
But then a lot of time

1386
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,823
We don't see adoption

1387
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,127
In this happened you know I remember this

1388
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,687
Saint Cloud Computing I feel like we're kind of at that moment

1389
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:01,247
Where everyone's like oh my God new architectures for AI

1390
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:04,575
So what is it take to have a new architecture

1391
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,111
Adopted by the world

1392
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,135
At Large

1393
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,159
Do you even need that

1394
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:14,815
Broadly in the cop shooting scene there is a new architectural that she's adopted every time you're so

1395
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,095
You're right it's very difficult

1396
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,399
Very difficult and people hate

1397
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,423
Uc's

1398
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,775
Primarily because of what I said before primarily because of the tools

1399
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,543
The tools have

1400
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,823
Expedia

1401
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,871
Because a lot of

1402
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:31,967
People use that and you need something you need a really really strong case

1403
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,039
Greek architecture

1404
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
For those days

1405
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,343
New architecture

1406
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,135
Significant

1407
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:41,439
Today Ambush movie

1408
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,487
20 defunct proposal in the world

1409
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,047
Maybe one maybe

1410
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,631
What would make it the last one I think that made it was gpus

1411
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,679
But you can use all your

1412
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,983
So why would people want

1413
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,543
2 greens Market

1414
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,823
Is when they are

1415
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,847
Fundamentally

1416
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,127
Algorism because

1417
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:00,895
This is what you

1418
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:05,503
Weather in Beijing now

1419
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,903
Performance and increasing income of power consumption

1420
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,463
At some points are given architecture how to sleep

1421
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,023
Dress you can get off as a stopped up we have

1422
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,583
Take you under the council's decision.

1423
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,375
Something you

1424
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,935
No the same

1425
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,519
AI

1426
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,055
Forgetting about iot

1427
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:32,383
We are very much classy guy so we are not

1428
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,919
Trying to reinvent the wheel

1429
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,967
We are statue in the number of

1430
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,991
Architectural

1431
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,039
Very well-known

1432
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,319
The programmer

1433
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,111
We stores

1434
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,415
Building blocks we are making a cheat that

1435
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,255
To avoid that you architecture syndrome adults

1436
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,583
So the underlying RK

1437
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
Conjecture

1438
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,631
The programmers don't actually have

1439
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,399
Have to care about it

1440
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,935
No

1441
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,471
To be French and we just

1442
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,751
Publix

1443
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:02,079
She's almost as if they were using a well-known research process

1444
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,943
Would be respite that don't matter that teaches by using your programming

1445
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,015
We provide them all the tools to hide

1446
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,807
There is some subtlety behind you

1447
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:16,159
Picture but we are hiding for the programmer of the fact that

1448
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,695
Architecture

1449
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,975
It's just like

1450
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,999
Irregular process

1451
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,535
With risk 5

1452
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:26,655
If we have seen some big companies in videos using it actually to design internally

1453
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,935
A Management Corp

1454
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,215
Western Digital

1455
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,007
Which by the way is the sponsor of the

1456
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:31,775
This week show

1457
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,335
Is also using theirs and introduced a

1458
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:38,943
Core for internal use basically these are big

1459
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,503
But they're not really by the way

1460
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,807
And Google's doing it okay

1461
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,159
As a startup is this

1462
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,463
An advantage for you does it matter does it

1463
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,999
Promote respect

1464
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,279
It helps a lot

1465
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:56,095
And I have an outside one of those guys

1466
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,887
Are using the same chords

1467
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:02,495
Ulta beauty supplies that have verification needs

1468
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,287
EPL 2 hours

1469
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,847
Unda verified the same Growers hours

1470
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,871
The song bugs

1471
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,919
Updates

1472
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,159
Just really the value in software you only add

1473
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,207
What differentiate yourself

1474
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,231
But you benefit

1475
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
From the community

1476
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:29,119
That comes from the fact that thousands of people are using the same

1477
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,775
Glass companies adopting RS5 for the

1478
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,079
Gdb embedded

1479
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,895
The Santa Clause I'm not processing

1480
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,943
