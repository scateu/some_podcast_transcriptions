There's also a new place to shop that I'm super excited about here in Austin Texas

12
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:41,984
Where to make some

13
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,776
Some speculation about Spotify

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312

Smart kitchens and

18
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,880
When you will be able to buy one

19
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648
Some of y'all

20
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
Hard Luck

21
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,696
First

22
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,488
Speaking of smart kitchens

23
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,888
The smart Kitchen Summit is the only event of its kind to tackle the future of food cooking and the kitchen

24

27
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
Food

28
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
You got to spell it right guys Stacey for a 25% discount on tickets at WWE

29
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,096
W. Smart Kitchen Summit. Com

30
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
All right

31
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,264
The timing of today's podcast is interesting

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
Because in about

33
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,920
4 hours after we recorded this Google IO kicks off with a keynote witch

34
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,272
Kind of leads me to my typical disclosure that I do work for Google as a consultant

35
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,416
In their Enterprise area for devices not coyote or anything like that so all opinions are my own

36
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,072
So we know something because Google just announced some things but we know Google's kind of probably enough some more things

37
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,864
And Kevin doesn't actually know those

38
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,192
So he can't give us a sneak peek knowing that tomorrow this would

39
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,032
You guys are just going to have to get a slightly

40
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
Steel pot

41
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,480
We ask Google to push everything up a day but they didn't listen

42
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
I don't I don't have any pull there

43
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
You know

44
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
Kevin

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,368
Slacker

46
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
Call Cinderella

47
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
Make it so

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,584
Let's get started with Google launching a beta version of

49
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,216
An iot Cloud platform is part of its cloud computing efforts a private beta

50
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
Private beta

51
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,544
Which is like extra beta

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Not quite Alpha but it's almost

53
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
So this is Google Cloud iot

54
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,016
So when I'm looking at a new iot Cloud platform I look for

55
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
I look for the ability to

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Vision

57
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,880
Ingest data

58
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
Device management

59
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
And

60
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
Probably some other things that I'm not thinking about

61
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
Like I said Daddy Analytics

62
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,816
Open firmware

63
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Thank you

64
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,400
Yeah which this has some of those

65
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,448
It definitely has firmware updates

66
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:25,568
At least for Android things devices Google says the firmware updates can be automatic

67
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,896
I don't know much about the provisioning side for four other

68
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Devices

69
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,760
But certainly the analytics are there I mean this ties into

70
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:38,880
Google Cloud platform bigtable bigquery even their Cloud machine learning aspects

71
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,928
So there's there's some

72
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:46,560
I think that would explain why it's still in private beta and they've also got a lot of device partners

73
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
So it's impossible

74
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,400
Certain modules you buy from this device partners

75
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,704
Are going to be able to be managed in

76
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:58,592
That's very similar AWS has something like that and they work with lots of other

77
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,456
Nxp arm until other companies to pull device in producer

78
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,576
And it's mostly the same players hear minutes is clearly an attempt to

79
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
Show developers hey you know you don't have to go AWS if you don't want to you if you want to take advantage of Google Cloud platform in

80
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
All the service is there

81
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
Come on over here

82
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,839
Yeah and honestly

83
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,655
Google it's not a huge player in the

84
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
Industrial or the

85
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
Even manufacturers

86
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
Consumer devices

87
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,103
And this actually doesn't change anything because this is such a limit

88
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Beta

89
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Right now

90
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
AWS is by far and away

91
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
According to Lexi

92
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
Eclipse developer survey

93
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
I think it's 40 something

94
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
10% of 12

95
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,879
Followed by Azure which is got

96
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
26

97
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:49,023
Yeah I was just I was just going to say Microsoft has a strong number two there and and Google's trying to catch up

98
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
So this makes sense

99
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
But

100
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
It is good that Google's doing

101
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
She needs to do

102
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:01,823
Looks like they have support for mqtt I'm not seeing support for like a MP

103
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
Did you or AMT

104
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,687
Can never remember

105
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,503
But mqtt is a Communications protocol data

106
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
So

107
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,879
This is good it needs to happen so that's all I can say about it right now

108
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
My Hope

109
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
And I don't know

110
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,023
But my hope is that at I owe more information comes out or even some

111
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,375
Additional features support Etc because

112
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,215
It was interesting to me that this blog post on Google Cloud blog

113
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,031
Will publish the day before I outright

114
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
It's not like this is

115
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
Ayo news

116
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,407
If it was when I hold the fry alright semana

117
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
Kind of hoping there's some follow-up

118
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Information

119
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Me too

120
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,551
Also in the Google Sphere

121
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,599
The Google verse I don't know what to call it

122
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:51,999
Google sings we're in there going to talk about this because there's a developer session but they did the Android things

123
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
Preview for

124
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
And basically

125
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
We see it works with iot

126
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,679
Cloud we also know that there is newborn support

127
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
For some new stuff from NXT

128
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
They got a lot of voice

129
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,407
Which is a good follow-up from earlier this month

130
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:14,015
Magpi magazine folks like to use raspberry pies that community

131
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
There was a do-it-yourself

132
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,367
Google Assistant kit

133
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,207
In there you had to add your own pie to it but there's a cardboard kitten

134
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:27,839
And add on boards and so on and you can download software and basic build your own little

135
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
Google assistant device through it

136
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
So that's where I

137
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,727
I think the first real voice kit

138
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,287
Aspect came into play so it's a follow-up to that

139
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
Yes with dp4

140
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,735
The necessary drivers are provided to support the Google Assistant SDK on all Android things certified development

141
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Right

142
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
So now we can

143
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Oh

144
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,903
So this is really good because it's saying that Google's like hey you know what we're going to talk to her thanks

145
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,719
Which we kind of knew

146
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,023
We've been saying that for years

147
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
I wish we would hear a little bit more about

148
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
Weave

149
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
At

150
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,287
Epi staying at Google IO

151
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,615
Weed is their Communications device Discovery protocol

152
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
You know they talk to sup

153
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
It competes with the

154
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,831
Iotivity standard that isn't really designed actually for small things yet

155
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
And there's a lot of

156
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
Play happening here but maybe

157
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
Google's like you know what

158
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,999
The standard thing is not work it out let's just forget about it

159
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,535
I don't I don't know

160
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
So

161
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
I don't know I mean that home messaging has been kind of

162
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,519
Murky for the better part of at least two years I did see in the developer preview news of a side in a will

163
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
We talk more about this

164
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,383
And they pay the live stream link so anybody can TuneIn

165
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
My Hope Is that we do hear more

166
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,807
Is it the last couple years maybe we just been throwing we even berlo and Android things around

167
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
And now Brillo is

168
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
Right

169
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Right

170
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
So

171
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
We need some clarity

172
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
We would love some

173
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,791
I bet I bet inside sometimes I feel like the

174
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
No comment

175
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,823
It's all good it's all good

176
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
Okay speaking of clouds

177
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,407
A lot of clouds in this week's podcast

178
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
Ultiworld is happening in California as well this week and Samsung did some Jews related to its

179
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Arctic

180
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Iot platform

181
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,439
An artic is both a cloud platform

182
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,279
But it's also a series of modules that Samsung has built

183
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,839
It is

184
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,935
Super Chinese super Harden's relatively cheap and it's designed for

185
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:44,287
Medical devices connected home appliances Building Products

186
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
So

187
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:50,687
This has a bunch of videos that has chips it has pretty much everything you need to just pop it in and

188
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Build something

189
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,319
And then Samsung artik is also in there clouds outside

190
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
Which

191
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,903
Arctic is famous for having all these clouds

192
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Connectors where you

193
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
You can

194
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
Print services like I could blink my

195
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,791
Washing machine to my

196
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,839
Google home for example

197
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Through

198
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,191
He hasn't link to Google Assistant basically I think you're foreshadowing there

199
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
I might be

200
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
Anyway so

201
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
Oh that's why

202
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,431
I know I know I read the notes I saw the guest

203
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
Podcast

204
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
You guys this

205
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
Just all over

206
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
So big before we leave this

207
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Arctic dead

208
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,159
I also saw that Samsung's work with VMware

209
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,463
On their partner program with our take

210
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,047
Add VMware has VMware pulse iot Center

211
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,655
Which is basically a control panel to get information and visibility to the health of

212
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,703
You are iot devices so

213
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,263
Rather smart of them to two

214
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,079
If I can't deal with themselves rather smart of Samsung

215
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
Apartment with somebody who can

216
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
Help manage

217
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
These devices and make sure they're all on the up-and-up

218
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Right so you can

219
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
Connect all kinds of things to that

220
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
Iot

221
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Stop pulse iot Center

222
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
All right

223
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,743
You know we should have made today a drinking game so every time we said iot cloud or iot we should

224
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,095
I would have swapped my coffee out LOL

225
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Arctic

226
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,727
Right in two

227
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
The Amazon

228
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
Echo

229
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
So much stuff

230
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
All right

231
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,199
Let's just get the first big news exciting thing out of the way

232
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Money

233
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
Amazon

234
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Developers

235
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
The skill developer Sia

236
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
Guess

237
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,695
And this is something I actually thought about I wrote about it when I

238
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Fortune

239
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
Over a year ago saying

240
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,327
Hey is this going to really be an App Store Willow

241
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,143
Amazon let it let developers monetize

242
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
Madam a

243
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,591
It's kind of just getting started though I don't

244
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,455
People get all excited their penis is kind of limited it's only game skills at first

245
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
So

246
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
Yes cuz Amazon

247
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Has actually

248
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,951
I remember where I saw this if it was in the letter to shareholders or it was in a conference somewhere but Amazon said it was really beef

249
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
Picking up its game

250
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,327
Efforts so smart home Focus was last year and now it really wants to have

251
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
So

252
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
That makes sense

253
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
Pay game makers to build

254
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
It's kind of an interesting place to start they must be because those are very popular but has been scratching my head like I never

255
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
Never once

256
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,479
Play keno play like a quiz game or any other

257
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
Game return Echo

258
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,647
Barbie no no I mean I totally get it I'm not going to try to disable I get it but

259
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
I can't

260
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,767
Imagine it's that popular it must be you know I'm an outlier I don't have to say

261
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,583
Well I don't think on the echo that you are an outlier

262
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
That's what I say

263
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
Amazon's really hoping

264
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
We find the next big

265
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
The next style of Gaming

266
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,335
That's like me sitting around playing

267
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,431
Chess with my kids but only I voice control the board by telling my kids what move to me

268
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
I just don't get it

269
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
Maybe we're not the right I mean

270
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
Play song

271
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Yeah it me up

272
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Someone who's older

273
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
Cher

274
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
Airport that that's me pretty soon.

275
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
All right

276
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,375
Apparently

277
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
With Madeline

278
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,775
Alright other exciting news especially for us

279
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Consumerism

280
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
People who have

281
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Echoes every

282
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
There

283
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
Doing a program

284
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
For allowing notify

285
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Vacations

286
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,831
Amazon is announcing notifications for Madame a coming soon

287
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
Right now you just sign up

288
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
Basically this is going to

289
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,999
Not just in this is something I saw that the Google home and I was like

290
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,095
So basically you're going around your day

291
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
I think about all the times that like

292
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,447
Google Now or something pings you in his life

293
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,519
China leave

294
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,567
So those are the things so

295
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
It's going to enable notifications for

296
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,687
Select skills and shopping updates

297
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
On most devices with

298
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,015
Seoul AccuWeather

299
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,575
Life360 which is a really great

300
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,623
Program for tracking your family members

301
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,439
Those are going to be the first update their skills with

302
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Vacation

303
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
The Washington Post

304
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Just eat

305
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,399
Yeah it's interesting cuz the Echoes have pretty much been very passive devices

306
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,983
Up until now although just last week we saw the first

307
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
Alipay active

308
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
Data where the echo actually

309
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,127
Tells you something without your asking it

310
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
And that was

311
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
The calling

312
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
Yes

313
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,039
Right and I wouldn't call that notification but you could see where they're going with it's now it's going to

314
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Tempstar

315
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,391
You're reaching out to you when something happens and that's definitely needed

316
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,463
Yes and all the skills will require users to opt-in

317
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
And you can

318
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
You can disable notifications for skills

319
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:00,447
Or suppress notifications temporarily by putting devices in Do Not Disturb mode

320
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
By voice

321
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
Or through the Echo app which is good

322
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,359
Good good good yes last week

323
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Echo Show

324
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
And

325
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,223
A little bit later that afternoon after work

326
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
For the show

327
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Kevin says I spam

328
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
The feature and I was on this week

329
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
Google so

330
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
Call

331
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,559
Live on the air she called me

332
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,959
Oh yeah I was sitting here at my home office instead of a sudden

333
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,519
Little. That I have in here lights up green and says

334
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
Collarspace

335
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,151
And I tried to answer it and fortunately didn't work I don't know why

336
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,991
I think I was just taken aback and I didn't say the right to man so I called you back on the air

337
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
But the point here is

338
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,623
It's just like having a landline phone again

339
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Yeah

340
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,207
And I actually I was really in trouble

341
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,023
Kevin you don't know that the angst inside of me

342
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,655
Yeah I tweeted that they see to spam called me

343
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,959
On the Amazon Echo and iPad

344
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,495
Night and day I didn't mind at all

345
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,543
I'm sorry

346
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
I thought it was funny

347
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
I did too

348
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,967
Everybody who liked my tweet where I said I was a jerk

349
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
Impressed with you

350
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,551
My response was

351
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
Well I am a jerk

352
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
I got so many likes

353
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
So all of you

354
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Now I'm shaking my head at you

355
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
Brady

356
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,191
This notification but actually plays into another one of our topics and that is Amazon has a new

357
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
TV out

358
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
Amazon TV

359
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,359
4K are they safe 4K and it's low price

360
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663
I mean I'm an HD guy from

361
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,503
Back before we had HD it does have 4K UHD but no HDR

362
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,551
High dynamic range says whatever

363
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,343
But more importantly

364
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,671
It has basically has the Amazon Fire

365
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:01,535
Interface just built in the software feels right and so you don't need a Fire TV stick or a box

366
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
And of course with that

367
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Comes

368
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
Your assistant

369
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,679
And I was just thinking about this like if I'm watching TV

370
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,799
I don't want an echo notification on my TV you know popping up

371
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Oh really

372
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,151
Cuz that's one of the things is like somewhere in the corner

373
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,711
People's homes like

374
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:24,319
AT&T used to have it I'm sure Comcast had it where you could get caller ID on your television

375
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
And I shut it off

376
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,743
I went on Netflix and don't mess with me okay that's me time

377
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
You like what I maven

378
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
Yeah

379
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,655
No no I'm watching Bosch back off caller

380
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Well that's what you're not

381
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:48,383
True true for folks who don't have an echo again this is another way for Amazon the propagate this whole service into

382
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
Smart Home

383
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,455
Atticus's TV start for 99

384
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
That's for the

385
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Damn

386
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Not

387
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,767
The only downside to me I pray

388
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,559
After plugging a box

389
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
Into

390
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,935
TV because I'd rather buy a TV with the highest picture quality and so on so forth

391
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,239
And I don't want to be locked into the

392
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
Smart

393
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,103
Hardware that's built-in for Reno that put chip processor and so on

394
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,407
Building for the interface in the software

395
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
You want to dump

396
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
Yeah

397
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:29,343
Yeah so that's what I bought I have a dumb awesome 4K screen and I plug in

398
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,183
Well either an Amazon Fire TV or Nvidia Shield TV so yeah

399
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
Okay so there is an

400
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,119
I don't want I mean what happens when Amazon gets real pistol

401
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,655
Google and they stop

402
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
YouTube and

403
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,519
I would hope that doesn't happen for any of the

404
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,335
People who are content providers and such yeah

405
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Let's see

406
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,151
Other

407
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,479
Other news bets

408
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
Which

409
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,319
I know we've had them on the show as a guest but Honeywell his

410
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,135
Created a hundred million dollar Venture Capital firm

411
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,279
The focus here is on anything that will help it scale its businesses

412
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,887
The reason we mention it here is because they are really big in the industrial internet-of-things

413
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Already offering

414
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,519
Things as a service to customers and they

415
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,335
They also make consumer devices but

416
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,895
I don't know if this Venture fund really focuses on the

417
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
Consumer side

418
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
It looks more Industrial

419
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
The point here

420
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,391
New Venture Capital arm so if you are trying to sell people on

421
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,975
HVAC stuff building management

422
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
Industrial processes

423
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,327
Iggy Pop on over to Honeywell

424
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
And see what they got

425
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Okay

426
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Other news

427
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
We talked about this in the past

428
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
Spotify

429
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,311
There were Rumours a while back but it might build his own

430
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,591
Hardware device

431
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,127
And Kevin was like

432
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
Rewind a minute

433
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
I

434
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,527
Spotify customer just got a survey

435
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,575
And they ask me all these questions about me

436
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
My physical fitness

437
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,927
Am I crazy about my physical fitness or not

438
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,511
And what I like to listen to music and all this other great stuff

439
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:18,143
So my fingers are crossed that maybe they're going to make a wearable that's truly wearable and not just a controller

440
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,191
We're not just attached to my smartphone

441
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
Where will I'm exercising

442
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
So I was

443
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Kind of

444
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:30,431
Down on this idea when it was first announced they were thinking about entering the wearable Market

445
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,991
I'm even more so now and I'll tell you why

446
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,063
I actually just bought a new wearable although it's

447
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,135
Technically an old one if it came out last year almost a year ago

448
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Ibotta

449
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,975
Yeah I bought and I bought this a year ago in fact

450
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,559
Last year I bought a Samsung Gear Fit

451
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:51,167
2 and one of the big things that had just how does having is it's got Spotify

452
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
When I bought it

453
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
Only to find out it's Justice

454
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
Spotify

455
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:01,151
The app that control Spotify on your phone so you still need to carry your phone when you work out

456
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,967
Which is kind of silly cuz this thing can store music

457
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,991
There are still

458
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,039
Tons and tons of foreign post

459
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,319
People complaining about this thing

460
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,671
So I ended up returning it the year ago

461
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:17,279
Technically because it didn't integrate with RunKeeper which is what I use for my book of record for exercising

462
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,327
It now does and I found a refurbished

463
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
Unit

464
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,167
Probably the same one that returned a year ago for $85 so I bought it

465
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
It's working great

466
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,751
Spotify still is the same as just a controller

467
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,055
Here's my point long story short

468
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:35,711
Play Spotify comes out with its own Hardware wearable device that allows offline music player

469
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:41,855
What happens to all these other wearables that either work with Spotify in a limited fashion or what

470
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:46,975
They're probably never going to have offline playback capability and I just think that's terrible

471
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,279
Oh-so Spotify with key

472
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Keep offline play

473
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
Prince self

474
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
Bada Bing

475
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Mancan

476
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,215
So that was that was why I was so interested in the

477
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Pebble

478
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
Or I think it's what it was called

479
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Cancel that

480
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
Right right

481
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
I'm sitting here a lot of

482
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,271
There a lot of Spotify smartwatch

483
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:16,928
Apps that you can put Spotify on your watch or whatever and these watches cab storage can store

484
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:22,048
Play music so you can go exercising listen which is what I always do when I go out and run I always listen to music

485
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,608
But I think Spotify with the hold that back

486
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,168
If I were them

487
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,472
What is a consumer on like

488
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
I'm at

489
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
But you'll be happy

490
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
Alrighty

491
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
And final bit of news

492
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,296
This is for people who live in Austin

493
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
This is me

494
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,672
I'll just be honest

495
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,512
Bata store so we've talked about them before this is a

496
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:57,888
Can super store where you can try all kinds of connected devices not just connected home stuff but

497
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,544
Actually you can try Innovative products cuz I actually saw pillow in the Austin store that had no connectivity whatsoever it was just a cool fact

498
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
That stay cool

499
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,152
But you can try out virtual reality headsets

500
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,688
Ride on bikes UK

501
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
Listen to speakers

502
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
So

503
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:17,088
They're opening a store in Austin if you're in Austin it's in the domain

504
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
Area

505
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:21,184
If you're not in Austin they also stores in Seattle Santa Monica

506
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,488
And Palo Alto Alto

507
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,560
Going to have one in San Francisco but that is tdd

508
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,840
When that happen

509
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,448
Yeah I went in I got to see lots of devices

510
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,496
Quite frankly I'm very worried that I

511
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Near me

512
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:42,176
When I go out to Google and I just haven't had the time but I plan on going out there

513
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,392
I know there's some really great stuff

514
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
That's kind of the fun part

515
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
Yay

516
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,816
And know I feel like we talked about a lot really quickly

517
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
But

518
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,376
We got our guest still to come

519
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:05,216
And we're going to have a word from our sponsor Arris

520
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,776
This week's guest is actually Bill Gardner

521
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,312
From GE Appliances

522
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
And this week

523
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,664
Geappliances said all of its

524
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,480
Connected appliances will now work with the Google

00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
Home

526
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,552
And that closes the foreshadowing live for today

527
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
I was so I had no idea

528
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
So

529
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:31,840
Bill is not going to talk about that but he is going to talk about the future of smart kitchens what people do with their appliances

530
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
Has an echo

531
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,424

532
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,752
Who is the smartest assistant that works with both

533
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,312
The Google home now and the Amazon Echo

Both within the US and internationally

550
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,784
Data centers and storage and analytics systems that

551
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,392
Take appropriate action on the data that is being gathered and then I can also provide the most

552
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,440
All the devices that are out now

553
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,792
That's a big job one of the biggest aspects of that has connectivity

554
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,352
What are the options out there for the internet

555
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:43,264
That's a very good question Stacey I think it depends very strongly on the requirements of the application

556
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,664
In truly mobile or physically mobile application cellular is a natural choice because it provides

557
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,064
The capability of using a network transport that's available everywhere that people are or that people will send their iot device

558
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
Asus2

559
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:01,184
If the device is located within a residence or a business there other options

560
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Clearly

561
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,256
You can have wifi-connected devices

562
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,584
It's a short-range device that communicates with a cell phone

563
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,632
Bratz use Bluetooth or zigbee

564
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,704
Options exist and of course there are some Next Generation

565
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:18,592
Low-power wide area networks that are being deployed within the United States and overseas that can provide

566
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
Lower cost

567
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,456
Short-range and long-range and medium to long-range connectivity

568
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,248
For these kinds of application

569
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:31,648
The choices depend very heavily on what the applications requirement for what they cost model for

570
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,488
The services that they're providing can be etc etc

571
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,632
Every one of these connectivity options has pros and cons and the decision for which one could use is something that we can help guide

572
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,192
There's an estimate that about 30%

573
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,800
29 to 30% of the devices being deployed for M2M iot applications

574
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:54,176
By 2025 will be the cellular or some form of low-power wide area network

575
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
What are my options

576
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,504
For us or global

577
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,856
Are you deployed it application within the us or internationally

578
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,952
It was generally deployed I cellular application of course radio modules

579
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,744
Cellular Arabic more expensive

580
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,304
Then other Technologies on the other hand

581
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:16,960
Cellular is available pretty much anywhere around the world you may have to compensate for the frequency difference isn't technology differences that may

582
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,496
Craigslist in other parts of the world

583
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:22,080
That's relatively easy to do we have that information and depending on the

584
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:26,944
The requirements for the iot application has or do the transport you will make choices

585
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,992
I make decisions about betrayal

586
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,064
NZ where can I go to find out more

587
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,720
Let's refer people to the e-book that I have publishes available freely on our website www.arris.com

588
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:45,376
And the our podcast is also available at the same site www.eros.com podcast

589
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,776
Hey everyone welcome back to the intern

590
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:56,896
Turn out of things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Bill Gardner

591
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,944
Who is manager of connected

592
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
Partnerships

593
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
A GE Appliances

594
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
I didn't great steaks

595
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
Neon

596
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,648
Man I'm super excited about this

597
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,976
Because because I have many appliances

598
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:15,584
But this is a place where I'm like connectivity could make my life really awesome

599
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,376
But it's also a place where am I

600
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,936
Are we even going to get to this point

601
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:24,288
Hopefully this conversation you're going to buy all new

602
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,080
Muji appliances here to be so excited

603
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:31,200
Oh that's a tall order my friend I just bought a house built in 2012

604
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
I have Wi-Fi

605
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
They're still really good

606
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,552
CC

607
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,088
You can do this by faith

608
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,696
So let's get started with what is GE Appliances

609
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
Doing here

610
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Cuz I

611
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,024
I've written about like

612
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,072
Some effort you guys had way back with

613
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:53,472
Wink 2 characters retrofit

614
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
You guys so

615
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
What is the overall strategy

616
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,104
Connect to this really important Uchi appliances

617
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,664
The ability to deliver firmware updates

618
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
Appliance connected

619
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,880
A really exciting thing to sell people

620
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,928
I do not buy the appliance

621
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,000
Day one thinking

622
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,024
Pine-Sol

623
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,328
Some years down the road I can get a service update

624
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,864
How to say you better

625
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
A trip to my house

626
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,496
Partnerships with value-added

627
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,544
Tires in in the smart home field

628
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
And

629
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,408
Creno's use cases are making people want to connect

630
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,712
I will talk about several of them today but

631
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
Did you give the person

632
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,296
The real value their

633
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,600
And make that extra step to get that plants connected

634
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:46,464
Which is really good for them the long-term and short-term as well cuz it may get there really nice shoes case

635
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,256
The how to solve their everyday

636
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,096
And it's really good for you guys because there's a

637
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
There's a huge benefit

638
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,400
Set for y'all to see how the

639
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
The appliances

640
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
Performing in the feet

641
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
Oso

642
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,496
We have tons

643
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,312
Identify a problem

644
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,128
An appliance and maybe even a person doesn't need to know about

645
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
Contact a consumer

646
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,480
Consumer

647
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,040
I left another appliances in performing optimally

648
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:15,904
Talk to them send a service tech or pushing update to really build a relationship with consumer

649
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,976
Inn of the appliances that

650
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:22,048
You guys have out there is your whole line connected now

651
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
Disconnected you have the refrigerator

652
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,424
Dishwasher

653
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,216
The wall of in the rain

654
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,008
The washer the dryer

655
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
Window air conditioner

656
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,824
You don't have microwave yet

657
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
You don't have art

658
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Handsome yet

659
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,944
The full product line for the most part is connected

660
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,272
So how long ago did you guys start at 8

661
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,368
Really in mass that starting around 2014

662
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,928
Where you started to see appliances Roloff in

663
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,976
Significant numbers off the production line

664
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,560
Jaguar Wi-Fi capable last year we had 70s

665
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,608
Use connected this year they'll be

666
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,912
Over a hundred when it's all said and done this year

667
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,216
Alright so since you guys have been doing this for

668
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,080
Do consumers care about Wi-Fi

669
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
Is an appliance

670
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
And

671
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,712
Once they bought it an appliance with Wi-Fi do they bother to

672
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,760
That's a great question

673
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,040
Unless you can imagine

674
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,344
It's not if they're not strongly connected

675
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
You'll find a lot of iot

676
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,648
Devices in the home

677
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,464
Light switches garage door opener

678
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,792
Because those have that everyday up and down on off

679
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,632
These cases for appliances the home a little more complicated so people don't

680
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,680
Intuitively always see

681
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
The reason to connect.

682
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,288
But you're starting to see more and more of these Partnerships which is

683
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
Really driving

684
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Does integration to have

685
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,736
We can specifically talk about one that's really been an explosion in the spaces when the echo came online

686
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,528
What's that keeps building you don't have to

687
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
People hands

688
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,576
Free in the kitchen

689
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,880
There's always a Time

690
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
In the kitchen

691
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,000
When you could use one or two or three more hands to complete your action right

692
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,584
They're full of bacteria from your chicken that you're preparing their dirty

693
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,632
Cookie dough you may have a child

694
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,656
At your leg like

695
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
Find a cook

696
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,960
All those things

697
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:10,080
Right really restrict what you can do you have to use your that old elbow trick where you kind of

698
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:10,848
Kiddo

699
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,920
At the water faucet to turn it on to wash your hands to go

700
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
Touch your oven

701
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,992
Now that that boys experience

702
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,040
Annex connected Wi-Fi Appliance

703
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
Now

704
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,392
I'm really starting to see the value in the home is how do I fi

705
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,696
Capabilities really tries diet

706
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
My everyday life

707
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
Munchkin

708
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
By far our most

709
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,656
Common function through voice control is preheating out that people come down

710
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:39,520
They get ready to get into the refrigerator to get out their meat or the protein rather going to fix

711
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,056
Nhsa

712
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,104
Geneva preheat the oven to 350

713
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,896
Uso Geneva is your

714
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,712
Assistant coach Geneva is actually Amazon

715
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:52,064
Skilled so you can activate that skill connect your TV connect Appliance to that skill

716
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:56,160
And then you can talk to Geneva and she can control all of our connected points

717
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:01,280
Got it okay I was like who is this Geneva woman and where is she what is she doing in my kitchen

718
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:05,120
Designs by as originally had

719
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:10,240
Gel for the oven the skill for the refrigerator

720
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,056
Appliances would want to talk to each other

721
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,872
And have you remember which one to talk to

722
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,968
Would be a pain point for the consumer so we just a always talk to Geneva

723
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,808
She is the broker of all that information and she'll get the information to the right of plane

724
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,880
I like that yeah that's definitely an issue that

725
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,696
I think we're going to see a lot more of his voice control mousse places

726
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,744
Cuz I do not want to think

727
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:37,376
Oh I'm trying to text my ex Geneva

728
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
And I want to know

729
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,472
Text someone so now I'm going to ask Google

730
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,520
And it's okay

731
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:47,616
So you guys are working with Partners to give people a reason to connect

732
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,896
Beyond just the

733
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,920
Cool stuff that can do for

734
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
And I will say every

735
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
I don't have a GE fridge

736
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
Have a Samsung fridge

737
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
But

738
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
Couple weeks ago

739
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,136
It started making this weird funky noise

740
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:03,744
And we were like what is happening and I wanted a connected fridge more than anything in the

741
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,048
The world at that moment so I could just be like

742
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:06,816
Hey

743
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,864
Samsung take a virtual look at my fridge

744
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
Tell me what's wrong so we can just fix

745
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,752
And it said I had to call a little refrigerator app

746
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
Do something

747
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
Antipsychotics exactly

748
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,128
That's what you were trying to

749
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,712
Kataka right there if we give you a recent connect that refrigerator

750
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
At the time of purchase

751
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
When a problem occurs

752
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,552
There's a good chance at night

753
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:32,928
Are you identified or when that check comes to your house we can guarantee in the first time they come there

754
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,720
It doesn't have the right parts on there

755
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,512
Trusted to deliver you

756
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,816
I fixed Appliance

757
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
I know

758
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,680
So you guys do want connected Appliance

759
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,496
For the one possibly two or never X

760
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
Set this thing might break

761
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,872
So that's the reason I connect the second reason to connect is probably cool things like voice control

762
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,944
Let's talk about intelligence so when you connect

763
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,784
Do this for awhile so a while back

764
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,064
1224

765
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,344
Are 2013

766
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:07,232
People were like so we can remotely control it

767
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
For example for my smartphone

768
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:13,120
For most people it didn't feel like a good enough reason to spend the extra dollars for

769
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,704
But now what I'm seeing is things like

770
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,520
My favorite device the June oven

771
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,056
Which is a

772
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:25,152
Oven is connected but the connectivity is sideline for the fact that it's

773
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
Smart it has

774
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,272
Your sensors in the feet that way the food it's got

775
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,576
Preprogrammed recipes in it

776
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
Just

777
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:37,952
You know I istick basically a piece of fish in there and it's like hey is the same and I'm like yes

778
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
It's like you want it

779
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,000
Well done

780
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,024
And I'm like

781
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
Yes

782
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
Isn't it just

783
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
Does it

784
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,888
And that to me is like where we should be heading

785
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,168
Supposed to like

786
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
Can control it for me

787
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,008
So what are your thoughts where are you guys

788
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,336
I couldn't agree with you more so I think that is

789
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,384
Exactly where you want to go

790
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,200
Caribou some of that difficulty of controlling

791
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:03,040
The appliance since we make appliances we also know how to control it

792
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,832
Better than a lot of consumers do

793
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,160
But to get used to using a certain example so

794
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:13,024
Your oven has a lot of modes a lot of people don't know when to use convection when to not use convection

795
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,048
If you tell us

796
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,840
You're making food X

797
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:22,496
Rights that we can intelligently go through in and recommend emotes you can always override it maybe you're a better Chef than we are Maybe

798
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,288
You got a specialty technique you want to use

799
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
Of what the best notes

800
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,200
And that teacher you saw actually going back to boys

801
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,736
Came into this

802
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:37,344
What is the most popular thing people are doing

803
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,904
So what did you see us do be rolled in a lot of precepts

804
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,928
So now you can say

805
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,952
I want cookies

806
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,768
I want pizza I want chicken nuggets I want lasagna

807
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,328
All those things come through now we say

808
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
Hey

809
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:52,960
This is Geneva we would we recommend putting your husband with convection baked at 350

810
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:57,312
At sets at there so the user doesn't have necessary notes this is great

811
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,336
Teenagers

812
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:03,200
Aspiring cook stats that don't quite know all the fancy features maybe they're having to do

813
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,016
Tell us the food that you want to cook and we're going to recommend emotes

814
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:11,392
And that's great because the control panel can't have a mode on it for every possible food combination

815
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:17,280
But he can't let that boy is not connected experience has no inattentive what you're trying to do which is cook that food

816
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,864
Now we can deliver specialty mode to you so you'll see overtime

817
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,448
Athletic tons of new specialty modes to the users to that interface

818
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,776
That's great so do I end up saying something Lake Geneva

819
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,592
Preheat the oven for cookies or is it more like

820
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
Initiate a conversation

821
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
And Geneva's like

822
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
You want to cook

823
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
So right now it's

824
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,760
You're giving her that preset please say Geneva

825
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,552
I'll be able to preheat for cookies

826
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:45,952
That's where we are right now but as we go you're going to find these conversational systems to be more open-ended to really kind of

827
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
Get it what you want

828
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,280
I love it okay this is very smart

829
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,328
So let's think about

830
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,632
Since we're in the kitchen let's stay in the kitchen we won't

831
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:58,752
We will head to the laundry room just yet what do you think of when we talk about a smart

832
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Kitchen

833
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,800
I'm curious like

834
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
In 3 to 5 years

835
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:07,968
What is my cooking or my kitchen experience going to be like in the GE appliance world

836
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,528
I really think it's the assisted cooking

837
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,856
It's going to really I revolutionized the kitchen

838
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,160
Is it's going to be the recipe app

839
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
Interacting

840
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
The appliance

841
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
2

842
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,792
Take over once you've done the basic

843
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
Brace

844
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:26,144
It's going to know that you need to set temperature eggs for 30 minutes

845
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,704
And then boil for the last minute

846
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,752
Or you going to see exciting things on it

847
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,872
Going to hold 375 for 5 minutes and then automatically turn it down

848
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
The recipe for

849
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,688
2:30 explicit directions

850
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,480
To the Appliance

851
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,760
I think that's really big

852
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
Siding parts

853
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,832
It's going up a lot of people's cookie

854
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,856
Kitchen

855
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,392
That is exciting in

856
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,696
I've been excited about this for a long time

857
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,024
And I think one of the key elements that we don't talk about

858
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,584
What is the concept of how do we digitize

859
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,680
Recipes in have computers understand what food is being cooked

860
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
And you guys

861
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,800
So it's one thing for me to tell the oven hey I'm making

862
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,824
Cookies

863
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,128
Four examples and it to figure

864
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,456
Out what I need to do from there in the case of that unit uses

865
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
Pictures

866
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,016
Video image

867
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
You have a relationship

868
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,856
Trap is really fundamentally

869
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,880
Remaking dresses

870
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,672
So I'm curious like

871
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,952
How you guys see

872
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,512
Digital recipezaar instructions

873
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
How that's going to cut of my grade

874
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
Into the kitchen

875
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
Partner

876
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,704
Stop static create user experience

877
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:39,360
And they're really taking that recipe to the next level by minimizing the number of bowls that a person needs to use for

878
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,384
Pear recipe

879
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,944
By making sure their step by step by doing

880
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,552
Unit conversions if you don't have enough milk or you don't have enough of the greedy day

881
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,088
Sizing recipe so you can

882
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
Make it perfectly

883
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,648
What's what you do have

884
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,464
That's really great siding and then you tie that into the oven

885
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:59,840
So it knows exactly when the preheat and knows exactly the temperature in set the timers and everything comes out

886
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
Coordinate at the end

887
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,424
It was really a very exciting partnership

888
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
I think you're going to see

889
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,520
Many more of those types of Partnerships

890
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,336
With our connect appliances over the next coming years

891
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,896
So we got this vision is like assisted cook

892
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,968
What else needs to come together to make that a reality

893
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
We have

894
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,016
The connected Appliance

895
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,808
Switch digital recipes

896
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,856
What else might we need

897
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,904
So that's a great question

898
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,208
So one thing that I think is

899
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,024
Overlook sometimes is knowing what's in the pants

900
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
So you have that

901
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,424
Really have that Inventory management kind of Concepts a really connect everything so that the recipe

902
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,472
Is recommending recipes

903
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,008
The Grinch you have on him

904
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,568
No use giving you recipes that you

905
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:45,408
Have to go to specialty store to get ingredient for you don't have on hand

906
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:49,248
I think another important thing is people are very health conscious

907
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
So being able to

908
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:56,672
Know that I have stole some lose weight or lower my cholesterol or have better heart health

909
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,464
Constraint that is part of

910
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,232
My recipes

911
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,536
And then I think you're going to continue C

912
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
The appliances

913
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
The Livermore

914
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
Sensors

915
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,144
Four different types

916
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,216
The things since the food is done this sir

917
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,032
Content level different types of elements

918
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,824
Did occur during cooking

919
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,872
Sensors you going to have

920
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,408
Inventory management

921
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:20,992
You're going to have this health-conscious kind of gold silver all working

922
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:21,760
Together

923
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,296
Deliver a good experience

924
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,856
This sounds magical

925
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
But

926
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,208
I'm not excited enough yet

927
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:30,976
Yet

928
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,768
To go out and buy all new appliances

929
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,328
So how do we I guess there's two questions

930
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:38,400
What is how long till we get to something like this but to

931
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:42,496
Is there a way to retrofit are you guys thinking about that or is it just

932
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,776
New staff

933
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,312
Get me to the mall

934
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,152
Are plants is the way we architect our cloud

935
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
We always are looking to be backwards

936
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,992
Apple so we don't

937
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,064
Deliver capability and it's only available on

938
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,856
Appliances in Newark

939
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,672
We want to make sure they're always carrying our existing

940
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,952
A customer base

941
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,512
In line so that when it comes out

942
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,792
Wait we don't leave you.

943
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,352
So do those from where updates into that connected

944
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,888
Experienced then we can

945
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,912
Make that Appliance

946
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
If it supports the mode

947
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,008
Capable for that new capabilities

948
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:19,360
That is definitely in the Forefront of these new content part

949
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,664
I love this anymore here listening

950
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
You got exciting new integration

951
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,272
There give me a call would love to talk to you about

952
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
How we bring next

953
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,112
Because it's agnostic

954
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,416
Some people are want to cook on drop

955
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,952
And that's how they want to use

956
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,608
MSP

957
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
Platform

958
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:46,240
We want to be that connecting piece in middle cuz that's why they always have to put it in the oven to bake it

959
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,895
So we want to be open to all these Integrations as they come cuz we know it's a very exciting space a lot of

960
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:57,247
Startups are out there every day with new and innovative ideas and we're open to

961
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,063
I'm sad about my lack of retrofit

962
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
Pets but I am excited

963
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,647
About your kind of forward-thinking

964
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Hiiraan

965
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,951
Teacher availability

966
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
So

967
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,023
One of the things I've been thinking about

968
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:13,375
With connected appliances especially things like ovens which should last for

969
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,423
I don't know 10 to 15 years

970
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,495
How do you kind of building

971
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:25,407
I guess is it margin or build a way to knowing that you're going to have to support this thing for you know the next decade

972
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
Decade and a half

973
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,479
Budgeting for that

974
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,015
How do you communicate that to

975
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
Customer

976
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,831
AC I'd love to answer that question

977
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:37,695
That's not really in my ballpark being a large company we have a lots of teams with

978
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:42,815
Distinct responsibilities and there are people looking at that but as you mentioned that's new

979
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,911
Adventure that we're getting into as how to manage the software that Appliance

980
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,959
Much much longer than we used to

981
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,007
So I would have to defer to

982
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
All nests

983
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
Question

984
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,591
Sounds good

985
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
Yes

986
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,919
There's probably nothing worse than in the oven

987
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,479
Actually probably a refrigerator that bricks itself

988
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
Toby turtle

989
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,295
Let's move into the laundry

990
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
Mostly because

991
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,207
I can't think of what I'd want in a connected washer and dryer other than like energy management features

992
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,511
Assured by people in the industry

993
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,303
That there are features that I

994
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,839
So I would love to hear you

995
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,911
The teacher that makes the most sense

996
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,959
In this laundry space is that

997
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:27,359
Often times people have that Bond repair on a different floor than they're spending the majority of their time you'll see it often

998
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
Basement

999
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
You'll see it

1000
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,943
Oftentimes upstairs in a bedroom

1001
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,967
We're on that

1002
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:37,343
Saturday maybe where you're doing your chores you're going around the house when you're cleaning and you have to do laundry

1003
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,903
You have to walk up and down those stairs

1004
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,463
The laundry is done how many times have you walked

1005
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,231
Upstairs

1006
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
Got to the

1007
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:48,607
To the unit and then realize it has 5 minutes left

1008
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,399
Are you go back downstairs

1009
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
Can you come back up

1010
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,727
Being able to know the status of that unit

1011
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,775
In itself is a very valuable thing

1012
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,311
Manage your time

1013
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,871
Because often times people don't love to do laundry

1014
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,663
It's kind of a task that has to be

1015
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
Did you have to do

1016
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,783
Every weekend and you want to do it in a short a time as you can

1017
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,575
Are we have Partnerships with

1018
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,367
Amazon TRS

1019
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,927
So that you can automatically reorder dryer sheets

1020
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,463
So now you don't have to worry

1021
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,559
About how many times have you reached over to put a load in there

1022
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:21,631
And realized that was the last dryer sheet or maybe you were out

1023
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,935
Right so having that automatically

1024
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
Replenishment

1025
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
Come along

1026
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,007
Connect appliances

1027
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,079
Another exciting example is been fixed and the tumble

1028
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:34,431
You're busy doing something you can't quite get there you don't want your clothes wrinkle

1029
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,759
If you found out that the timeout expired just extended tumble

1030
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,295
Turn off the heat and let the clothes

1031
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,599
Continue the temple so they don't wrinkle soap

1032
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
There's three or four

1033
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,415
Use cases fat laundry care

1034
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,695
Terilli's Breakside

1035
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Okay

1036
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:51,583
I always feel like my washer and dryer to high-tech features on there

1037
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,375
I don't even know what the

1038
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,447
This particular laundry cycle.

1039
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,263
How do I make this easier

1040
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,543
Or maybe I don't

1041
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,591
That's an exciting question

1042
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,943
Think about your laundry and all those Cycles you don't know what they mean

1043
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,223
Let's take it back

1044
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
To where we mention

1045
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,271
Presets for foods

1046
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,831
Let's say you know you have grass stains

1047
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,623
On Cotton

1048
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,647
Are bougie

1049
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,695
Why don't you just tell the unit

1050
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,767
So something in the future

1051
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,559
You should be smart enough to

1052
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,583
Understand

1053
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,631
I have Scott Fabrics

1054
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,959
Grass stains or wine or ketchup or whatever this thing that beats

1055
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,495
I figure out the best cycle for

1056
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,031
I like it

1057
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
Okay

1058
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:36,127
So here's the biggest most difficult question I have

1059
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,175
When it comes to appliances

1060
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,455
Which is

1061
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,503
Right now I have

1062
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:45,087
Appliances I I do have GE Appliances but I also have

1063
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,135
The Samsung refrigerator I have

1064
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
Bosch

1065
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
Stuff

1066
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
So I have

1067
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,487
Different stuff in my house

1068
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:56,351
And I bump I actually built my house and bought all my appliances at the same time but I chose different

1069
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
Appliances for that reason

1070
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,703
Are you guys ever going to work with you know

1071
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
Bosch

1072
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,031
Or is there going to be another middle person

1073
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,567
To handle all that for me

1074
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:11,711
But you do see us as you see is working with home hub so you see is working

1075
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
With

1076
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,015
Echo

1077
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,551
Don't be out there home hub

1078
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,087
That we will work with

1079
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:21,183
As people adopt the home hub and they so excited there's passionate

1080
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,231
Energy around the whole pup you'll see us

1081
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,767
Develop for that as well

1082
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,559
It is possible that that becomes

1083
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,351
Who's the broker for the appliances

1084
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,887
To work together

1085
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,655
Well

1086
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:37,311
Don't thank you so much for coming on the show today I am sad that I will not be able to try Geneva but at some point in time maybe I'll

1087
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:41,151
I'll pop into a store and see if I can check this out because

1088
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,943
It kind of sounds awesome

1089
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
Definitely

1090
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,783
