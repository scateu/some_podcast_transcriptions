We're going to talk about what you need to know

15
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,616
To build and talk about

16
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,640
The products

17
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,968
So let's get it started with Kevin shall we talk about

18
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,784
The most exciting piece of news this week or the most

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
Rising

20
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Piece of news this week

21
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,880
I don't know which is which but I

22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,464
I think you want to talk about Nest first all right

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,536
Oh I don't know that it is

24
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,120
I don't I mean it is newsy

25
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
It is something that's happening I'm going to just real quick to disclose that I do work for Google I do not work with the nest e more smart home

26
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
Products

27
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,616
And I have no knowledge of what's going on here

28
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,200
I can't really comment on what's been reported and that's the news

29
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:28,576
And the news is that Nest is going to move under Google

30
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,928
Which is part of alphabet so Nest was their own

31
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
Alphabet company right

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
Yes they were a separate sub

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
Subsidiary

34
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,096
Yeah they were young we separate subsidiary but

35
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,144
According to Fortune

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,776
The Nest team is going to become part of Google and reporting to Hiroshi lockheimer

37
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,360
Who is in charge of everything Android so that's

38
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
That's kind of interesting in and of itself that it's

39
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,968
Going to be according to reports

40
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
Mastoid part of

41
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,016
Deandre ayton

42
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
Especially with all of the

43
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
Grillo

44
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368
Hasbro Louis Cardinal Android

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
Fuchsia

46
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,720
There's a lots

47
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,512
Beti I think

48
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,304
And this is just personal opinion obviously

49
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,864
I think this should have happened from day one

50
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,960
I don't think it should have been a separate kind of company cuz I think that's what got it into

51
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
Trouble

52
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,776
Right we talked about that many times before

53
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,568
He was kind of autonomous and

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,432
And then because it was a separate subsidiary it had to show profits and

55
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
So it's kind of like

56
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
If Nest loses money

57
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
We probably won't know about that

58
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
Right

59
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Swell

60
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,416
Okay so that's the question right now they're saying

61
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Software

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,256
Which means the hardware division

63
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Is still there

64
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
Somewhere

65
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:48,448
Right there still a what would they be doing without developer

66
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
Marwan fawaz

67
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,848
Is running nest and he's got the hardware guys and he's got all that experience with the

68
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
Cable companies

69
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Spin selling

70
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,688
Those folks

71
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
Now we have

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
Possibly a hardware division that is stillness

73
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,600
Unless they just totally killed up subsidiary

74
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,184
It's hard to say because right now all we have are the reports of

75
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
The Developers

76
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
Moving over

77
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
So I know that there's

78
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
Probably more

79
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,888
Unanswered questions here that in Google hasn't officially commented at all

80
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
Break Google no comment from Google

81
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Yeah

82
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,568
Irish at some people later yes or late yesterday but have not heard back from them

83
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
Cuz I probably still sleeping

84
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
So

85
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,688
We still don't know those things but I think what we

86
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
I hope we know

87
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,272
Is a Toby a more cohesive

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,832
Platform play here for

89
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
The Smart Home

90
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
As opposed to having two separate groups now

91
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,792
And that makes sense because what we've seen with like the Amazon Echo for example is that

92
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,352
Smart home plus a personal assistant

93
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Makes sense

94
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
And Google

95
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,008
Under alphabet so Google has all the personal assistant uses

96
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
And intelligent

97
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,592
So even

98
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,480
Hardware to some degree because it Ayo Google announced the Google home that would it was called to make sure I get it

99
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,272
Right so that's that fix

100
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,856
Portico Amazon Echo type device with the personal assistants

101
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,672
Yeah I seen that says always been this separate Island

102
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
I just never understood why

103
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Now

104
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
Initially

105
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,095
There was a different Vision playing out for the smart

106
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,143
Please watch this happen

107
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
4 Lakeshore

108
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
A really long time

109
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,751
The original thought was you would have these connect

110
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:33,151
Two devices and then without a standards developing we all realize that holy cow that is just crazy talk and now it seems like

111
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
Like having some sort of

112
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,735
Easy voice control

113
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
Probably other controls around the house 2

114
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
Makes a lot more sense

115
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
And

116
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,695
To really sell this to Consumers you can't just offer like

117
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:51,839
You can't just tell them hey that we're going to sell you this personal assistant that could be awesome if you buy a bunch of lightbulbs another stock you got to have it

118
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Provide real value

119
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Right

120
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
There's that

121
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,823
I don't know what this means for nest is a hardware company I don't know what it means for all the works with Nest stuff

122
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,871
And those Partnerships because that's

123
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Stupid deal so

124
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,759
Cannon and maybe we'll only have one thread

125
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,319
After all this is said and done as well because do we have

126
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
2

127
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,463
Give me your threads mixed up with your weaves

128
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Is 2 weeks

129
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
Do basically the same thing

130
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
So yes that's also a

131
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
Okay so that's the

132
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
Google

133
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
Alphabet

134
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
Nest

135
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Saga

136
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
News I know man

137
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,847
3.2 billion dollars it's like the bottle reality

138
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
My goodness

139
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
But they're too

140
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
Really awesome pieces of news this week

141
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
So

142
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Nest fine

143
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
What did I call it surprising and

144
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,159
I forgot

145
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
I know that you are more

146
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
Excited about this

147
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
So excited

148
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
Samantha

149
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
Is the best and or exciting news

150
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
If you're facing

151
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
If your me

152
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
Sonos

153
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727
My favorite sound system

154
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:07,103
Launch today pi and it also launched a strategic partnership with the Amazon

155
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,639
With Amazon so

156
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,687
In 2017 you'll be able to

157
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
Control

158
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
Your Sonos

159
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
From your Echo

160
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,367
If I knew you'd be happy when I saw this news

161
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,183
Yes and they build some great commands like

162
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
What song is playing

163
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Play the song

164
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,559
Skip to the next song so there's actually some really

165
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,399
Granular controls that they're building in for this which is pretty cool

166
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,079
So that's that in the meantime Sonos is also opening up an API so it'll work with a lot of other devices as well

167
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,895
This would be cooler I think if

168
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,991
Sonos had Mike's built into their speakers none of my Sonos is have Mike's butt

169
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
I still think it's great

170
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
Cuz I've always wanted my Sonos to

171
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
To be the voice of my home

172
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Apus hard

173
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,695
I could see that change with this

174
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,999
New strategic partnership with Amazon

175
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:01,375
And it would not surprise me at all if he knew Sonos Hardware at some point in the near future with microphones

176
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
Antiques

177
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,215
She Who Shall Not Be Named voice services

178
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
Yes

179
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
No it's a good guess

180
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
Because

181
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
It makes total sense

182
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
It's kind of sad

183
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,295
And the other thing is Sonos now integrates with control4 Creston Lutron

184
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
In Savannah

185
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,391
So all of these bridges are going to let you

186
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
Control your Sonos

187
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,023
With some of the controllers for these products which is

188
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,071
Solutran could introduce

189
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,375
A $50 Pico remote for audio

190
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
So it's kind of like the ones they use for lighting

191
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
And shape control

192
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
It'll be used

193
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
With their soda

194
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Play pause

195
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,943
So on a rainy day you can say play My Rainy Day mix and close the blinds so I don't have to see the rain today

196
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Yes

197
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,271
How many people sit in the Gloom

198
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
Life is good

199
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
So I know

200
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:03,327
You're not excited but you have an event

201
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
It's just I went in a different direction

202
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
But I know there's a lot of people happy with

203
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
Saint Ignatius beso

204
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
It is exciting

205
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,079
So the other really exciting piece of news

206
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
Oh my God

207
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
You guys

208
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Nazi wave

209
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
Phillips

210
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
I don't want to talk about it

211
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
A particular product

212
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
BR30 lights

213
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
It's in white

214
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,463
And so far you guys were like what did Stacy just say it doesn't

215
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,791
Make any sense these are the downlight so Philips Hue downlight

216
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
Have only been in

217
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
In color

218
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
Austin Peay basketball

219
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,215
And this is made me sad because my house is filled with

220
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
KFC

221
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
Can light space

222
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
And $60 bulb is crazy

223
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
So now

224
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
Phillips

225
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
White ones

226
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
And they are

227
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
They're still

228
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,319
I was going to say 40 bucks

229
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879
Yeah I mean you could use your

230
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Phillips

231
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
And change the color to light

232
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
Okay

233
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
Yes but why would I spend

234
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
$60 on it

235
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Color bulb

236
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Did not used

237
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,423
Because you like to play disco music and have different color lights.

238
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
That is true

239
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:17,311
That is why I didn't answer your question now the rest of the world though you're right

240
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
People would rather stay

241
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
10:40 or less

242
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
I just have white are they

243
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,711
I'm assuming they're tunable they are

244
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,783
Yeah I'm happy about that I like to in football

245
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,831
Yes and if you're like

246
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
Stacy $40 is

247
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
I still way too much

248
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
That's okay

249
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Your

250
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
Let's see I've got currently running the GE light Link that are $15 they're running in my house you can also run the

251
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
Osram lightify

252
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
I think those are a 30 box

253
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,215
Those are running on my Philips Hue

254
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
In my house

255
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
And

256
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,615
So you don't actually have to go with the Philips Hue but you know if you were holding out for this because

257
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
Cuz

258
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
Give me

259
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,479
Then actually I haven't been holding out that

260
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Checkpoint I was like

261
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
Yeah I got it I got to put lights in my kitchen

262
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
So yeah so I'm excited about that

263
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,951
Two pieces of exciting

264
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Is my Sonos is

265
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
Going to get way more useful

266
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
And my Philips lights

267
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
In October

268
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
I can buy them

269
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
Okay now we're going to skip away from Phillips

270
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
We'll come back to it and talk about

271
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
Z-Wave

272
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,007
Z-Wave

273
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
A radio

274
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,591
For the connected home

275
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,383
Is opening up

276
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
And

277
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
What this means

278
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
Is that they are going

279
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
You no longer have to

280
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
To buy access

281
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
2

282
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,879
The software the firmware for a Z-Wave radio

283
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,487
The Z-Wave radio is actually been a standard under the eye to you for about 4 years

284
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
And two companies

285
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
Sigma in

286
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,119
I was going to call at Mitsubishi but it's mitsumi

287
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
Z-Wave chips

288
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
Z-Wave radio chip

289
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
Other people haven't really

290
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,311
Glommed onto making them because you still had to pay

291
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
To get access to the firmware in

292
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,663
That the profiles to make it work

293
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
Basically

294
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:02,015
So what they done here is they open those up so no longer

295
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
To pay any money

296
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,319
Make a Z-Wave

297
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,183
Rights you have access to the code you can create your own software

298
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Sea waves

299
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:14,047
Standards and so on so forth are free so they remove the barrier to entry which is awesome

300
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
I don't know what

301
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,631
Used to cost for that I can't imagine it was that expensive

302
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Sunset Bar

303
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:25,055
It was kind of it so there's two issues the fact that there were only two chipmakers meant the prices for Z-Wave radios

304
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
People are like

305
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
I don't know if this day was going to

306
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
You know it was just

307
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,527
It's hard when you develop a standard

308
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
Right you got to open it up

309
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
At some point

310
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,903
If you open it up too fast if it's too diluted

311
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
Did nothing works if you open it

312
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,463
Too slow

313
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:48,863
It was a lot of people are like you know what I'm going to try zigbee Yurts dead or if you're nasty like screw it I'm going to develop

314
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
Protocol

315
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
And they did thread

316
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
So

317
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,311
What is Z-Wave products in my house so I'm excited because this makes it a lot easier for things like

318
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,151
Amazon could integrate a Z-Wave radio into the echo for example. Without

319
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
Putzing around in a way that maybe it just didn't want to do

320
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
So what's good

321
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Z-Wave

322
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,903
So yes good news all around Alyssa

323
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
We have

324
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
What else do we have the

325
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,999
Bringing it run through

326
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
Earthquake news

327
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,119
Yeah well there because if he's going on there until going on today and

328
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:27,263
For several days after today so we can't cover everything cuz we don't know everything until next week but what do we know today

329
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
Well we know a couple things

330
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335
We know that

331
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,175
Drop the kitchen scale that you bought for your wife and she never used

332
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:42,879
Stand up with Bosch and what is going to do is it's got a whole vision for the smart kitchen I'm actually going to write about

333
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
So awesome

334
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,791
For making hardware and focusing more on making integrated recipes

335
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
So

336
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:56,959
If you got to drop scale and you're running a drop recipe and you can import your recipes into the Drop app

337
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,519
What'll do as it'll read instructions like

338
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,079
Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees

339
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,895
If you have a connected Bosch oven going forward

340
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
It'll automatically do that

341
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,015
That's Nifty Fifty Nifty

342
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
This is a very forward-looking

343
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
Can you play this is not something

344
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
How often do we bite

345
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
I think it's

346
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,279
I think it's a really compelling vision

347
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
Hope they can make it work.

348
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
Because holy cow

349
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Okay

350
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
So that's the drop stuff

351
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
The LG

352
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
LG has a cool fridge they showed off a Tifa

353
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
It's got a big

354
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Touch panel look

355
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Something but it's not a touchpad

356
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Instead

357
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
If you knock on it it turns translucent

358
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,343
It's pretty cool it's kind of like greyed out like a soda most matches the color of the

359
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
The fridge and then if you

360
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,231
Do the knock thing on it and becomes translucent now you can see inside the fridge without opening the door

361
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,839
I think it's kind of neat and I kind of like that better than what I've seen from Samsung with the

362
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,399
Basic with integrated touchscreen tablet in these things

363
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
Yeah I think

364
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Much more

365
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,543
Use folded 3lc inside your fridge then to be able to check Twitter

366
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
On your fridge

367
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,663
And honestly this is for super high-end this is totally like a

368
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,223
It's kind of like my touch faucet is stiff

369
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,295
People I touch it and it turns on and people that are fancy

370
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,623
Is it that practical the faucet is actually totally

371
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
I recommend everyone

372
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Okay

373
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
Dishwashers

374
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,511
Amazon Dash is teaming up with Bashi

375
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
So

376
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
The dash

377
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Fulfillment service

378
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
You can now

379
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
You're certain

380
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Bosch

381
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
And Siemens dishwashers will reorder dish

382
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
What are those called

383
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,639
The little candy looking packs that are too little dish detergent sings

384
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
So that's going to happen

385
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,199
Let's see

386
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
Slim tile

387
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
Tile d

388
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
Company that makes a

389
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Bluetooth tracker

390
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
They have launched a

391
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,927
Really tiny tile

392
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,231
Because the current tile is

393
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
I don't know it's about a quarter of an inch thick

394
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,095
And that's just too fat to stick in your wallet

395
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
So

396
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,191
They launched one that is now two credit cards thick

397
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
And you could pop that puppy in your wallet

398
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,055
You can just makes it easier to stick on the back of a remote

399
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
If you want to get up

400
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
It was remote the couch all the time

401
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
So

402
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
That's that

403
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,831
And they will also replace your tires so tile has a replacement service

404
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
That

405
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
When the battery runs out after a year

406
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,463
You said your old Thailand you get a new tile

407
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
If you want

408
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:33,119
Instead of buying the new tile you can send your old tile in if it's up for replacement and get the new fancy or tile

409
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,263
Thinner and Slimmer which is awesome it is also bigger than the original tile

410
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
Yeah it's kinda like they

411
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Tasty

412
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:47,711
Push down on the original title and stretched it out so it made it almost looks like it's a good

413
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,783
What's a 2-inch by 2-inch Square now just much better

414
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
Yes cuz it used to be a 1

415
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
To 5

416
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
So it is a platter

417
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
And large

418
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,559
30 bucks it is $30

419
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
If you send it back

420
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
If you send your old one back to

421
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
Is a temporary placement

422
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
You get to buy the new one

423
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
For $21

424
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
That's it

425
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
You can also buy

426
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
4 pack 400

427
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Okay

428
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
About

429
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
I don't think we have time cuz we have such an amazing

430
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
Thinking of you and I want to

431
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,159
Stuff that we can hold off for next week

432
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,207
So what time

433
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
Our stuff that we're going to come for it

434
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,047
Is Kevin got a new wink relay

435
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:40,447
Yep installed and I'll talk about next week I got the new Kevo door lock which is a touch to unlock its

436
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,495
Second gen Kevo I got that

437
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,591
And then we got the Philips motion sensor which is what I was telling you about earlier

438
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,687
Not only did they announce these new lights they also put out a motion sensor

439
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
And I've been living with that

440
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,503
And I have some real thoughts on

441
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
So

442
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
Get ready

443
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
We're going to have a message from our sponsor

444
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,511
And then we're going to have Chris Matthew who is the VP of iot engineering at Citrix

445
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
Who's going to tell you

446
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
What you need to know about radios

447
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
Pros and cons of using different protocols

448
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
And the pros and cons of dip

449
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Clouds

450
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,751
So dense information packed but it's

451
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
Really

452
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Good

453
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
And I try to save my protocol

454
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,151
Stay tuned

455
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:28,831
Hey everybody this is Stacy breaking into this week's Internet of Things podcast with a message from our sponsor this

456
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
Sponsor is macadamia

457
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,719
Their professional Design Services and Internet of Things solution developer

458
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Company

459
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
Building some really cool things

460
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,119
And explain how this happened we have will not

461
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,935
Who is president of RN Sports entertainment

462
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,495
To talk about a product called the fantasy scoreboard

463
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
Scoreboards

464
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,079
Is the next innovation

465
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
In home

466
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,639
Sports Entertainer

467
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,735
Bringing a piece of the arena or Stadium right into your very own home

468
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
With a wifi-enabled

469
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,831
Scoreboard for the NHL you can customize

470
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,391
The scoreboard in your home for your favorite team

471
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,951
And what it does is with the iot

472
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,023
We've got the in-home live update so it's

473
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,303
An actual scoreboard

474
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,655
At what the events are going on at any given Arena across North America for an NHL hockey

475
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Taemin

476
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,959
How did you guys

477
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Help them

478
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:22,335
So if you know with any connected internet product these days

479
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,383
You need a companion app

480
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:29,759
So we helped Tennessee scoreboard develop an app that allows you to pick your favorite team

481
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:36,159
Or if there was a team playing in a specific location that you wanted your scoreboard to show you're at that point in time cuz

482
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,975
Do you have friends over from a different state how you could do that

483
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,815
Of course we also enabled the scoreboard so that if you're playing

484
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:49,215
Choose ball or ping pong and Anna wanted to control that product entirely through voice interactions alone

485
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
That you could do that from your Amazon Echo

486
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,663
So will as he went to build the fantasy scoreboard what did you encounter

487
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
How to get the product

488
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
Hook up to Wi-Fi

489
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,367
We disassemble another product and found some technology in there with steered Us in the direction of macadamia out for narcotics

490
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
Alright so Thailand

491
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,719
What did you guys do to help bring

492
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255
The fantasy scoreboard

493
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,815
So with any connected product

494
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,863
You need a companion application and

495
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,471
You know Android and iOS prevalence you need to support those platforms

496
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:27,103
Is cloud conductivity the provides a connection to the NHL servers with the game stats

497
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,503
So there's a connection to the Azure Cloud the connection to the electric in Cloud so that I mentioned earlier lots of moving parts

498
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
And you need to work with a partner who's

499
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,391
Confident in these Technologies in the way to pull them all together

500
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,279
And deliver a product like this to Market on time and on budget is bring together for the custom

501
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,887
The customer now has the ability to be able to follow their favorite team's games

502
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
On demand

503
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
And or any other NHL team that's

504
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,775
Playing on any given night and oddly enough

505
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
It is a global solution

506
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,615
I was able to control my scoreboard

507
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
Nordstrom Las Vegas

508
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
With my scoreboard being in Edmonton Alberta

509
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
Designer app

510
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,759
I can select games

511
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
No matter where my scoreboard is

512
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
And it will follow every game I asked at the phone

513
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,415
And this is what so incredible with the Internet of Things

514
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,439
And what that

515
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,487
Spies in terms of value to Consumers

516
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:22,143
It's at conductivity that ability to stay connected to devices in your home wrapped around with a + credit

517
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
User experience

518
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,495
Is what we're all about and what we're all their building for a client

519
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,895

526
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351

I'm he founded

532
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,847
Before I could lose active Lewis's thing called Skynet

533
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,127
Was all about making like

534
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Everything talks

535
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
Everything else

536
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,967
And now that it's October Blue it's still about that

537
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
It's just now owned by Citrix

538
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,831
So this week we decided to do something kind of super

539
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,647
It's not super nerdy but it is a little bit

540
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,304
We wanted to give people who were trying to understand who are in the business of building products or maybe managing iot

541
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
Products away to think about

542
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
The tools that they have available

543
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,704
Because Chris has been doing this for

544
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
Courageous

545
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Aegis

546
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
Breakdown

547
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,408
What you need to know that internet-of-things Prada

548
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
So

549
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
Here we

550
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Chris

551
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,296
I want to build

552
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
Connected products

553
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
What should I even

554
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,672
How should I start what should I think about before I start

555
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,280
Oh my gosh

556
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,072
It's a really wide open

557
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,656
Question him we talked earlier there's so many different

558
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
Radio choices

559
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,752
Platform choices protocol choice

560
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,080
You really need to figure out what and its pros and cons

561
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
All of them

562
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,920
There's not a silver bullet. That's Donuts

563
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,224
It's heading in the industry so

564
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
Okay so if I'm thinking about this

565
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,064
First I've got to decide

566
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
A radio

567
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,160
And then maybe a messaging protocol

568
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
Maybe a cloud

569
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
How to post some place to put it

570
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,328
Are there other things I need to think about what I'm making

571
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,912
I think you've hit the big ones probably battery life

572
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:35,008
Why is another one cuz you know they all got different capabilities as far as like

573
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,384
How long will that device live do you like beacons are really good for living couple of years

574
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Where is

575
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,432
Wi-Fi device

576
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,992
They're always on not so much right

577
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,296
So we'll talk about that in the pros and cons

578
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,136
We might want to say the brains of the operation so

579
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,696
Is this going to be doing like a hardcore

580
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,512
You know Intel or arm a 9 Kenneth

581
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:00,096
Brain inside or could we do with the second MCU a microcontroller

582
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
Itty bitty

583
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:08,288
That's another really good question because I'm depending on how much logic I think you want on the edge of the network with the

584
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
Depend on how much

585
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,872
How smart that ship needs to be in

586
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,664
Form factor

587
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,224
If you're trying to make something really really small

588
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
Now you're definitely talking

589
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,552
Feeling better

590
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:24,160
Microcontrollers as opposed to being like a Raspberry Pi or something a little bit

591
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
Marker bigger

592
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
Start with Lodge

593
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,304
Chemical radios and go messaging

594
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,632
Unless we get off track

595
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
Which could happen with logic

596
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,520
Just big rules about what's out there

597
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,824
Do I want to buy something like

598
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
Do I want to buy my own

599
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
Macros

600
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,712
Controller for Mega stmicro or something or do I want to buy a platform like

601
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,832
Yes if you're ever talked about building something right we're going to prototypes

602
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,648
New and exciting that we're going to bring the market

603
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,256
What I usually do they start with something really with a good ecosystem

604
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:06,656
You're like an Arduino type of a microcontroller from going that route and it's okay if it's big and clumsy with a

605
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
Fretboard Yaya prototyping

606
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
Keep that in mind

607
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,800
And as you get to thinking I said it works

608
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,664
Successes that works then you can start looking okay

609
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,456
There's a lot of form factor

610
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,248
Just like this Arduino or other

611
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,064
Comprable microsystem devices

612
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,880
And then if you really do need that intelligence

613
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,440
Show processing power

614
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,256
Maybe start with the Raspberry Pi but then again

615
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,792
Tell that the Danube

616
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
Shipped the pocket chip

617
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,888
Came out there not too long ago there's a new

618
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,704
Dixon Oasis

619
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:45,056
Computers are all coming to Market with all various form factors to so

620
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:49,920
I usually start big with a bigger ecosystem and then work my way Indian once you have that success

621
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,968
Monkey way into

622
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,760
Fine tuning the form factor I think

623
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,600
Okay so that doesn't really change how you're going to architect or anything else

624
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,624
Statues down the road

625
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:03,232
Not typically need some of it it does like if you get into something

626
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,072
I hate to say proprietary like like maybe the particle. IO

627
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:13,216
Great ship it comes in like a wife ible and 3G

628
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,776
Aversion what you build with that

629
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
Particular product

630
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,872
You will be to speak stuck with that one

631
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:24,224
Platform was Hugo something a little bit more open like an Arduino Princeton

632
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,528
Then you got a much bigger ecosystem

633
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Okay

634
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,160
Again I know this depends on

635
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,208
Again

636
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,792
But like how should I be thinking about my radio selection

637
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,840
What are kind of the factors at play

638
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,864
I would say

639
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,144
Probably distance

640
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,424
Battery life

641
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Skip

642
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
Baby cost

643
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,776
Pernoud I don't know what that's a big deal

644
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
And then

645
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
Maybe if it measures or not

646
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:57,248
All of those are very good I came in fact I can't think of another another thing you have to add to that list Wi-Fi you're going to

647
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,528
Pretty good range

648
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,880
Shell's you may be mentioned earlier but then again there's a big drain on the battery

649
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Unless

650
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:08,768
You do it, the Amazon Dash route where it's it's basically offline

651
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,304
Until you press the button

652
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,376
K'Nex transmission goes back offline

653
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:17,728
It's a brilliant technique of seeing for giving that Wi-Fi

654
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
Distance

655
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
But also

656
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,848
Keeping with the battery light that's needed

657
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,176
Seems like the only way you're going to need to be closer

658
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,968
To Harbor something that

659
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
Communicating with

660
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,784
So that's something that

661
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,576
Keep in mind and then

662
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
Zigbee

663
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,440
There's so many different flavors if you will

664
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
That's also something else

665
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,000
Keep in mind that it's not

666
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,560
A Street Fall River protocol is

667
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,608
Doesn't think the industry would like

668
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
YouTube to believe

669
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,216
Okay and what about in an industrial setting

670
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
What about looking at

671
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,800
Proprietary protocols like I'm trying to think like

672
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Lakers Hart

673
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
There's

674
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
Old school

675
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Kind of

676
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,200
I want try to think

677
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,296
Modbus yeah

678
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,576
And there again

679
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
You're dealing with

680
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392
There is a legacy

681
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,720
Legacy Center Legacy scada controllers

682
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,304
Yo at the time cereal was the best option

683
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
Charlotte events

684
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,912
Technology or those both the hardware components and sensors even so

685
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
Tell you you can you definitely need to

686
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
Fly

687
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,824
What's right for the environment

688
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,128
Sister to move it forward

689
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
Sentences accommodation

690
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,712
Maybe sometimes you might go

691
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,272
You might connect with modbus friends

692
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,064
Install serial device

693
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
And then you might convert it

694
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
2

695
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,184
Yeah like websocket store

696
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,232
UT your or something

697
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
Something a little bit more

698
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,840
Modern and adaptable and today's I have to suck one

699
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
Yes

700
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,424
So now we get into

701
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
I just have

702
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
I cannot remember it

703
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,872
Anymore but there was a whole set of the whole verse where I just had to

704
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,064
So I'm sad that are a mess

705
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,088
Africa calls

706
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
We talked about

707
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,392
Mqtt

708
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
We talked about

709
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,464
Costco app there is XMP

710
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
PP

711
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:19,584
Amqp HTTP websockets DDS

712
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
Drawing

713
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,656
So how do we

714
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
How are

715
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,216
Give people who are not

716
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,752
Going to ever want to deal with that

717
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
A framework for how to say

718
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,872
The world of the web

719
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:36,480
I like to look at the world of the weather's taught us a lot of things about baby

720
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,296
Maybe the physical world like how we connect

721
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,576
Physical devices

722
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,672
Together and maybe physical devices over the web to other other devices

723
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,792
Tandem your HTTP yeah that was the winning protocol of the web

724
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
Websocket

725
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,840
Skim around

726
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,144
Castro said maybe a decade ago

727
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,472
Secreting like live bi-directional

728
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
Secure

729
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:04,640
Real-time communication so I think definitely those two are very interesting even even in the day of

730
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,200
Beauty and coaxial talk about 2

731
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,808
So I definitely don't want to Discount web Technologies or web protocols

732
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,344
Connecting

733
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,928
Seems like it I think that's a very interesting connectivity

734
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,256
But then there's all sorts of these other protocols at

735
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,328
Well they turn around 2 for some of them for a long time as well

736
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,864
Focused on

737
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:29,984
M2M Machining Machinery iot Communications in mqtt

738
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,544
That's probably that the grandfather

739
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,360
5 in 20 years

740
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,432
It stands for message queue Telemetry transport

741
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:43,808
And there's lots pros and cons with each of these as we're going to talk through but

742
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,088
Are we the best

743
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,392
Think about this protocol is

744
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
You can

745
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,232
Literally message a device that's offline

746
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
And when the device

747
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,048
He's back online

748
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,608
There's this concept of quality of service

749
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,192
Britt you can guarantee delivery of a message so in the device

750
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,728
Comes back online it says

751
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,288
It wakes up is he that I miss anything and

752
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:08,640
African said yeah you missed these three messages and now now you're all caught up

753
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
So it's that voice

754
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:13,760
Yes

755
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,064
So before we go

756
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,344
Before we go any further Chris

757
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
I got to tell people

758
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,416
What we're talking about here

759
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,696
With these protocols

760
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,256
Radios are just the physical way for something

761
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
Bike Share data

762
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
So

763
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,632
These protocols basically tell

764
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:36,288
The device's what the date is and what things are trying to do is that a fair way to talk about these I just want

765
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,848
How to make sure people understand

766
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,456
Yet most of these protocols do have like

767
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:47,808
Why refer to the transport layer and then that transports typically like the radio

768
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
Like you're right it's like

769
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
How do I get this

770
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,928
Text message from here to here and then what is the mess

771
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,464
It's look like inside of that

772
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,000
That's your protocol

773
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,840
So in this messaging layer let's break it down we got Legacy

774
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:05,984
We sat web and then we've got some of that do we have anything new yeah we do we have new things so let's start with Legacy

775
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,288
What's out there in the Legacy world

776
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
That

777
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
Still in use today or mites

778
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
Still be used

779
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:18,784
I think in two taquitos Reventon I mean 20 years in the running as an open

780
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,600
Open standard there's a lot of

781
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,136
New iot

782
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,184
Check being built on top of them

783
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,768
It's a very basic outside like a

784
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,328
Publish subscribe messaging platform

785
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:37,472
So there's other parts of the infrastructure that you need to be concerned about like a

786
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,008
Highly available message

787
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
Broker that knows

788
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,592
Mark's basically soap

789
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:47,968
What delivers a message to check that all saying okay I just delivered that to this guy he's good

790
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,272
I'll let you know when when I have another message

791
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,600
So does that require a lot of logic is part of

792
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,672
The message broker needs to be something that has brains inside

793
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,560
Yeah yeah so it's going to be something that's either going to run in the cloud or you're going to have to

794
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:07,168
Find messaging broker that small enough to fit on a Raspberry Pi 4

795
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
Incipere building

796
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
Encompassing

797
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,568
Platform ABC your home and your car

798
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,104
What other than

799
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,128
Should we talk about

800
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
Is Co-op

801
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
Old school

802
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,760
I think it's going to new school I think

803
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,832
Or SMTP burial School

804
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
Alphabet

805
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:36,352
You know those two are both really old so I think those are those are interesting so sleepy that one

806
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,704
What kind of oil Telecom background before this

807
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
That was like the

808
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,288
The protocol of choice for

809
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,568
Chat application

810
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
Teams in the day even

811
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,896
Even interactive voice response

812
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,688
Systems in Telecom systems

813
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,224
Managing messages

814
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,504
Between

815
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,552
Applications was a lot of DXM

816
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,880
Codility so very real bus

817
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
Open

818
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
Inspect

819
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,720
Bar security baked into it but

820
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,280
It's it's XML and

821
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,584
No one today really Developers

822
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,888
Anyway don't really want to write XML

823
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,936
Anything anymore they're all they're all

824
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,288
New message type format

825
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
Okay

826
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,616
So what we'll put that out there but

827
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,640
Probably not going to see it

828
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,432
So what about

829
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,200
Amqp

830
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:30,880
Am amqp

831
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,952
We connected aqua blue doll starts with other platforms like

832
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,512
Azure AWS bluemix

833
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,560
AT&T interaction others

834
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,632
Each of those platforms kind of have their preferred

835
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,704
Protocol to use and azure

836
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,008
Azra 80 is 8

837
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,056
So when when we

838
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,872
Talk to Azure that's typically the protocol we use it

839
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:57,248
It's similar to mqtt and in that it has a quality of service

840
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,040
But what what I've noticed is

841
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
It's a very

842
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,344
Daddy protocol

843
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,392
Skip that that also has it

844
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,440
Play snap your dealing with something

845
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,232
Very

846
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,768
Critical or very

847
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,608
State of communication are the states of the

848
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,400
Action is very very important

849
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,216
I can see that definitely benefits

850
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,800
About using a MCPE as a protocol they are as well

851
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:26,688
So that's when you really really really really really need to know what the message went through or if it hasn't

852
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
What state

853
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:35,392
Exactly so you might have gone through but maybe the device hasn't done anything with it yet amqp will keep tabs

854
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,720
It's stater in Flight State at state of action

855
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:43,072
Alright any other kind of these Legacy protocols we should think about her

856
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,888
Might be things to think about and cancer

857
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:53,568
But I think there's a DDS protocol we mentioned earlier is also one that I think was competing against in QT quite a bit

858
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:57,920
I still see it out there I still see it in the transportation industry

859
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,480
Definitely an industrial iot

860
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
From what I remember

861
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,808
It had an interesting approach

862
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:09,952
Using UDP instead of TCP which is also something to remember here is we talk about these protocols

863
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,280
I think so far all of them we've discussed it

864
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,304
CCP

865
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,608
Which means they have air handler

866
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,400
Built into the protocol

867
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,848
And it's assembling the packets on the way

868
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,200
And the way that they're supposed to be in the right order that that if there's

869
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,736
Are receiving a package

870
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,552
That TCP higher-level protocol

871
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,344
Manages hey

872
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,392
Resend packet number three

873
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,672
So I can reorder it

874
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,464
That's why you get the Jitter

875
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:47,072
Still sometimes like on video or something on a network

876
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,608
And TCP

877
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,144
The underlying Ark

878
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
Aventurine

879
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,704
That's a fair

880
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,008
That is fair

881
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,056
Yeah and then

882
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,848
Unity yashow

883
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,920
Which is coming back though I've seen

884
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:05,248
Some new file transfer protocol today

885
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:10,880
Better trying to start using UDP now with some type of him shaking over the top of it

886
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,416
And the reason for that is

887
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,464
If you take off all the

888
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,536
Hands shaking in the air and air correction

889
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,072
You can send

890
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
I don't know

891
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,656
What magnitude but a ton more mess

892
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,472
In real-time using UDP

893
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,056
So you got much more messages being sent to device

894
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,640
Which of the world of you and I were talking at lunch there.

895
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,200
If you're trying to control a battlebot

896
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,528
You don't really care if it doesn't or does not receive a package

897
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:42,624
Use what the singer receive a hundred times more packets than everyone else

898
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
More responsive with

899
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,208
With its weapons excetera

900
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:50,816
You definitely want to look at UDP because now you can send

901
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:57,472
Is so many more messages to device where you may not care like the the state of the hammer

902
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,544
Crashing down on the other battlebot use need to know

903
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,104
Okay we just got to keep this hammer and swing

904
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,664
If it misses a message

905
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,200
That very next messages

906
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,224
I was going to be

907
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,016
5 more degrees down

908
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,344
Cheap it's clean now it picks up where it left off

909
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
Got it

910
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,160
So now we know you're BattleBots

911
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,208
Yeah

912
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:24,608
GDP under don't you don't use why it don't use Wi-Fi cuz everyone else is and use UDP because you get

913
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
Four messages

914
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,144
That's how you

915
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,424
That's how you compete against me

916
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,496
If I have a product or a project

917
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,056
And I just need rap

918
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:40,480
And it's kind of an ongoing process that maybe doesn't need find granularity then UDP might be what I'ma

919
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,040
Yeah and I think that's for co-op

920
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,368
Comes in your some of the newer protocols were talking about

921
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,904
If you look at Co-op

922
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:53,536
Constrained application protocol

923
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,096
Looks like it's used case or sweet spot

924
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:01,472
Is maybe for low bandwidth Communications like maybe satellite Communications or

925
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,592
You don't have very large payloads very small little

926
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,384
Little packets of information

927
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
For lots of them

928
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,736
I'm Soo Co-op what I've noticed is it looks a lot like

929
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,784
Rest API

930
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,320
Rest API

931
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,600
But it's it's

932
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,624
Without handshake

933
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,392
King without TC

934
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,928
Wtp

935
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,208
Very very fast

936
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,232
Short

937
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
Messages

938
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Got it

939
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,584
Okay what else is in this newer kind of

940
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
Newer batch

941
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,288
Tutu that that that intrigued me one is all joy

942
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,872
They were trying to solve back then I am still are it's it's

943
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,200
Still very much alive protocol and project

944
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
But it was trying to

945
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,040
6-8 this idea where in a home environment

946
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,088
You might have devices that wanted

947
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:54,464
Discover other devices near them or in your in your same home and be able to message

948
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,000
I'm in such a way where

949
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,072
Earlier about mesh networks like

950
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
You really do sometimes

951
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,912
Want to create a very open

952
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,984
Discoverable message local network

953
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,800
On on-site in a car in a home

954
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,336
The downside is that

955
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,616
Not everything

956
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,664
Speaks all joints so you still need

957
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,736
Gateways to communicate Bridge

958
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,040
Other other protocols with all joints

959
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:19,808
When you need

960
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,856
I think one of their other

961
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,160
We are trying to solve

962
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
Rosen

963
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
Device

964
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:26,976
Making a

965
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,768
Connection out of your home

966
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,816
To the cloud Princeton

967
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,632
They were trying to broker all these

968
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,680
Messages in the one connection

969
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,704
Out of your home

970
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,008
And then after all

971
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
What are we working

972
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
The other one that I've been

973
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
Teen clothes

974
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,176
Hi Google

975
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
I think that one's

976
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:51,808
When you when you if you go to I think it's developers. Google.com weaves

977
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,600
When you look at how they

978
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,440
I look at this as maybe a modern version of all time

979
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,232
They looked and said okay

980
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,304
Let's identify how a lightbulb should

981
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,632
Talk how you should communicate with a light bulb

982
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,936
So they've tried to create this mapping

983
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:13,312
That all vendors potentially that that want to join the weaves Alliance and we project

984
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:17,152
Can basically say I'm going to make my light bulbs adapt to this

985
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
Weave

986
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,200
Specification

987
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,248
So that now I can just say

988
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,784
Light bulb number 6

989
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,088
Turn it on and turn it blue and then

990
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,392
Delek like we've been experimenting like

991
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,976
Top shoes and lifx bulbs and all these other ones that

992
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,768
The color blues are different

993
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,560
I think we've got some promise

994
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,376
I think if we even all join for smartphone stuff

995
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,448
Do you think of it as being something that might be used

996
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,984
Outsiders

997
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,544
Yeah so so

998
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
I know

999
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,920
With Citrix you only have to stop Flying or drones and start focusing on conference rooms

1000
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,480
I think there's a lot of similarities

1001
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,320
Smart home on steroids is what I look at Enterprise I

1002
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,392
I look at it saying

1003
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
1000

1004
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Conference room

1005
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,024
You I want to automate like

1006
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,144
When I walk into conference room that comes to life in the meeting starts in the presentation

1007
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,936
It's chromecasted in

1008
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:16,032
They have the bridge tiles for me in the lights adjustment

1009
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,384
But now I have to do this at

1010
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
Seymour

1011
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,528
Does rooms at talkin thousand rooms

1012
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,808
Workspace

1013
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,880
Yes it's I think it's it's the next

1014
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
Level

1015
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,464
Step after home home automation

1016
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
And now

1017
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,536
Hopefully you guys are finding

1018
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
If

1019
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
You're not

1020
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
We probably already lost you

1021
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,168
But now we're going to go into the bank account providers

1022
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,984
I think we've covered them

1023
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,056
I'm really sad that I can't remember my song to sing

1024
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,360
Antioch that would have made this whole thing like

1025
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,663
Or it

1026
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,551
How do I decide the pros and

1027
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,343
Deciding where to

1028
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:06,463
That's another important that part of the conversation in NC

1029
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,231
Might just

1030
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:11,839
Come down to Partnerships that your company already has in place

1031
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,631
You know if you're big

1032
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,935
AWS

1033
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
Stop

1034
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,519
User or maybe your ear Clausen

1035
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,055
Runs in Austin

1036
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:25,151
AWS iot might just be the right the right

1037
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,711
Iot platform for you

1038
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,759
Because what what they done in in

1039
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,807
I love their implementation

1040
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,599
It basically exposed

1041
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,927
Mqtt and websocket messaging

1042
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,695
Slayer

1043
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
To AWS

1044
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,535
So that now you can say when it when

1045
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:45,119
I receipt when this device receive the message in AWS

1046
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:48,191
Now do all of these other things that aided us

1047
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,727
Is really good at like

1048
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,751
Run a Lambda

1049
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,055
Serverless application or

1050
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:57,407
Do something in S3 or use API Gateway to do something else

1051
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:02,527
What day did I think was very strategic that basically created and iot

1052
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
Front door if you will

1053
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,855
Belt that allows

1054
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,671
AMA iot message

1055
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,487
To interact with anything in the AWS

1056
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
Cloud

1057
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,815
IBM bluemix

1058
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:21,215
If you look at that you know Watson is is getting a lot of mindshare around cognitive

1059
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,495
Computing and

1060
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:27,615
Trying to cure cancer and all these bees really Noble interesting ideas

1061
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
Lumix

1062
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,455
Is a platform that you think they really like you

1063
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,735
But they speak

1064
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
Dilapidated

1065
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,063
Websockets as well

1066
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
And

1067
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,879
I think if you're an IDM

1068
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,903
Customer today

1069
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:43,743
That platform certainly also has has a lot of Mary

1070
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,279
You're a soft layer

1071
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
Bloomix

1072
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,327
IBM customer

1073
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,863
And you're going to find

1074
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,191
Once you get into that front door you got a lot of other

1075
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,519
Ecosystem infrastructure there at play

1076
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
Which is where

1077
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,359
Everybody who's anybody seems

1078
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
To be going this

1079
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:04,479
Safety 1st a company earlier this year called Solaire

1080
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,503
And

1081
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,807
Very focused on on

1082
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:12,159
Machine machine Communications layer and again

1083
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,951
Tell they got asthma Analytics

1084
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,023
As as an infrastructure play they had a gerbil

1085
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:17,791
Morning

1086
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,839
As another infrastructure clay soap

1087
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,631
As you get more devices

1088
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
Disconnected

1089
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:26,239
Two afternoon again bait they really seem to like amqp

1090
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,031
Then you can see how you can

1091
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:31,103
Move the value of others Thursday

1092
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,175
If you're streaming a lot since your data you end up platform

1093
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:39,039
And you you want use Azure analytics or Azure machine learning

1094
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,343
I think that simplifies

1095
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,159
That's just directly connecting

1096
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,951
Things to to that platform

1097
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:50,047
And once once you're through the front door now I can route all of this

1098
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,887
The sensor data to Azrael Dexter Azure machine learning

1099
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,191
How important is it to

1100
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
The B

1101
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,495
All in on one platform

1102
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,335
And I'm asking this because some people might start like

1103
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,407
It might start their connected Journey with a product that

1104
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,431
Is buy like

Consider using electric imp for connectivity which means they end up hosted on electric gems Cloud they're sending

1106
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,159
Annotated there which is actually hosted on AWS

1107
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,463
But let's say they want to pull that data into

1108
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,487
Sing like Asher

1109
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,047
Is that just crazy talk is that

1110
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,095
Make an architecture fail for them

1111
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,679
Well that's exact reason we started October

1112
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,263
I mean we wanted to be a protocol agnostic

1113
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,543
And then as we can

1114
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,591
Matured the OCTA blue platform

1115
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,127
We've connected it

1116
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,919
To IBM bluemix

1117
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:42,527
To Azure iot to AWS iot so you can now move

Scrum master

1120
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,391
Throughout the blue to Blue Mix if you want

1121
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:51,231
Or pick any any big data store of your choosing

1122
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,303
Will Chris wonderful

1123
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:00,703
But I will say that the inner ankle is so cute. It's so tough

1124
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
So

1125
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,751
I appreciate

1126
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,567
You talking to me about this and hopefully

1127
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:10,175
For those of you guys out there who are trying to understand what all might go into

1128
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,247
Platform we just gave you a whole bunch of terms and

1129
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
And thoughts for you today

1130
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,319
Go look up orbi

1131
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,623
Just start banding around and feeling like

1132
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
You are like

1133
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,415
I got this iot

1134
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,439
He stuff yeah

1135
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:26,815
I would encourage you listen to start small celebrate your wins build spilled something

1136
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351
Small and

1137
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,119
Dad

1138
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:34,239
Not small form factor but a little a little concept and then as your your comfort expands

1139
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:39,359
Then come back and revisit the form factors and how you're actually going to take that to Market because

1140
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,431
I think the imagination is the most important

1141
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,735
Part of what you're trying to solve and if you can make

1142
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,527
A good user experience

1143
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,575
Yeah I think I think the rest will follow

1144
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,367
Start with one conference

1145
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
Not a thousand

1146
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,671
Yes

1147
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,695
All right

1148
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,999
