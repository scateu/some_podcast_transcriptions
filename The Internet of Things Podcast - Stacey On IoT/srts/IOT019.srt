Quite frankly not all here

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
So

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,328
This week we were talking about

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
Black hat

15
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
Last weekend

16
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,448
So all kinds of hacking of The Internet of Things

17
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,240
Cree connected light bulbs

18
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
Google

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,312
Crazy alphabet announcement

20
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,104
And a couple other exciting things

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,432
And we have a really interesting guests this week we have

22
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
Chef

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,992
Ryan from

24
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760
June

25
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,344
Which is that connected oven company we talked about a couple weeks ago

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,208
Yeah yeah easy bake oven for the 24 2015 I remember that

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,304
For the 21st century it's actually for 2016 is when it will be out

28
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
But we are talking about

29
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,144
The smart kitchen

30
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:15,520
Really fascinating conversation we are literally going to understand how the sausage

31
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
Gets made

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,872
Cool before we do anything

33
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,408
5 we have to talk

34
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
About

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
Google News what do you think

36
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:28,576
C is for cookie and that's good enough for me yes the alphabet

37
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,112
C is for Calico

38
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
Google's longevity moonshot project

39
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,440
2

40
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:38,816
I really are they come up with 26 different little subsidiary type things now

41
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,120
They've got five or so of them covered already

42
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,448
So what happened is this week it was actually Monday

43
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,216
Google

44
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,496
Which is no longer

45
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,520
It's just Google

46
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,848
Purchase a Larry Page put up a blog post saying that

47
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,896
Google was going to become

48
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
Alphabet

49
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:58,784
Or actually alphabet was going to become a conglomeration of companies

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,088
And Google would only become

51
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,904
Part of those companies so Google would be one part

52
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,720
Write alphabets like a new public holding company

53
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,512
And Google is one of the

54
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,304
It's a subsidiary of alphabet

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
Rate

56
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
The company's name will be the alphabet Inc

57
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,424
But it will trade under

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,776
Goog goog the public shares of the company will trade under GOOG

59
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
And

60
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,336
Sundar pichai

61
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,688
He is going to be the CEO of Google

62
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,064
And all the Google properties that we know and love and use like Android Google Maps

63
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
YouTube

64
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
Hangouts

65
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
Gmail all those things

66
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,232
Are going to be part of Google so basically the ad funded side of the

67
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,280
Write the product side the

68
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,120
Yeah they're there their the money-making side it was all go under Google

69
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
Yay

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
Understand

71
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
And then

72
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,264
All the kind of crazy future thinking stuff like

73
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
Fiber

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
Nest

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
Project X Project X

76
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Calico

77
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
And

78
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,736
It's Google capital and Google Investments are

79
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016
I'll go under

80
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,112
Other category so what happens is now Google it has

81
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,696
It's two reporting structures for Wall Street investment purposes

82
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:15,584
So you'll see the beautiful money making side we're all that ad delicious delicious ad Revenue comes from

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
And then you're going to see like

84
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
Other

85
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Other

86
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,520
I expect it probably doesn't make a lot of money

87
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
And that's where

88
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
Google's making all those

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
And Larry and Sergey will still be the

90
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:36,064
And I really don't know what they're going to do I think I just want to have more fun and less responsibility that's just me

91
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
I have to say

92
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,160
We want I wasn't kidding I don't think you were either

93
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,000
Yay for Sundar pichai because he came up through the ranks and

94
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:48,608
Took over Android for Andy Rubin couple years back and in 2013

95
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:55,008
And then he got Chrome and then he got all the Google products the docks and all the EX I think he had dogs before all of this

96
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
And now he's got like

97
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,944
Their entire product portfolio that makes the money so and I can't think of a better person there that promote from within from

98
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Loadout slots

99
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
That's good news to me

100
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
She has earned

101
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,576
The blog post

102
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:13,952
To me it looks very clear Larry Page in the blog post said it's clear to B&R board

103
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,512
Siddharth deserves this

104
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,071
It sounds like Wall Street canopy adults

105
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,119
The table feel they were pushing him

106
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
So it makes a lot of sense

107
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
From The Internet of Things perspect

108
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
Couple things

109
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
1

110
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
We got to look at Nest I think this is great

111
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,919
From the perspective of nesto the other thing is

112
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
All of these Google

113
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,527
The separate other companies in alphabet

114
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,831
Nest is going to be its own cum

115
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,903
Each company is headed by its own CEO

116
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,463
My guess is he hasn't actually pink

117
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
Confirmed anywhere

118
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,559
Tony fadell will continue to be the CEO of nest

119
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
That would make sense that make sense

120
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Should that change

121
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
Will let you know

122
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,751
I reach out to nest for comment they weren't commenting beyond the press release

123
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,615
But this is good for them because all along they've been a separate subsidiary of goo

124
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
When Google bought Nest back in

125
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,831
January of 2014 everyone was like

126
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:17,439
Thermostat this is terrible terrible terrible news for my privacy so anyway this is good

127
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719
Well

128
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,767
Yes but I mean really

129
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,095
That dated will still get fed into Google I mean let's be honest

130
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,679
No doubt that's just been very clear that they don't give that dated

131
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,031
Okay alright I guess the bigger picture is that

132
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,871
These other companies will still feed data into the

133
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
Into the Google

134
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Google

135
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,479
Shutting itself off from Gathering data from these companies

136
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Well

137
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,343
If they do that they would have to change the terms of agreement

138
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
Nest

139
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
So

140
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
Google is not right now grabbing the nest

141
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,535
Yeah it is because it is separate

142
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
So what you're saying

143
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,095
Is it actually happy

144
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,703
Yeah well I guess that it will alleviate some people's concerns

145
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:07,359
I did okay so so they break it out and there's there's these walls that were implied or were really there before our

146
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,639
Certainly there now

147
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,735
And you know that the big questions are now is it

148
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
Much easier to spend this out

149
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,575
I would also say this is a very different

150
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
Revenue model

151
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,927
The Internet of Things play for Google has always

152
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,743
Post kind of an existential threat because

153
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
The beauty of the internet of things as you spend

154
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,911
Less time looking at a screen either your smartphone or your computer and more time

155
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Interacting with

156
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,031
People in the devices around you hopefully in a more naturalistic way right

157
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
So

158
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,639
In a sense you spend less time searching and more time just like

159
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
Demanding things happen

160
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,991
Or just hoping things happen and they happen

161
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
Bright

162
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
So

163
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
We we know about nest

164
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,623
And we've seen what they've done

165
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,719
So far they still kept it separate and it is going to be separate going forward

166
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,255
I don't know that that's been

167
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,583
Great thing for Google's IRT efforts because

168
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Less

169
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,399
With her and you can correct me

170
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,775
Set the nest team really hadn't work with Google on their brillo and we've stuff it was just nope those are two separate things

171
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
So it's like huh

172
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
What what are they doing

173
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
Well that is a darn good question

174
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
Because

175
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
No one I've talked to

176
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
In any of my source

177
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
No one

178
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,135
Don't want anywhere on the planet anywhere

179
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,975
In the chip world in the like device world

180
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,047
In the software or router world

181
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:36,447
The sense I get from all of those people is Google doesn't yet really know what

182
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
Brillo and weave

183
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
Is going to be

184
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
So

185
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
I find it

186
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
Futuristic so I asked

187
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Google

188
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,759
What this meant for brillo and weave which was an Android effort

189
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
Said they would work with nest

190
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,207
And all of my sources say that Berlin Weaver coming out of Android they're not coming out of nest

191
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Today will work with nest

192
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:05,631
Which means that brillouin we've just got split off from nest and sober alone we've are going to be

193
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
BOS effort

194
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
For The Internet of Things

195
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,239
And that's going to still be

196
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Google

197
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
So is Nest just

198
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Pretty much

199
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:20,479
Smart thermostat and a smoke detector and whatever other similar products they can think of

200
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,039
NetSpend is going to be a physical Products Company

201
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,743
It's a juice as you were is extra margins and revenue will come not just from selling physical products

202
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:37,887
But we'll be building better products in understanding how to use the data that it Gathers

203
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
From those products to

204
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
Field Services

205
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,591
Build additional better products and that's where I think we'll see kind of the Innovation coming from

206
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
On the nest

207
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:54,015
And I kind of thought they would have already made some Headway there I guess that goes back to my point that they really haven't done much of anything

208
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:59,135
I actually wondered was it worth it was a 3.2 billion dollars to Google patroness was it really worth it

209
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,927
So far I haven't seen a lot of in

210
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
Indications that it is

211
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
I'll be honest with you I think

212
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,303
Build some pretty devices

213
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,631
The promise that Tony fadell

214
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Had

215
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,191
Was beautiful devices

216
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
And he's done that

217
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Total check

218
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
The secondary Prime

219
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
And we'll get into that

220
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:24,735
Said lovely Segway actually is building these anticipatory kind of devices that give you

221
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,759
You information

222
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
When you need it in your home

223
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
And that is a lot harder

224
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,671
And so

225
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,767
Idea is that you know your thermostat your smartphone begins to know you

226
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
Can anticipate your needs

227
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,887
Is there a variety of reasons one

228
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Being that

229
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:49,311
Devices don't work together and it's hard to build a stable of beautiful high-quality devices that

230
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
Minivan Apple

231
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
Apple doesn't build that

232
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
Devices

233
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
That's that's very difficult

234
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
So

235
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:04,159
My Nest is a wonderful example I think the works with Nest program actually is it's a really good program but even it's not perfect

236
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
And here comes mites

237
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
Then why is it not perfect Stacie

238
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,559
Tell me Stacy

239
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
I think it's a great motto

240
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
And one of my favorite examples is

241
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,215
The hue light bulb integration so

242
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,775
When you are away if you have an S

243
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
And you have the Philips hue light bulbs

244
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,895
Switch with the works with Nest program and

245
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
When you go away

246
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
In your lesson

247
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
Thermostat says hold is persons away

248
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,087
Are a few light bulbs will turn off and if you're away from more than one day

249
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,903
They will start toggling on and off on a

250
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
Pattern that somewhat random based on your schedule

251
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
I went on vacation

252
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
And my my lights did that

253
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
And it was

254
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
Awesome cuz I didn't set it

255
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
Except for that one time that I toggled

256
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
Except

257
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
When I got back from vacation

258
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
I noticed that my

259
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Lights

260
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
When turn on

261
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,455
I don't know around 6 ish

262
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
In the evening

263
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
And when

264
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,319
I would get up in the morning my

265
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,367
Lights downstairs and if I left

266
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,183
If I left my bedside table lamp on

267
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,023
Like I didn't turn it physically off at the switch I left it on like for the

268
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
Electronics to take over

269
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,607
If that would actually turn on around 6

270
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
6:30 in the morning

271
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
I could not I was like

272
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Okay

273
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,519
What is happening and what is this attached

274
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,615
What it what automation is causing this random thing to happen

275
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
Do you know what that sounds like

276
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
Well think about how the nest

277
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,551
Works when you get it you install it

278
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
And then you manually use it

279
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
Emitting about over the course of a week

280
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,719
A quote on quote learns how you want the house

281
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Heated and cooled

282
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,655
And then you don't do anything anymore right uses the away sensor as well as your schedule because it has learned your schedule your behalf

283
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,031
I almost almost sounds and this is crazy it sounds to me like it's sink

284
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
Spent while you were away

285
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,127
That lady behavior is your actual Behavior

286
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
Check the schedule that

287
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
My nest

288
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,991
Tad ebright yes

289
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,807
Yes it is set my lights based on

290
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
That schedule yeah that's what it sounds like

291
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
Yes

292
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
That is what happened

293
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,695
It's so smart right

294
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,511
Not so much now but it wasn't

295
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
Smart enough

296
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
To realize that

297
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
When I came

298
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
Back

299
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,399
Did it had to turn that

300
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,727
Off exactly that schedule should be no longer

301
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Valid

302
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,079
So it wasn't smart enough in that way in the other way it wasn't smart

303
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,383
Was there was no way that it

304
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Tell me

305
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
That's what it was doing

306
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,783
That's right exactly it maybe if you're if you're not me

307
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,623
You probably don't have your Philips Hue Lights hooked up to your nest

308
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
To your wink

309
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Echo

310
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
Write to you know me

311
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,607
Smarty face than that

312
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Yeah

313
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
Running down at list of things going

314
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
This probably isn't Edge case I would agree

315
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
But

316
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,055
I really want my smart home to have

317
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,359
Central Dash border like

318
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,687
And IRC or someplace where it's like

319
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,039
Hey Stacy I turned your lights on its 6:30 in the morning today

320
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
Because of this command

321
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
It came from here

322
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
If you don't like it

323
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
This is why

324
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,999
This gets back to where I used to love

325
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
Mine

326
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,071
Vnc on headless server

327
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,727
We're going to remotely log into and see the log file see all the commands see the scheduling and see everything that happened and why

328
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
And I understand that

329
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
Today's products don't have that because

330
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,919
Most people don't want that they want the Simplicity of it just working

331
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
The trick is

332
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,343
For people who do want it or need to dig into that those types of logs like you would probably want to do when you get home from vacation and noticed

333
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
Yeah this problem

334
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
It's all hidden away it's all distracted

335
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
And that's

336
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,023
You know that stuff still needs to be acceptable in my opinion

337
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,375
And I don't think that's too hard I think figuring out where that lives though

338
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,239
An issue like right now I don't have a 1 Central

339
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Place for

340
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,591
So I finally figured it out and I wouldn't I turned it off

341
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
The world was a happy place in

342
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
You don't start waking up

343
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
When are lights in volunteer

344
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,623
But that was that was it a case of a little bit of wonkiness a little bit of something being

345
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,183
Not quite intuitive enough

346
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
But you know getting there

347
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,791
So that was that was that

348
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
We should probably move on to

349
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,679
What if it hadn't been just a little bit of wonkiness what've hitted been

350
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
Got done

351
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
Packers

352
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,055
And I am officially wearing a black hat today

353
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
Seattle

354
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
If only I were wearing my

355
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,991
Yeah there's a lot of action going on

356
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:50,111
I didn't catch the story but you mentioned before the show there was some type of zigbee hack

357
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,439
Again in I really probably shouldn't call

358
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:59,071
You know why I write these in headlines and I feel instantly guilty because it's really a vulnerability

359
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
So jiggly is

360
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
One of the more popular

361
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,959
Wireless radio protocols in the home

362
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
So if you got you no sensors in your home

363
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,847
It's highly likely it's a zigbee based sensor

364
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
Is a wireless mesh Network

365
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Can protocol

366
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
Windows locks

367
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
Light bulb soda

368
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
My Philips Hue Lights

369
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,343
State-run zigbee

370
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
And they convert back to Wi-Fi

371
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Lot of stuff

372
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
So

373
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
But don't freak out

374
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
So what happened is

375
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
A researcher

376
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
Presented a paper

377
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
At blackhat

378
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
This

379
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
This last

380
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
This last weekend

381
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
Found

382
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,519
A couple vulnerabilities with the zigbee profile

383
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,591
It and it's basically housing B shares its

384
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Keys

385
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
It's encryption keys

386
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,711
So basically what happens is

387
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
It is it be Network

388
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,319
All the notes like they exchanged aqui

389
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,415
And the key basically that is used in most profiles is

390
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
Password it's the default encryption

391
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,839
Actually is it Bass Pro at the profiles are actually

392
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,935
128 bit AES encryption which is really good in Creek

393
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Instead of like

394
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Choosing

395
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Many of the option

396
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
In search of psychologist

397
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
So

398
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
Kind of like using admin or password

399
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
If you guess the default you're highly likely to get in

400
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,575
Password is 1 2 3

401
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
Exactly so basically

402
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,231
Bet that's the first element and then there's some other Ella

403
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
In there like

404
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:39,935
A lot of the nose out there they're not using expensive zigbee radios they're using like these little low power

405
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,263
Not very smart CB radios so someone messes with them

406
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,127
You can't really tell because they don't shut down if someone messes with them they're just like

407
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
London. Someone mess with me now I'm like a

408
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
I'm like a

409
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,015
An evil node on the network

410
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
Hahaha

411
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,599
I won't tell anybody cuz I'm too dumb

412
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
Is that what they really sound like

413
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:06,303
That's what they sound like if you're ever around when I'm playing with my network all of my devices

414
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
Just have a little funny voices

415
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,447
After the show I'm going to talk to my light bulbs and see what they say

416
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:19,359
Didn't like that it is somewhat deadens the pain as you're like sitting there is hooking something up again and again to

417
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
So that's the vulnerability

418
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,295
I wrote about it in my call I say it's really time

419
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
To stop blaming the consumer

420
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:37,279
The Internet of Things is really complicated it is way too much to expect consumers to be like

421
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:42,143
I mean gas consumers should totally be updating their firmware we should be updating all the time

422
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
We should

423
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,215
You smart passwords I agree

424
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
But after that

425
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,103
It's time for a manufacturer's to like really step the heck up

426
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:58,783
Yeah it mean this is again this is different than and I know we talked about this before this is different than a mobile device

427
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Sore

428
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,367
A laptop or desktop which obviously that gets

429
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,183
Packed into his is a bad thing no I'm not saying otherwise

430
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,999
But your house I mean that's your home that is

431
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,327
Azure domain and we need to make sure

432
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,143
But every safety precaution is taken when we start

433
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Turning over

434
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,751
The house to these gadgets that special the connected ones

435
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
Exactly

436
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
I just

437
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,127
I'm kind of sick of this idea that

438
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
You know people are like

439
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,247
Is there so many camps like the New York Times just ran an op-ed

440
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,551
Yesterday in this this woman

441
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Was like

442
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
We don't need the Internet of Things

443
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
You know it's

444
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,463
It's going to be insecure and it's stupid

445
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
And that was kind of the

446
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
Idea of her thesis was that

447
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,631
It's just too risky to attach all the stuff to the internet

448
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,703
And she ignored all the potential benefits and

449
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,007
I just was so frustrated by

450
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:57,151
That's like saying what are Amazon's what 20 years old now I think 15 years old whatever it is

451
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,967
Thanks 15 years old that's like saying now in today's day and age

452
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,527
You should never shop online Amazon because

453
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,063
You know reason AT&T

454
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
Security in

455
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
Privacy and

456
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
Credit card numbers

457
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
I mean

458
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,767
We got to realize this is the way the world is not going back

459
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
What time does SpaceX

460
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
I'd rather than

461
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
Say Doom and Gloom and don't ever use these things

462
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,703
Let's figure out how to beef up the security and make them

463
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,751
You know good enough that people are

464
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:27,871
You comfortable putting them in their houses and using them in on that way 15 years from now we don't have these kind of things about

465
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
House hacks and so on

466
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,199
Exactly know Morehouse hat

467
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
Yeah

468
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
How about a car hack

469
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,063
A car a cat tell me about your kayak

470
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
Yeah this is disappointing because I think

471
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:44,511
I think it had to do with the OnStar system in particular although I'm sure it would work with various cars

472
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,095
And we have few no OnStar on the on The Bold and whatnot but

473
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:52,447
Yasso a digital researcher his name is Samy kamkar he

474
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
Put together $30 device

475
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
That can

476
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,335
Where do I copy the signal

477
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,175
Cars remote you know that the key fobs that unlock the car

478
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,759
Like many hacks and I would say this

479
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Is a hack

480
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:10,623
This is only under certain situations and basically his device has to be

481
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
Near the car

482
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,975
When the car doors unlock so we can go grab

483
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
The wireless key code

484
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
It's not just

485
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,863
One key Cordova second read several because these things

486
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
Typical use rolling codes

487
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,703
Purple Tarzan for garage door switch

488
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,031
Attack works on garage doors to I can capture the codes to

489
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
To reopen those

490
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
So

491
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,431
Yeah that's that's bad and it again it gets back to what you were just saying

492
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:40,575
This comes down to the manufacturer's because what happened here when he figured out that the way to exploit this was

493
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
Codes don't expire

494
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,951
They can't be used more than once these rolling codes to unlock a car or garage door

495
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,279
But they don't expire so if it was never used in the first place because his

496
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Is little

497
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
Device captured it

498
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
It's a valid code

499
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,727
So the manufacturers have to work on some expirations on these throwing codes and such because right now

500
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
There's somebody who can

501
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,543
30 bucks go out

502
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,591
Get a little you know what device to

503
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,663
Get your key code and unlock your door for your car or

504
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
The garage door

505
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,479
Honestly I my car I'd probably rather

506
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
My car intro

507
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,319
Keep anything in my car

508
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,903
Bluetooth 2.1 replacement anyway

509
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
That's true

510
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:22,816
We will talk about my journey to a smarter car soon

511
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,400
So that's all I think that's almost all the time we have I should

512
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
Note because

513
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,984
People who like Wi-Fi will like this

514
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
D-Link

515
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,080
His launched a Wi-Fi

516
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
Water

517
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Sensor

518
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,152
Which is exciting

519
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,480
I cuz it's Wi-Fi because it's Wi-Fi

520
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
So

521
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Yay

522
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,064
It does have to be

523
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
Be plugged in

524
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,928
So it's being plugged in at the wall

525
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
And then it's

526
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,304
It's a 1.6 ft sensor cable so what you do is you plug it in

527
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
And then

528
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,864
There is a

529
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
Lan cable

530
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
In the censors at the tip of it

531
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,752
So that's how they dealt with the power issues associated

532
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
I would

533
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
Are considerable so this

534
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
My mind is

535
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,920
So far the only Wi-Fi water sensor on the market

536
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
Which is why I'm telling

537
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
That's about it

538
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,760
Because a lot of people like that sort of thing

539
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,368
And Belkin WeMo is supposed to have a Wi-Fi water sensor

540
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Sometime

541
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,464
And send it to email will work with Echo

542
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,512
Incentives Wiimote will work with Echo

543
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,072
Which means the echo could possibly be like

544
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,864
Alert alert

545
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,424
This stealing one will actually

546
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,960
Also work with the siren

547
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
There's a Wi-Fi siren

548
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Or you can

549
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,616
You can just have me around your house saying alert alert if you'd like that

550
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
Maybe you should put an MP3 up on

551
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
Podcast

552
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,784
You could be ringtone it could be your ringtone

553
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
Side

554
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,440
Wait one more thing before we go to the gas real quick I'll keep it short at prom

555
00:22:54,464 --> 00:23:00,608
Way back I want to say in December last year you tested the Cree LED connected bulbs is that right

556
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,960
Okay and you did not like a particular aspect or two about them which was

557
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Oh they Buzz

558
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,056
Yeah when you Dim them

559
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,640
That's true they buzzed

560
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,064
All right so I talked to the folks at creepy I asked him about this and they're like well we don't know what space is used

561
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
Listen that

562
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:26,464
So they didn't acknowledge that there was an issue or any like that but I said look at it if you don't think it was any more send me one

563
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
So guess what

564
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:33,376
And I have been using it for the past week and a half in My Den I got to connect to my echo so I can

565
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:39,008
Got turn it on or turn it off from the echo or I can do it from my Wink app because it's

566
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
Wink compatible bulb

567
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:46,944
And I'm not here in the buzzing you know what I'm getting old so I said you know what let me get my kids to a much better hearing

568
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736
You guys listen to me dimmed it

569
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Always

570
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,552
Six ways til Sunday turn on turn off

571
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,600
Didn't hear it either so

572
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Mine was in a

573
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:59,744
That may be why then

574
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,304
And the GE dimmer so both

575
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,352
Dimmable LED bulbs

576
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
I tested them in a

577
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
Dimmable lamp

578
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,472
Okay so they only Buzz

579
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
Best in the dimmable

580
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,080
That's okay

581
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,152
Good to know so people if you're going to Disney's these bulbs

582
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,736
I don't want to put them in the right table lamp

583
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:26,368
Just put them in a regular laughing and control the dimming through an app for voice however you want to do that so

584
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:32,768
These are the $15 white bulbs just so everybody knows the color temp is not my favorite it's 2700 Kelvin

585
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Sandwiches

586
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,840
Yellowish soft white but that's okay

587
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
815 lumens

588
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:42,240
And only uses 11 and 1/2 watt we fill the 60 watt replacement that they sent me

589
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
So it's working great

590
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:48,384
I'm fine with the soft white in My Den I'm not keen on that my office I use the daylight

591
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
Types

592
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
But

593
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,224
He's in a regular lamp then

594
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,064
They should be just fine at 4:15 bucks you got a connected zigbee bulb

595
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
From tree

596
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,904
Hey and Kevin just for those of us who don't speak Eldon

597
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
What is the daylight temperature

598
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,352
The daylight temperature is between 5000 kelvins 5000 kelvins and up

599
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,632
The bulbs that I have the

600
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,704
Sylvania osram bulbs that I have three of those

601
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,776
Those are tunable so I can go to down from 2700

602
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,336
Kelvin's to 6500 Kelvins

603
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,664
Does go all the way up to daylight which is 5000 and up

604
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,712
So that is

605
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:30,112
The update on the crease which is awesome that gives you another $15 ish option for those of you guys were like

606
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,928
Connect LEDs or bus

607
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:37,536
Relatively cheap I should say you know it's still more expensive than LED bulb but

608
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:41,120
4:15 bucks you almost can't go wrong

609
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
I certainly can

610
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,960
So because I've got it connected through the wink hub

611
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Through the wing

612
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
Steppin

613
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
You talk to through the

614
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
That is correct

615
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,224
It's all seamless it doesn't mean it sounds complicated but it's not it's not can you control cuz I had control

616
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:01,088
Decrees also through the Hughes but I could only do that I think a tattoo out of

617
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
Three of the Crees I was sent

618
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,416
And I had to do it manually

619
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
I couldn't search for it automatic

620
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:11,072
I only have one Cree bulb so I couldn't say how it work with multiples but

621
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:15,424
I did the search actually in the Wink app you just choose you know to add a product and

622
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,728
There's like a zillion choices in their anus

623
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:21,056
Go to the bulbs and craze listed in there and that was it

624
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,848
I was just like discovering any other bulb

625
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,896
But if you didn't have a wink

626
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
I don't know because I do have a wink

627
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
The question

628
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,016
So

629
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:34,112
I don't know if you want to unpair it from the wink just to make your life interesting

630
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,672
And see if you can add it to the hue

631
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:41,024
Cuz you would also could serve for those of you guys out there who have an echo but no

632
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
Wait wait

633
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,072
But you do have a key

634
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,144
That would be another possible option

635
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
That's correct

636
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,264
So I could possibly try that cuz I still have the Huey others not active right now

637
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
You don't have to

638
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,872
I'm just thinking out loud. You love giving me homework

639
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Baidu

640
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,504
That was a terrible evil laugh is it really work

641
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,808
It's cuz I'm not really evil

642
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
All right

643
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
We have got way over time

644
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
Keyboard with us because

645
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,208
If you stay tuned

646
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,024
We have a wonderful guest it is

647
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,840

Connected kitchens

652
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,800
And

653
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,104
It's actually literally how your

654
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,872

Is going to get made in the June oven so it's a it's a fun segment

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,904
Keep on listening

657
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:46,304
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast you are listing to Stacey Higginbotham

658

And I am interviewing

659
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:51,168
Ryan Baker who is a research Chef

660
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,192
At June

661
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,240
Hi Ryan how are you today

662
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
XTC

Man I am so excited

664
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,872
Because you

665
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
Combine like

666
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,664
Two of my love

667
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
The Internet of Things

668
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,736
Yay and cooking

669
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
So

670
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,136
Hideout riot at we can talk in ahead of the show and poor Ryan

671
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
He's going to be very tall

672
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Because

673
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,000
I've already like bombarding him with Quest

674
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
So

675
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
To get started

676
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Ryan

677
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,656
June is a company that I have written about

678
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,960
It is making a connected oven

679
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,592
It's very expensive but I'm already kind of like who I cannot wait for this to happen so

680
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,152
First off tell me a little bit about

681
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,456
June and why you came to work

682
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,248
With them as a research Chef

683
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,296
I came to June because

684
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,856
I was immediately Blown Away

685
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,392
Buy the product

686
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
And I was

687
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,464
Super excited to be part of the team that was

688
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
Doing something that nobody else was

689
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,912
And once I got to know that the people in the company I really got us sent the pictures of thing.

690
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
Integrity

691
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,496
Design something

692
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,544
You know Lord really really well

693
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Awesome

694
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,616
So for those of you guys are out there

695
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,248
Okay a connected oven this is not connected oven that is in your wall this is a countertop oven

696
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,064
And it is not just connected to the internet

697
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
What they've done

698
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,624
Is a padded Wi-Fi

699
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,904
But they've also added

700
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,952
Sensors in the feet of the oven

701
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,744
They've added a camera

702
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,328
And they've added an AI so basically what happens is

703
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
You can

704
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,144
Oana temperature probe

705
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
I should add that

706
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,472
So you can pop something into the June oven

707
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
Can recognize that using the camera

708
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
And the AI

709
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:38,944
And it can tell how much this object that you put in their ways

710
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,736
I can tell you the temperature of it

711
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,320
And then because it recognizes what it is how much it weighs

712
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,856
And it's temperature

713
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,696
And it has this kind of database of recipes about it it can

714
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
Basically say

715
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,280
Hey looks like you're baking a roast

716
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:57,376
You want to cook it for this long and it kind of gives you an ideal sense of

717
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,656
How long you should

718
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
Cookies

719
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,704
Is that about it

720
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,496
Getting better

721
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,544
I probably could have cut another 30 second

722
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
But

723
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:09,664
They've launched and I want to say it costs about $1,500

724
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,736
So it's kind of pricey

725
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
Most

726
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:18,368
Trays if it's most things that will not cook your Thanksgiving

727
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:24,512
So this will not replace your existing oven for people who are probably serious about

728
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
Mega cooking

729
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
But

730
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,144
You know what do you think about the products like from a

731
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,936
Professional chef standpoint

732
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,264
I love it I think it's a total game changer

733
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
What I love about it is

734
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,872
Cooking can be very intimidating

735
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
And

736
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,504
Having to do is is really inspire

737
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
Confidence

738
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,808
Tujunga

739
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,112
It's amazing how getting

740
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
Something bright

741
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,440
Create confidence and how you want to

742
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
Do that again

743
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:58,816
I think some people when they try recipe and they don't get it right the first time

744
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
Totally

745
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,680
I'm not going to try that again

746
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,960
I'm such a bad

747
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,496
What we really wanted

748
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,800
Really good people in their kitchens and

749
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,592
Inspire them to

750
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,128
Create Greg Nielsen

751
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
All right

752
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,712
So this isn't actually just a big giant

753
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,272
Woohoo going by the June oven

754
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,856
The reason I actually had you on the show Ryan is because

755
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,672
I am a huge believer in

756
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
Kind of I guess

757
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,744
The equalizing value of

758
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,768
Technology in the kitchen

759
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,560
And a lot of people are kind of like

760
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,096
I do not need

761
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
PetSmart

762
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,704
And did they used to be the truth of the Internet of Things

763
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,776
And I'm totally with them I don't need a smart refrigerator

764
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:45,920
I have been trying to sell and no one's made it for me so far but I've been trying to get someone to make me

765
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,992
Actually a spoon that measures viscosity

766
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,064
Because I think a spoon that measures viscosity

767
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,368
Would be an amazing tool for

768
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,672
Someone learning how to cook because

769
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,232
When you're trying to make a sauce or

770
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,280
Candy or something like that I think

771
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,328
Understanding how thick

772
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,144
Your sinuses is really an important thing

773
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,472
So I think tools like that or even something like having

774
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,800
Camera in the oven that can understand that

775
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,408
The skin on your roast chicken is just Brown enough that's the perfect amount of doneness

776
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,736
Those are the kind of ways that technology can really

777
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
Help home

778
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,064
Cooks are people learning how to cook

779
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,624
I'm so I would love to get your philosophy

780
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,696
How technology

781
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,232
Can really help

782
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
Cooking or help people

783
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
In the kitchen

784
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,376
And maybe doesn't learning to cook maybe it's people who already know how to

785
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
How to get

786
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
Ryan's

787
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,240
Philosophy of technology in the kitchen

788
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,568
Recognized

789
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
Edible ideas

790
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,712
I did a spoon demetric viscosity

791
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
I look the same.

792
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,088
You know you work for a company that

793
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,624
You know that they might get on

794
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,560
I love that I think that's a great idea

795
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
Isaac technology

796
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,472
As long as it as long as it works

797
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
And

798
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,544
PS I think I think

799
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,568
Doorways

800
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,616
Currency to simplify

801
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,968
You have something like a sous vide

802
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,736
Machine

803
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,040
It's such a simple easy

804
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,624
Appliances

805
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,416
Absolutely stunning

806
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
Consistent

807
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
Someone play

808
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,768
Are my feet so

809
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,048
Nervous to

810
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
Chicken breast

811
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,912
Because they don't know whether or not it's going to come out wrong

812
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
Or overcome

813
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,800
Music something like an immersion circulator sous-vide machine

814
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,336
Temperature

815
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:56,224
I can see the machines doing the work for then making sure

816
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
The chicken comes out perfectly

817
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,808
The way I think about

818
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
Technology in the

819
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,600
Kitchen

820
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
Is

821
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,464
I kind of divided up into three things or maybe it's four things

822
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,768
Google datastore will figure this out

823
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
There's the planning side of it

824
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,584
So there's the

825
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
The meal planning

826
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,144
Right if I'm thinking about

827
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
Home chef

828
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
There's prep

829
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:19,776
And so into that I'm thinking about like the drop kitchen scale

830
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
Or

831
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,360
Countertop by the orange chef

832
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:27,456
There's cooking so into that would fall like the June oven or

833
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,040
I can't think of the name of it but it's that little knob on your stove

834
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,576
There's the

835
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
The iGrill or the

836
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
Amber

837
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,928
Thermometer

838
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
Kind of things

839
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,024
I don't know if there's anything on serving

840
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,072
Consumption so that could be like

841
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,120
Vessel that the cup

842
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
Maybe the habit

843
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,424
Twerk It

844
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:52,032
Any sort of calorie counting apps or things like that so

845
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,848
I think about the world

846
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
Kind of Technology

847
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,200
Does that seem like a fair kind of breakdown

848
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,296
Absolutely and I think that's such a

849
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,088
Common philosophy that's growing

850
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
United States

851
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,416
If you if you look at it like that

852
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,232
Where do you think technology like

853
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,304
Does it make sense to have technology across all of those

854
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
Categories or

855
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,656
Where do you think it makes the most sense to

856
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:23,264
If your home cookware does it makes the most sense to invest because

857
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,544
Right now

858
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,944
Things don't necessarily work across all of these are going to be nice if I could buy a tool in each category

859
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,528
I could assure myself that everything worked across every

860
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,576
Category right but they don't so

861
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,392
Removing more

862
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,440
Toward integrated products

863
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:45,024
I'm having a built-in digital scale

864
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
Temperature

865
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,656
People are going to restaurant

866
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,704
A lot of new technology

867
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,848
Restaurant vent and hearing new terms and they're they're going to bring that home

868
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,664
There's a you know

869
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,456
A common theme in restaurants

870
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,504
Precision and concision

871
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
Is

872
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,344
Really wants restaurants

873
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,952
A lot of consumers want that in their home

874
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
How can I make

875
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,048
Perfectly

876
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,584
Cooked chicken

877
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:25,984
165 degrees and how can I do that each and every time

878
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,032
How did you use technology

879
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
Prior to working for June

880
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
In your kitchen

881
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,176
Cuz you were a private Chef before and then you would also worked

882
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
In

883
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,224
Professional kitchen

884
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
Restaurants in San

885
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
San Francisco as well yes

886
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,856
I definitely do know a technology

887
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,392
Cooking

888
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,208
A modernist

889
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
Innocent III

890
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
I love

891
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,072
Because technology that's coming out

892
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,864
You know my favorite

893
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,680
Appliances in my home would be

894
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,472
An immersion circulator

895
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,496
I use a lot of

896
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:02,592
Chamber ceiling batting machine so I can

897
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,920
Assist with cookie TV tonight

898
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,736
Take care of ingredients

899
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:12,064
If I go to the Farmers Market

900
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,368
Ansan incredibly beautiful

901
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,440
Strawberries I can vacuum sealed

902
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
The winter

903
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,584
Another one of my favorite tools is

904
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
And

905
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,912
It's a high speed blender

906
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,936
It has a

907
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704
Heating element

908
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,264
So you can actually

909
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,800
Cook in a blender

910
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,872
Oh my God you can make the best lemon custard and what if those things

911
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,176
Sorry

912
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,224
Incredible

913
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
Hollandaise

914
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,344
I'm making yeah making ice cream bases

915
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,928
Risotto

916
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,488
Wow cuz you would lose all of the leg

917
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,512
Chunkiness yes

918
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Of the

919
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
Risotto

920
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,864
Yeah and I don't know how you get

921
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,496
Maybe you know the agitation from

922
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,544
The blender might be able to

923
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,128
Okay I'm sitting here imagining like

924
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,920
Ricey cheesy pudding

925
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
Creation Institute

926
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,552
Which might also be delicious I I love anything

927
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
It's

928
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,880
Start cheating

929
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
Cheesy

930
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:20,928
Custody

931
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,464
As you can tell

932
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,024
At 4 my lemon custard enthusiasm there

933
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,376
So those are now are any of the things in your kid

934
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,056
I'm not using I don't use any of my my

935
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,592
Did Isis control them

936
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,896
Cuz they're at they're actually

937
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
A sous vide

938
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:46,528
Any sort of connected like some of the more popular in early connected

939
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,320
Devices were actually sous vide

940
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,368
Kind of homemade sous-vide things

941
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,416
Done in Crock-Pot

942
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,720
Actually just hack together with Arduino shoes

943
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,000
So I'm kind of

944
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,560
Curious because you could actually control

945
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,400
And modulate the temperature of things from afar if you wanted to

946
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
I don't know if that appeals to you or not

947
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:09,056
Yeah it is absolutely doesnae I think that those early model

948
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,360
Their only drawback was

949
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,920
Precision

950
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
Thermostat

951
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
Devices for using

952
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
Sous vide

953
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
Just it's all about precision

954
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
Censure

955
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,928
More and more companies will be designing

956
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,720
Circulators

957
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,256
You're able to control from you

958
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,840
I got another device

959
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,120
Yeah I can't wait for that

960
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,192
We talked a bit about your philosophy of

961
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
Cooking in the kitchen

962
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
End

963
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,312
Like I said like you like you said actually

964
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
This opens up

965
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:46,688
Kind of a world of cooking and I will say that when I was testing out

966
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,504
It was the drop kitchen scale

967
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:54,880
I thought it was kind of frustrating because they had a very modular recipe structure

968
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,160
It was like

969
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,952
Do this then do this

970
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,512
And I'm a little bit more slapdash in

971
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,608
How I cook and I like to consolidate bowls and that sort of thing and they were like

972
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,912
But this invisible and

973
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
Put this on the scale

974
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
I hated it

975
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,568
Scaleworks

976
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,664
The recipes that you had to use are the recipes they had in there at

977
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,200
I thought were a little

978
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,480
They used a little too much butter

979
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
But

980
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,600
You know it was fun my daughter though loved it she's actually wants one for her birthday

981
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
Because

982
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:31,744
She's never begged before and she loved the fact that it told her step by step

983
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,304
Told her exactly what to do and then

984
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,864
You know when you measure it on the scale that step was

985
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,424
What's done in a rush to cross the iPad screen

986
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,240
Nextep appeared

987
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:47,104
It was it was so interactive it had the screen component she thought it was fun she's

988
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,896
8 years old this is great

989
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,248
And watching her do that I was like you. This is a great way

990
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,528
To learn how to cook

991
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,856
And iiii just be very curious like

992
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,952
Bring this kind of technology in

993
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
Two everyday objects

994
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,304
Without it being quite so

995
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:13,216
I guess maybe quite so expensive or quite so I mean cuz the drop kitchen scale was $100

996
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,032
And then you had all these kind of customized dresses

997
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,312
The peace that you had to run

998
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
With the scale

999
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,408
Obviously you could use it like a normal kitchen scale but it wasn't his kind of

1000
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,688
Fun in modular

1001
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,528
And just trying to think you know normal people are not going to

1002
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,552
Redo the way they

1003
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:28,832
Right

1004
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,624
That seems like a big ass

1005
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
Ferlife

1006
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,232
There's there's supposed to cost element to Bringing technology into the

1007
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:39,072
Kitchen and then there's also a lot of these kind of services ask

1008
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,352
People search

1009
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,424
Either pick up new recipes or kind of

1010
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,960
Cook a slightly different way

1011
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,776
Do you think that's just crazy

1012
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,592
I don't think it's crazy I think that

1013
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,247
The cost will go down with you

1014
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,343
With a supply chain unit when the microwave

1015
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
Enough

1016
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,415
Wildly expensive and

1017
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,951
Now you know

1018
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,231
It's one of those things that

1019
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:12,095
You can buy a cheap one at Sears for $80 on sale

1020
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,679
Amanda has been one of the most revolutionary

1021
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,215
You know inventions

1022
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,287
Kitchen island

1023
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,359
What are you doing as a research Chef

1024
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
At June so Lake

1025
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,479
If I bought a June oven when it comes out next year

1026
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,039
Are you are you the guy training the AI

1027
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
I am yes

1028
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,695
Think about that I'd be cooking

1029
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
Dinner for you

1030
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,767
Every night if you were using the gym

1031
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,327
You certainly wouldn't be doing it every time

1032
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
Because I'm lazy

1033
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,935
Well maybe not

1034
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,727
What are the things that we have to do is

1035
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,007
Because people

1036
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,799
Super tired and excited

1037
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,359
I craving this eat that

1038
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,663
Might be something where one night you're like

1039
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,455
I just finished for the chicken breast

1040
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,735
And that

1041
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
Chef Ryan

1042
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,039
Cook for me and then

1043
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:07,391
You know on a Friday or Saturday night you might say you know what I want to get in

1044
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,207
To be controlling the 7th and

1045
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,511
Chef Ryan

1046
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,559
What do you have to tell me not to call you

1047
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,375
Canadian nickname I do not vent

1048
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,447
Chef Ryan and Spider-Man

1049
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,239
I'm going to toss him so much

1050
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,799
Some veggies and some apples and

1051
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,103
The parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs

1052
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
Let's go

1053
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,151
And it'll be like

1054
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
I don't do that

1055
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,223
So so what have you got

1056
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
What if you got cooking

1057
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,783
Be safe

1058
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
Really sucks

1059
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,879
I'm designing the cook settings for the computer vision

1060
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
Right now

1061
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,439
We

1062
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:45,279
Have the ability to recognize 15 different food items

1063
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
And

1064
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,351
What I'm doing every day it is

1065
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,631
Constantly

1066
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
Casting

1067
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
Chinese item song

1068
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,215
I might be cooking

1069
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,287
Cookies in a day

1070
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,359
Or 15 batches of cinnamon

1071
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
Making

1072
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
Testing the oven

1073
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,479
I'm seeing how long it takes

1074
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,063
For salmon to cook at 350 degrees

1075
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,647
Lighting all of that data

1076
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,463
So we can come up with the ideal

1077
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Exciting

1078
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,559
As we started tiling

1079
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,583
Thailand

1080
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,375
And really mastering these

1081
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,423
Computer vision

1082
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,215
I'm going to

1083
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,799
Work on designing actual recipe that we recommend

1084
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,687
It's almost like we have two different companies like

1085
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,223
Thursday Hardware

1086
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,759
June oven

1087
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,783
Products

1088
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
And there's a

1089
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,111
Jus recipe which is just

1090
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,415
And it's just as big a part of it

1091
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,719
Designing

1092
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,999
Recipes dinner

1093
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,071
For our products

1094
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,375
And John within that will have

1095
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,679
Really beautiful photography

1096
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,239
And instructional videos like right now

1097
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,031
Using

1098
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,383
Extended maybe 12-minute long

1099
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
Cooking video

1100
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:10,527
Everyday is just like constantly collaborating with the hardware and software

1101
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,855
Improvement

1102
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:19,487
This is something that just popped in my head as you were saying this but what happens when they do a software update

1103
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:26,143
Do they confer with you because like if they do is certain kind of software update could it like totally throw off your cooking time

1104
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,423
Times and estimates for Lake

1105
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
Salmon

1106
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,519
Control all of my oven

1107
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,543
Using

1108
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,103
Do you turn on my computer so I

1109
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,639
I'm writing command line

1110
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,175
Control the oven

1111
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
Wichita

1112
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
I never ever thought I would

1113
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,039
Ever do like writing code

1114
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,391
Yes

1115
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,463
Campfire cooking

1116
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,351
Burien shooting like you roast a s'more like you're cooking a marshmallow into like a light like burning too much

1117
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,887
And you move here

1118
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,191
Your hand in the stick away from the fire

1119
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,983
And the same thing except

1120
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,103
Lower the heat on

1121
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
The oven

1122
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,663
It's incredibly cool

1123
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,479
I never in a million years thought I'd be

1124
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,527
At my computer you know

1125
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,295
Commanding

1126
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,087
Five different oven

1127
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
Yes

1128
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,535
A lot of the software

1129
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,351
I'll be giving the software engineers

1130
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:32,191
The settings based on the command line

1131
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,495
So it really weird that you know there's

1132
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,543
A synchronicity between

1133
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,847
Design and the software

1134
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
Okay

1135
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,455
Yeah I know I was just suddenly thinking of Michael what happens if

1136
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
Cuz I would be

1137
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271
Okay

1138
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,551
This is

1139
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,831
This is fascinating

1140
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,855
An awesome

1141
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,135
And I cannot

1142
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
Wait

1143
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,439
2

1144
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
Taste

1145
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
B

1146
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,535
Recipes that you come up with

1147
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:01,887
CDA I I don't even know what the results of this will be

1148
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,447
But I wish I were there on cookie baking day

1149
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,471
Probably salmon

1150
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:10,079
Actually probably just all the time I'm sure you make a lot of wonderful food

1151
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,103
Did they get to eat it

1152
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,639
As long as it's not right

1153
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:18,015
Lots of lots of lots of like everybody taste everything

1154
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:23,135
Yeah it's great nothing ever ever goes to

1155
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,671
I'm sure it does

1156
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
Lestat

1157
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,719

1158
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,511
Well thank you so much

Ryan and

1161
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,375
I again cannot wait

1162
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,399
To play

1163
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,423
With the June oven

1164
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,959
Of my very own one day

1165
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,239

1166
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,287

1167
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,311
