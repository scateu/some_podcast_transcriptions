00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,520
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast

2
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:15,360
This is your host Stacey Higginbotham and this is your co-host

3
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,384
Kevin tofel

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,016
And today we have a great show for you we're going to talk about the merger of Qualcomm and nxp

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,600
Read about Microsoft's new security program and Security in general

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
We're going to talk about my

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,464
Brief visit to the beta store in Palo Alto

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,304
I've got some more low-power wide area network news for you

9
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,328
And

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,608
We've got

11
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,376
Brian.

12
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:41,728
Who is the chief security researcher at New Star

13
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,544
Who is the second of my two omigosh

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,592
There's an iot botnet out there

15
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,616
What do we do

16
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,152
So he's going to talk

17
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
A little bit about that

18
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
But first

19
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,736
A message from Mars

20
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,504
Sponsor

21
00:00:54,528 --> 00:01:00,672
Everyone's favorite phrase The Internet of Things stem from discussions involving ultra high frequency or UHF

22
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
RFID

23
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:07,328
UHF is power the industrial iot for a decade but what else do you know about UHF

24
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:11,680
Have you ever participated in a marathon you probably had a UHF label on your race bib

25
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
UHF RFID labels and tags typically have a reed range well over 5 mean in Spanish

26
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,664
Specialty tags could even detect moisture all without batteries

27
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,712
Ready to kick off your own project

28
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,784

34
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,824
Headed we are back to the show

35
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
Let's talk about

36
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
The big deal

37
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
In the space

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Closet

39
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:01,088
Yeah it is a big deal any most people know Qualcomm for their modems and Sosa's that are in

40
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,136
Most mobile devices these days

41
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
Nxpi ask remember

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,000
Then my first experience was as using X

43
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,304
Pea chips inside a phone for

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
NFC if I

45
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
Call correctly

46
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,264
And Qualcomm said hey we want some of that goodness that you have an XP they are buying them it looks like

47
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,336
It's a 39 billion dollar deal

48
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,616
Is it

49
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
Largest tech deal

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
Followed

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
Proceeded

52
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,528
Are you followed or preceded only by Dell EMC

53
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
Which was 67

54
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
So

55
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,416
Qualcomm here so

56
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,720
There's a couple really cool things that I think

57
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
Happening with this

58
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
1

59
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,608
Is Qualcomm gets nxp's car stuff every was really focused on

60
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
Smart to be focused on

61
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
We're talking about seeing like

62
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
It's like $1,100 worth of sensors in

63
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,592
So Qualcomm getting a piece of that action is good

64
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,896
Be great because they've been focused on kind of

65
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,736
The a task system so that autonomous Driving Systems

66
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
Recently

67
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,344
But not all the sensors I can your tire pressure in

68
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
There's their sensors

69
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,048
They got a little bit of this when they bought CSR actually

70
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
But not much

71
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
Answer this really complete

72
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,472
The other thing that's really exciting about Qualcomm

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,312
Nxp is now they have a microcontroller business

74
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,384
In The Internet of Things is all about micro

75
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,944
Polar seas are there really tiny semiconductors

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
They're here wearables therein

77
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,344
Where where else are they being there at they're everywhere they're basically anything that isn't the big

78
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,952
The arm cortex processors that are inside your phone that welcomes been working with

79
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Decades years

80
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,072
So these are these are the smaller lower powered ones that

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
In 32 bit

82
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
8-bit 60

83
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,216
Correct me if I'm wrong Qualcomm does not actually

84
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
Physically

85
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:59,616
Fabricated chips it outsources that but nxp does manufacture chips

86
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
Oh that's a hard question Kevin

87
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
Oh I'm sorry

88
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,016
No NXT. Sorry it's actually not

89
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
I just had to take

90
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,856
So Qualcomm is Fabolous and XP does

91
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
Has some Manufacturing

92
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
I don't know if it manufactures all of its chips

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143
So they do have manufacturing they also it's worth noting for those of you guys who remember they bought freescale about

94
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
A year ago

95
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
Which

96
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
Combines thereto

97
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
Steak-Out more car parts

98
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
They got some actually

99
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
With the freescale assets there's some

100
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
Cellular network radio

101
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
Chips that are

102
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
Like the chips that

103
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Operate

104
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Cellular

105
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
Networks like the network backend

106
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,855
So they got some of the network processors

107
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,695
Which will be good for Qualcomm because then maybe you've got this whole leg

108
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,559
And it Network stack cuz people in the industry

109
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
And really need

110
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,399
So all in all good deal

111
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:00,031
Qualcomm was always going to be challenged by the internet of things because it was such a wide customer

112
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,871
Suddenly this company that literally Qualcomm has dealt with

113
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
For most of its life it's dealt with like

114
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
The big carriers and

115
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
The big cell phone

116
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
Makers that's it and it's

117
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,623
Carrie different sales organization to support

118
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,927
Sub 100 customers

119
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,231
Anticipatory everybody who wants to buy

120
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
Chip for the

121
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
So this will help them there too

122
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
Business

123
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
And I don't know I have got nothing else to say about

124
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
I don't know I mean a little surprised that XP actually had more employees than Qualcomm which I did not

125
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
Plies until reading about the steel

126
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Oh yeah

127
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,199
Again that's it that's a difference

128
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,503
Difference in sales organizations

129
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,087
I have a lot more excuse like a lot word tips

130
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
Nxp is

131
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
It is big

132
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
It's not fancy

133
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
But it is big

134
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
Alright so

135
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,583
Massive chip consolidation deal there

136
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Very exciting

137
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
Now we should talk about

138
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
Security

139
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
Nxp

140
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Qualcomm

141
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,311
Actually I was going to say nxpi no offers end-to-end security

142
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
But this is not that

143
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Type of security

144
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,479
This is Microsoft creating an iot security audit program

145
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
Or it looks like it's

146
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,831
Cloud customers but it also talks about

147
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
Working with

148
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,671
Other standards group so maybe we're going to have

149
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
It work on

150
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,535
Devices that are hosted in other clouds as long as they eventually talk

151
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
How to measure

152
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:32,703
Yeah I was just going to say it first I thought this was as your specific but Microsoft is going to be working with t and a

153
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
Industrial internet Consortium

154
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:39,359
To assist with you iot protocols for the industry and best practices so

155
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,919
It doesn't seem too specific to

156
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,223
Azure iot efforts for Microsoft

157
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,039
It's just the name so the name again

158
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
Who doesn't love a good name

159
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
This is not a good name it's

160
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
Security program for azure iot

161
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,719
Yeah highly specific

162
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,511
And very descriptive but

163
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
You know I'm not like

164
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
This probably isn't something going to call it a door

165
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
Here's why it matters

166
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,935
It matters because

167
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,519
One Security audit please thank you

168
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,591
Add to cart

169
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
I love it

170
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,039
So a matters because after the drama

171
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
October 20th

172
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,391
First Citizen was this was a couple weeks ago

173
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
When people were suddenly like

174
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,207
Holy cow

175
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231
We have a lot of

176
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
Connect two things

177
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
Unsecured

178
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
Insecure

179
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:41,823
That is renewed the conversation about this and that people in the industry been talking about this for years they're like

180
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
When are people going to realize this

181
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
So we may be there

182
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
And people may be willing to pay for security

183
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
But the challenge is because

184
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,063
Because there's so many moving parts you've got

185
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,927
The chips you put in devices like the microcontrollers and you got the radios and then you got

186
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,023
Maybe the connection to a Gateway in House at a factory

187
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
The Gateway myconnect

188
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,399
To the cloud and then you got the cloud back in like as your database security

189
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
There's a lot of stuff

190
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
Software firmware and then

191
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
It's a mess

192
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,871
Everyone has been saying someone should really come up with some sort of Unified

193
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
Like security

194
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
Service in people

195
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
I pay for it

196
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,295
On the Enterprise side that's kind of what it looks like Microsoft is done

197
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
We'll have to wait and see

198
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,135
But the working with the eye I see the

199
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,487
Industrial internet Consortium is pretty good and Microsoft being Microsoft

200
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
I really do think

201
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
They know what they're talking about

202
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
And they're aware of

203
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
The challenges

204
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
So

205
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
That'll be great

206
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,703
It's one of the first vendors to offer something

207
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Like this

208
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
And then

209
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
I'm very curious to see what happens though

210
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
On the consumer side

211
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
Because that's where

212
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,895
I think a lot of other

213
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,431
Kind of a lot of these products are

214
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
SMB that

215
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
We're attacked as part of the Mirai botnet

216
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
Actually smbs

217
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,647
Businesses that Microsoft makes a point of saying that they will work with those come

218
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
Japanese

219
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
So yay for them

220
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,535
Put on the consumer side people are really worried and I'm curious who might

221
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Solve

222
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,911
That guy Wonder it's been a question we've had for a long time

223
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,215
So we are seeing that maybe

224
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
Carrier I still think that

225
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
Carriers could it like isps could do it

226
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
I think that's a really good option

227
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,711
I also think that maybe if you're a hub vendor

228
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,015
Like SmartThings or

229
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
Wink or

230
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
I don't know

231
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Your light

232
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,135
I mean there's a there's a bunch of hugs out there

233
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
Nexia

234
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:38,047
Maybe one of those companies will be able to offer like a security audit for the home is an add-on

235
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Can service

236
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
Again

237
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Click

238
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Pay

239
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
So I'm curious

240
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Would you guys be willing to pay for

241
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
Especially without any real

242
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,223
That's yes sir that's the tricky part and as you said with all of the moving Parts you know it's frustrating

243
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,295
Just getting things set up to begin with we talk about this

244
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,623
Yeah I nausea before just setting things up as a consumer

245
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,951
Is an exercise in futility most often

246
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,999
Actually understanding

247
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:13,119
And securing everything you're putting into place putting the burden on the consumers really tough

248
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,679
It's just it's just a challenge

249
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
You know

250
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,287
It is and I should actually say something so a couple shows ago I talked about

251
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
Credit to net worth

252
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
For my iot stuff

253
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
I'm still planning on doing that

254
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
And you guys have been

255
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
Awesome about sending me suggestions

256
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,319
I have been waiting for me to be in my house

257
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,111
And it'll to tear down my network

258
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
For longer than life

259
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Like a day and a half

260
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
So that's coming in

261
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,767
In two weeks so stay tuned for that and

262
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,559
Already I realized

263
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:48,191
Just maybe an impossible thing to do because there's a lot of functionality that I want

264
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
Where's my phone

265
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
But my phone

266
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Great

267
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
So

268
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:58,687
Are you trying to work my way around this by putting things on a tablet and just maybe giving up on go

269
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
No that wouldn't be the end of the world made I would take

270
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,391
A more secure approach as opposed to a more convenient one if I could

271
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,511
And you're moving away from the phone I totally understand that and that is the challenge

272
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303
So maybe if he comes

273
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,631
I totally a voice-activated system for you

274
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
I'm awesome

275
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,031
There's also the option of doing something with if this and that and letting

276
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
Instead of my phone going on the net

277
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,383
Maybe doing something via

278
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,919
The GPS on my phone

279
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
In my house

280
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Radius

281
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,783
With if this and that and that triggering

282
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
Me being home to

283
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
One device

284
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
Like the nest thermostat that controls a lot

285
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
Things I don't know

286
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:46,303
I might have to have a hub that works with its this and that. Which would be nybakke to SmartThings

287
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
It's going to be

288
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:53,471
Tricky no matter what unfortunately

289
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
All right

290
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:59,103
That's my little addendum cuz you guys have been so awesome sending me ideas and thoughts I wanted to thank you

291
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,383
Before it and tell you where that was

292
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
In my travels though

293
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
I have visited some very exciting

294
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,111
I went last week to the beta store in

295
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
Attalla Al

296
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
I'm jealous

297
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:19,071
It's exciting so anyone looking for this it's bait with a b8ta just so you know

298
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,887
I sure looking and this store is

299
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,215
Right now the only one of its kind it's their launching 1in

300
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,751
Seattle and

301
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
Santa Monica by the end of this year but

302
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:36,479
What is a place where device makers pay to get into the store and the company basically

303
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:42,367
Please shows you the devices in the store they demo the products for you there's video demos everywhere

304
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
There were probably

305
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:48,255
I'm going to ask me and I'm probably estimating wrong maybe 50 devices in there

306
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
And there were things like

307
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,839
A wide array of VR headsets

308
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
Some crazy

309
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Helmet type

310
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
A lot of wearables

311
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
Whole counter of smart

312
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
Devices select

313
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
The Beyond light bulbs

314
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:08,735
Yes it be on bulbs with security on protection

315
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,295
Had a prototype version of the Luma router

316
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:17,695
Guys in this store the week relay with $70

317
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,511
I know so apparently

318
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:26,911
In that store something's get differential pricing as vendors want to try things out cuz people who

319
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
Show they're basically they get to control their demo units and pricing and they said all that and I can set it real time

320
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Time if they want

321
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
Pretty cool

322
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
So I almost

323
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,527
To wink relays but I didn't because my husband decided that he did not want those in the house

324
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,343
And because they were too fat for me to bring home in

325
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
My suitcase

326
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
Thunder

327
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Bummer

328
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
The boxes for

329
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,255
Yeah yeah

330
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Dot-dot-dot all

331
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,607
I'm actually looking at all the products that they have on on the site

332
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,655
And there's a wide range mean there's a lot of

333
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
Consumer e

334
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,007
Fun things you know if you want to play with the bb-8

335
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,543
Droid by Sphero

336
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
I'll get there a lot of

337
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
Yeah toys

338
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
Actual toys

339
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
For kids not just Toys R Us

340
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
Define kids

341
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Okay

342
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:23,231
They have one of my favorites which is cubelets I love those things they're like these little modular robots they're probably not for

343
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Kids cut their soup

344
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
If you have a nerdy friendship

345
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
All my friends are nerdy what do you say

346
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
Well if you haven't heard from that you like a lot

347
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Because he's

348
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,799
So I was in love with a store if you are in Palo Alto or

349
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:41,151
Before the end of this year when they open in Seattle in Santa Monica I recommend popping Bybee

350
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Because

351
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,199
It was a really fun place

352
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,015
And all the people who live in Palo Alto your life

353
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Yeah yeah

354
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
Yeah yeah

355
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,415
Yep energy

356
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
Okay

357
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,815
So I was going to talk about iot because

358
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,935
Harry Green wrote an essay over Harriet green who's the head of the Internet of Things efforts

359
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
IBM

360
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,775
Did an essay over it venturebeat explaining

361
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,359
How the blockchain was going to change iot

362
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
I'm watching you guys

363
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,455
It's not just the back end of a cryptocurrency

364
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:20,831
It's basically a distributed Ledger system and IBM has been flogging blockchain as a potential for

365
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,391
The internet of things for years like

366
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Two or three

367
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,743
And the interesting thing about it is is because it's distributed

368
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,071
What you can do is you can have your devices create a network

369
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,655
And instead of everything being hosted back in the cloud

370
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
Things can be hosted

371
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Online

372
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
Individual device Network

373
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,847
Work so there companies like filament that are trying to do this

374
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
4

375
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
Rural areas

376
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,479
IBM seem stood there when they were showing off a

377
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
Blockchain parking meter

378
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:56,671
Concept at the arm check show and it seems instead of doing everything

379
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Kind of locally

380
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:03,839
And reaping the economics of not having to support a cloud infrastructure pretend years for a device that may not

381
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
You really require it

382
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,519
But it it's aren't paying the parking meter example actually did go back to Bloomix so I be a maybe now

383
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335
What type of distributed Ledger in literature

384
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
I can host all the time

385
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,687
But the interesting thing about it is

386
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
With the standard

387
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:24,575
All the sensors in the parking lot can kind of know the status of each other

388
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,391
Can communicate that not just to the parking lot

389
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Owner

390
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
Billing System

391
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
And

392
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Even to a city

393
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
If the city wanted to eat

394
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,351
Grab the information and do something with it

395
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,631
For like events

396
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,191
Hey I just thought it was kind of a neat demo

397
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,079
I'm not hearing a lot about blockchain for iot outside of IBM

398
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,151
So I don't really know where this is at

399
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,503
Don't know I haven't heard a ton about it either and I message

400
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,367
Yeah but since then it just kind of has cooled off or we just haven't

401
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,671
I don't know what's going on

402
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:07,327
That means it's always been a question site is it replacing the cloud is it supplement in the cloud

403
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,631
What's the real benefit here

404
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:15,007
Aside from you know basically a public Ledger every single transaction between devices and

405
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,823
And such every single bit of data can

406
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,127
Theoretically we can trace back and viewed

407
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
But I haven't seen anybody

408
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
Demonstrate how they're going to use it

409
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
Did wheelie show benefit yet

410
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,831
For example what IBM shirt off you would mention that the parking meter

411
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:34,719
What if they did the same thing without using blockchain what's the benefit the day it was straight that I don't know that they did I mean obviously

412
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
Not

413
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,351
Yeah that's and that's probably why we're not here

414
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,679
I know that it is a does reduce cost

415
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:49,311
And for financial transactions it can provide an immediacy that is just

416
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Preston

417
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Correct so

418
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,711
But with iot we have things that are already relatively in

419
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,295
That is I am here

420
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,855
Making a Ponderosa near real-time

421
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
Near real

422
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
So

423
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
I don't know

424
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,231
I'm going to keep an eye on it because I'm obsessed with like

425
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
The potential here

426
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
But

427
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
I'd still like

428
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:16,447
Don't get too sucked in by the hype you guys because so far it's really only IBM that's pushing this

429
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
And showing off stuff

430
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
And they've been doing this

431
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,311
Other related stuff

432
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,359
Actually not at all related stuff

433
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,943
We've got a wide area network

434
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
Sperry different

435
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Dairy dip

436
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
So

437
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:36,415
Don't be dismayed by the fact that I just drank a whole bunch of words together that may not make sense there's got to be some more

438
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
But

439
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,535
What is happening these are Networks

440
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
The cellular network

441
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,399
These are really low power

442
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Like I said

443
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Networks

444
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,495
Like usually they communicate

445
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,823
At less than 1 megabit per second of bandwidth in the case of

446
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,199
You know and they do it over huge distances in the idea is you connect sensors to be

447
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
Please

448
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Because

449
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
They don't require a lot of power

450
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,343
So you don't have to change your batteries in your sensors for a while

451
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,415
And they're cheap and easy way to like

452
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,463
Play and send like State data

453
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
Back and forth so

454
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
It's 78 degrees

455
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
I'm on I'm off

456
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,351
That kind of information

457
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,167
A small amounts of data sent often

458
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
So

459
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,495
We are talking about this because

460
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
So you guys are going to love it

461
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,383
Eyes have a story about Singapore creating their first

462
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,943
Live NB iot trial

463
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,295
And I was like nb-iot what the heck

464
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
And I discovered you guys

465
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Attendee IRT

466
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,719
Is a cellular standard so by that I mean it's a 3gpp standard

467
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,767
I told you there was going to be a lot acronym

468
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
What's a cellular standard

469
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
It competes

470
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
With

471
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,679
Hello Kitty mess it up again cat

472
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
So

473
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,639
The reason I'm bringing this up is because Verizon

474
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,687
In the US is doing a cat in one

475
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,735
So you're going to hear about it

476
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:09,087
And it's going to compete with some of the other networks out there like Comcast just invested in

477
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Lauren

478
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
So when you hear cat and one

479
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
Or nb-iot

480
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Tink

481
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
That competes with

482
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
Lauren net

483
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Works or sick Fox

484
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,375
All these are kind of these low-power wide-area

485
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,959
So what's happening here is Singapore

486
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:30,335
Australia and Korean telcos are trialling nb-iot

487
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,127
What's also worth noting

488
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,431
Thing is that Singapura Korea both have

489
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
Lauren net

490
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Brexit there were

491
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Time to

492
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,111
So it's unclear to me at the carrier's think that Laura and the cellular standards

493
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
Compatible

494
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
And I might be

495
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,463
I'm running them together Verizon is

496
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
Not

497
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Investing in

498
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,071
Up the carriers here in the US are like

499
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,911
Worth noting just a

500
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,447
If your if your network nerd

501
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
You can be like oh my God

502
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
More acronyms

503
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,359
More fun more standards more Networks

504
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,967
Finally if you have $300 to spend

505
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,063
Netatmo has an outdoor camera just for you

506
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,159
So this is part of the

507
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Just

508
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Rush

509
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:22,816
Of outdoor cameras we've got the canary Flex we've got the ring stick up cam

510
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
Forget exactly what is collecting that's right though

511
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,984
Is descriptive names they really hot problems

512
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:36,384
All right so all of those cameras Bay all range in about 200 maybe $250

513
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
Try to think about the canary Flex

514
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
But the netatmo

515
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
IS300

516
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,320
And this is a camera

517
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,368
Outdoor camera + security light

518
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,696
So the camera is beneath this big LED light

519
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:54,560
You install it outside by installing it where a security light had been

520
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,888
So it gets power that way so there's a little bit of wiring involved

521
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,216
The reason it cost so much put it at

522
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
Is because they don't

523
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,056
Actually store your stuff to the cloud

524
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:09,920
And so there's no subscription so they're arguing that over there a year

525
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,224
Your product is actually about the same

526
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,576
Which for the nest outdoor I guess it's $10 a month so

527
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:21,440
In about a year you make that up because your story on a internal micro SD card so

528
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,024
You can store an internal micro SD card which is what 90% of

529
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
People will probably do

530
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,096
The others can put it onto a

531
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,376
Internal Nas

532
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
Ntp server

533
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,984
Or you can send it to Dropbox actually just met

534
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,312
Is also integrated with if this then that

535
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
And

536
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:43,200
What I like about that at most stuff other than the Privacy features is that it's got

537
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,736
Really interesting

538
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,064
Image recognition technology so it can tell if it's a dog

539
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,856
This car has all these other things

540
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,648
And it won't record that stuff

541
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
If you don't want to

542
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,232
If you want without the noise I like that

543
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
Yes

544
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,792
So Nest also does that

545
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,864
Canary is working on that I don't know how effective it is

546
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,680
So in the nest stuff actually looks pretty good at it so

547
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
Basically

548
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,032
This is up to you if your privacy-conscious I would say

549
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
This is a good per

550
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
If you

551
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,664
Are compatible with nest and you have a bunch of that stuff maybe you don't spend

552
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,200
An extra hundred dollars on the net

553
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
There you have it

554
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,016
New devices

555
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Available

556
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
For you

557
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
And now

558
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Stay tuned

559
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,928
For a message from our sponsor

560
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
And

561
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,768
Our Guest this week who is Brian nox

562
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,424
The head of security research at new star and he's talking about security

563
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Turn that up

564
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,544
That was just super fun to say all right

565
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,104
Thank you so much de to

566
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,504
Hey this is Stacy I'm breaking into this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor

567
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,088
Sponsors arm and I have dipesh Patel

568
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:59,488
Use arms EVP of incubation businesses earlier about secure

569
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
Charity being the biggest problem

570
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,816
Facing the Internet of Things

571
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,144
Armistead a lot of work with trustzone on its chips

572
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
It's crypto cell technology

573
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,496
And you guys recently launched another

574
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
Architecture

575
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
That will help

576
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,080
Secure even smaller

577
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
Devices

578
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,504
But you guys also did something really significant you launched a cloud service can you talk about why that happened

579
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,320
Did you know that biggest challenge facing us in

580
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,112
Connected devices

581
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,160
How do we make sure that the devices

582
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
A secure

583
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,488
And I managed to the life cycle

584
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:37,120
Let me explain what I mean by Manish first and then I'll talk about how the cloud offering that we have launched

585
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
Touching that to Jenny

586
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,960
So every device is best

587
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
Installed

588
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
In a environment

589
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
It has a

590
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,872
Needs to be unloaded and then it needs to be managed

591
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,968
To its life cycle and device management important

592
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,528
But one of the biggest issues with device

593
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,600
She's at the software that one has written for those devices

594
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
Tends to evolve over time

595
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,184
And you might have

596
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
Issues with

597
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,512
Versions of software that you wanted

598
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:10,400
Some of these issues with lead to security holes in the devices and in order for us to manage.

599
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
Do spices

600
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:17,312
To the lifecycle we need to be able to have those devices connected to a cloud service and be able to deploy

601
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
Different software update To ghost device

602
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:24,736
As part of that deployment this is where you bring into brand new and bet Cloud offering

603
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,296
And that's what I meant cloud is designed to

604
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,856
Text design to take the device

605
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,928
To a journey from the first time it's connected

606
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,512
2 to the time that we can actively manage the devices

607
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
In the field

608
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,584
With mbed cloud

609
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
An embedded OS

610
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,424
You guys are really branching out from

611
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
Silicon IP

612
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:49,056
Can you talk about the overall strategy for arm and why it's doing

613
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,616
As we started looking at iot

614
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,664
It became clear to us that the

615
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
So is 82 units

616
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,272
Scale and become mainstream

617
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,856
We were going to have to do something about the software that fan on device

618
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,696
At the moment the software that runs on devices is quite fragmented

619
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,512
And why that's okay from the volume Zello

620
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:13,120
In order to scale to a large-scale number of devices

621
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
That's Amore

622
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,216
Like the one we're doing with him by the West was necessary

623
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,520
And that was necessary because we think

624
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,056
A lot of the colon problems

625
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,080
I don't device

626
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,128
Software needed to dissolve

627
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
In one hit

628
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,200
And that everybody could take advantage of that

629
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,736
And spend their time and effort

630
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
On

631
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,040
Creating additional apps

632
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
Medications that ran on that sofa

633
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,112
Depeche thank you

634
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,184
I can't wait to see what happens where can we go to

635
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
To find out

636
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
Directions to Glen lawn mower parts

637
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
Is

638
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Embed

639
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
Dot-com

640
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,096
That's the letter m

641
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,376
Followed by

642
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,656
Bed

643
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,424
Dot-com

644
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,240
You can talk more about MBH cloud

645
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
And by the way

646
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,824
Weather in America

647
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
Device manufacturer

648
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,408
Oh what are you looking to manage

649
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:03,808
Devices that are about to be deployed and in the field

650
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:10,208
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacy Higgins

651
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,768
Today's guest is Brian up

652
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,608
Who is the director of security research for iot

653
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
At

654
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
New star

655
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,936
Hi Brian

656
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,728
Good thank you for having me

657
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,776
Thanks for coming on the show

658
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
So you are here

659
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,360
Because you have spent years

660
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,920
An industry that feels like it's only a few years old

661
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:34,272
You actually spent years doing security research for companies like Belkin and wink

662
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,856
And then you work with Josh Gorman over it I am the cavalry

663
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
Helping to create some

664
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
Frameworks for

665
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,696
Connected devices

666
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
For securing

667
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
So

668
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,816
I really excited to have you

669
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,120
Well let's get started

670
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
So

671
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,776
Right now we're in kind of what feels like a turning point for conversations about Security in the internet

672
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,824
Things we've kind friend

673
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:02,944
Deers about like hacking individual devices to all of a sudden we've had these major

674
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,736
Distributed denial-of-service attack

675
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,296
Text the most recent one happened

676
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:11,136
Friday and basically took down a couple actually

677
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,208
It can take down a couple websites but it affected

678
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
Websites on East Coast

679
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,816
And I would love to get your take

680
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:26,240
Did you expect this to be the Hallmark event or this type of attack to be the Hallmark event that got people talking about securing Iowa

681
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
Are we expecting

682
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,872
You know this kind of attack or just ready to start general service

683
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:38,016
Not necessarily distributed-denial-of-service but we were expecting these kind of attacks to be coming from iot devices

684
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,576
Because the security has really been locked

685
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856
Such a long time

686
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,416
And the sheer number of these devices out

687
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,440
On the market

688
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:50,816
Gartner says there's 5.5 million devices per day that are that are put on the internet

689
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,352
It's a lot of devices

690
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
With very little security

691
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,960
That are just right for being used for attacks

692
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,776
Okay and when you said these kinds of attacks

693
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,312
What kind of attacks

694
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,152
What's this is a very different type of

695
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
What we've seen with

696
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
A normal

697
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,016
You know distributed-denial-of-service

698
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:14,112
Those typically Army send you a message to your computer or your device

699
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:17,184
And then it sends a request to somewhere that I've spooked

700
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,256
And what's really different about this kind of attack

701
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
What we saw on Friday

702
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,584
Is it used What's called the Mirai botnet

703
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
And that's it

704
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
Set of iot devices

705
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
They've captured

706
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,960
But instead of

707
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,240
Sending the request

708
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,264
Chi without devices

709
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,032
Making it

710
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
Trigger point there

711
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,360
They compromised all these devices directly

712
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,920
So they loaded malware on all these devices

713
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:43,040
And once these devices can infected they actually start searching for other devices

714
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,088
And there's a huge number of

715
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,624
Credentials that are

716
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
Store Dress Code

717
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,696
And so it's looking for

718
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:55,072
I will call NVR Network video recorders which is kind of like a DVR but for

719
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,144
It'll be connected cameras the cameras themselves

720
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,728
And then a small percentage about 4% we're actually router

721
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,264
Charlie's device

722
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,080
Cyst with a lot of power very little security were used to

723
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,872
Basically load this attack

724
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,456
Transdyne which is a Dynamic DNS provider

725
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
And

726
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
All the sites

727
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
Use dying

728
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,832
We are unable to resolve their

729
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
IP address

730
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
So what does that mean for consumer

731
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,232
When you were trying to get a Twitter and

732
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,512
Other sites

733
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,048
Sonosite

734
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
Become unavailable

735
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
Got it

736
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,680
This is a specific Port that is used for a certain time

737
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,704
Type of traffic signs

738
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,544
I'm going to nerd out for a minute here and we're going to talk about

739
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,080
The hotel nataska

740
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,616
And why

741
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
That's actually like

742
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,944
A good thing because

743
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,272
Well that's not so much that concerning me the problem with

744
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,064
Telnet is telnet is White Oak

745
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
Internet

746
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,160
Support 23 it's been around for a long time

747
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
In a lot of places

748
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
Suspend

749
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,536
Replace with a much more secure than called SSH

750
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,864
But the problem is that a lot of these devices

751
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,144
Wenger Manufacturing

752
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
Turn on telnet

753
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,704
Phone number

754
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:11,616
A lot of times they are used to telnet into the box so it's a terminal window you know For Those whom

755
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,152
Remember the old black-and-white windows

756
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,504
And once you get a tone at session you can actually look at settings

757
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:22,112
And so manufactured Jesus off the assembly line 2

758
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,416
Put things like the serial number

759
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,768
Set the MAC address at the IP address so they can actually program these devices

760
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,328
Unfortunately that means that a lot of times

761
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:36,704
Those devices never have toenail turned off

762
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,056
If 90% of the consumers aren't going to use that feature it shouldn't be on

763
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,616
Left of 10% that need it actually

764
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,408
Turn on telnet and use it

765
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
The other problem here

766
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:51,296
Which is more concerning is the password or that the credentials for telnet

767
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:57,184
The issue with a lot of these prices from Ryan back to all these places is there using default credentials

768
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
Which means he's

769
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,744
I wish credentials

770
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,048
Better in the user guides and

771
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,096
Document on the web for devices

772
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,680
And they're weak credentials things like all zero

773
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
Or admin admin

774
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,264
And so they're very easy to gas

775
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,592
So what Mariah does is it scans for

776
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
Devices

777
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
List of credentials

778
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,688
And they're all default credentials

779
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
And

780
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,272
One socket connection to telnet

781
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,808
It loads up malware

782
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,136
And then makes that device start searching on other devices

783
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,928
The problem you have here is

784
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,000
If a user goes into the web interface

785
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,328
Right just like their configuring router and they change the password

786
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,168
In many of these cases it does not change the tone at password

787
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:44,800
In some cases that toilet password is hard-coded which means you as user cannot change it

788
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,616
Got it which is why some of the

789
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,664
Are one of the vendors at least so far his

790
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
Recalled

791
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
Some of their devices

792
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,016
And that's a huge step that we shouldn't

793
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,552
Ignore I mean

794
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
To have a vendor

795
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,112
Find any record

796
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
Is it Theory have

797
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,976
Put such improper security into the device

798
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,792
But they need to recall it because they can't actually fix it

799
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
That's a big deal

800
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,120
And that picture vendor

801
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,680
The problem is there a white-label vendor

802
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
Which means

803
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,288
They're not selling their DVRs or their NPR's under their name

804
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,824
They're showing it to other manufacturer

805
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,360
So

806
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,664
That seem NVR kits sold to

807
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
10 or 15 different

808
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,224
Manufacturers

809
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,552
Then put their sticker on it and sell it with her cameras

810
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:32,416
Does that mean Isaac consumer have no idea if I've got one of these or does that mean

811
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,976
Those vendors that are at the actual

812
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,280
Brands need to do a recall

813
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
Well

814
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,608
I think one the coordinate through

815
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,632
The vendors that they were

816
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:48,288
But you as a consumer you can look at the Mirai list if you just Google for a Mirai botnet there's a list of the device

817
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,336
And manufacturers that are affected

818
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
Yes

819
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,432
That is true and what what if one of my devices is on this

820
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
What do I do

821
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,736
This is really where

822
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,016
Choices of consumers

823
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,320
Amanda cases

824
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,624
You can try and change the password

825
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:08,512
Look up the user manual to see if etenet password or the interface password can be changed

826
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
And if it can't

827
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
Then I would

828
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Consider

829
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,376
Either removing that device

830
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,168
And buy replacement

831
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,216
We're contacting you manufacturer

832
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:21,056
Tell me the manufacturers have said they will be doing a software update

833
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
To change the

834
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,920
What is that means they're going to do another default password that someone

835
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,944
Figure out

836
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Not sure

837
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,784
But if they just change the password to something else

838
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,832
Once people figure out that password

839
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,904
Unless every customer is changing their password to

840
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Unique one

841
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,720
It's just going to be another way to attack

842
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,560
So the need to change their passwords

843
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,864
And enable consumers to

844
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
Change the past

845
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:50,240
Actually they just need to enable consumers to change their passwords and then consumer protection

846
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
Exactly

847
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
Got it

848
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,592
How likely is that

849
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,896
Well I would say normally

850
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,920
Not very likely

851
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
For a couple

852
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
1

853
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,064
You're assuming that the manufacturers actually have a contact

854
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,368
List of everyone who owns this device

855
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,696
So unless you register your device with an a

856
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
Account

857
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
Which song

858
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
Some of these

859
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,816
They don't have a way to contact them

860
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,608
Even if A2

861
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,424
It requires the user to actually do the interaction

862
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,008
So the manufacturer will come up with the new update

863
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
But they don't cash it out

864
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
It's cold down by the consumer

865
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
And this is part of the problem with IRT

866
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,712
We're asking average consumers to become it patching

867
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,248
Apartments

868
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,576
You know what you think of all the devices your house that may be connected

869
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:41,952
I have to go look for updates for each one of those and make sure you update them on a regular basis

870
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:45,024
Well this seems like a good time to talk about like things that

871
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,352
Companies can do to design security into their devices

872
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,912
Cuz a lot of my devices

873
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,216
Actually Force updates to me

874
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
And so

875
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
Patching for

876
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,544
For me it's just

877
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
Open app

878
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,336
And it's like hey

879
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,104
Firmware update

880
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
Do it

881
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,944
Or in some cases it's like boom

882
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
We updated yourself

883
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
Enjoy

884
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:12,672
I guess just this feels like something the vendor should be kind of thinking about when they're designing I mean isn't it possible to make this easier

885
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
Consumers

886
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
It's absolutely posh

887
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,328
Make it easier for consumers unfortunately security is one of the last things

888
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,192
I mean if you think of like a Kickstarter or Indiegogo type campaign

889
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,728
You're trying to get funding

890
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,384
And then you're building a team and you've got to build a mobile app and you better build the web interface in the actual product and the soft

891
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,456
So the nvrs are being provided

892
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,504
Many of these cases by a

893
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
White label manufacturer

894
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,832
But there's a lot of

895
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,624
Kickstart projects

896
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,440
Or cameras something that you need

897
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
Where

898
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,768
They may have to build the software for it

899
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,048
Or the

900
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,328
Firmware for it

901
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,632
Or they get part of the firmware for the manufacturer

902
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,912
But they're not fully

903
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,936
Thinking about security

904
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,984
From the manufacturer standpoint

905
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
Yashow Whiteley

906
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
Axure

907
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:04,384
They don't really think of the software layer so much as a firmware

908
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:09,760
And they provide that to whoever the eventual manufacturer who's going to put their name on it

909
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:14,112
So if there's not a you know starting approach of

910
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,184
Thinking about how you think you want to scare the product

911
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,000
It's too late once you get the device already you know down to

912
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
Consumer

913
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,816
And the last time I see

914
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:27,168
Is the tools that are used to it as I talked about before they're used to

915
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,216
Verify the product off the assembly

916
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
A lot of time

917
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,336
Actual vulnerabilities are in those tools themselves

918
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,384
And again they're used to do things like

919
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
Verify that

920
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,992
IP address is set correctly the serial number

921
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,272
And the MAC address

922
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
But those

923
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
Schools

924
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,368
Also have things like

925
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,904
Route show access or

926
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
Donut open

927
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,768
The manufacturers do this for

928
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Convenience

929
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,072
They don't think like attacker

930
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
So

931
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,656
The manufacturer doesn't know it's there

932
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,496
What we call the original development manufacturer the person

933
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
Who makes it

934
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
Doesn't

935
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,080
Care that it's there because it's

936
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,360
Convenient for them

937
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,432
And most consumers window to check for those things

938
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,968
Or even how to check for those

939
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,272
And so the solution

940
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,368
If I'm a consumer and I want to buy products that are not going to

941
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,904
Become part of a button

942
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,488
Or are less likely to be compromised in other ways

943
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,536
What should I look for what should I do

944
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
So I think

945
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,912
Easiest thing for consumers to do is look up the manufacturer website

946
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,960
And see if they have a security light

947
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
And that's going to tell you a couple

948
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
1

949
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
Whether or not the company action

950
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,848
We take security seriously

951
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,944
To whether they have a bug Bounty program or way to submit

952
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,712
Information

953
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,736
If there is a problem

954
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,576
And those things alone tell you that they actually care about security

955
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,136
If there's no way to get to the manufacturer

956
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,952
About a security issue

957
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,256
10 if a researcher finds vulnerability

958
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,072
They're not going to have a way to get to the manufacturer

959
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,376
And it probably means a manufactured doesn't

960
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
And this is scary

961
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,288
There's a lot of opportunity for things to go wrong here and it feels like not a lot of

962
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,568
Ways to fix it

963
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,104
After the fact

964
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,384
So

965
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
Given that

966
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
What is your stand sign

967
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:19,808
Like what should we be doing should we should the government get involved in b-more

968
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,856
You know stick less carrot

969
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,136
Should

970
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,952
I don't know consumers just give up stop buying the stuff

971
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:30,048
What consumers really should be doing is using their buying power

972
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,584
To incentivize

973
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,144
Steel manufacturers who do care about you

974
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,704
There are manufacturers out there that

975
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
Run bug bounty

976
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:43,616
Set have Security Programs that are constantly looking to improve the security devices

977
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,176
So what about the governor

978
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:50,272
The interesting thing about the government is whether they have the power to you

979
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,808
Actually go after

980
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:59,232
Over the past couple years there have been some actions taken by the FTC against companies that are implementing what we

981
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Sitter

982
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,792
Basic minimum standards

983
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,120
It happen against camera companies have happened against router

984
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,168
Unfortunately

985
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,448
They're larger company

986
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,008
With very large legal team set of fought back in

987
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,544
In one even when they

988
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
Violated

989
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,872
What anyone in the security industry worth

990
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,664
Would consider a basic minimum

991
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,736
An example would be a router with lap

992
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:24,832
And wife is a standard that has been for many years advised not to be

993
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,160
And there was a router manufacturer

994
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,696
ISP

995
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,232
Who is shipping devices

996
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
With back pain is

997
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,328
And after she went after them

998
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,632
And unfortunately lost because

999
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,960
Lawyers of this company were

1000
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
Substantial

1001
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,776
Where is most of the

1002
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:48,640
Companies like that that that BC went after ended up paying fines for having two

1003
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,176
Fixter devices

1004
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
So

1005
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,760
I think it's that's one way to do it

1006
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:59,136
I just don't see right now that the FTC necessarily has the power they need

1007
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,672
Be able to horses

1008
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,976
So maybe this is where we look at other

1009
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,304
There's an effort for something called cyber UL

1010
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,864
If she works better with Underwriters Laboratory

1011
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,680
This would be a cyber version of it that would look at

1012
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,960
Border Collie puppies

1013
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,752
There's an effort

1014
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,056
That I'm working on with I'm the calvary

1015
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,592
That is doing something

1016
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,432
Similar to ones that the Cowboys release

1017
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,224
It's a five star rating for

1018
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,504
Devices

1019
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,064
And similar to what you would see with a car

1020
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:31,904
The consumers don't necessarily need to know all the tests that are behind it

1021
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,232
But that a five-star would be much better than a 3-star

1022
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,280
And that program would be run by

1023
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,328
Government companies

1024
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,144
We wouldn't necessarily want the government to run it

1025
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,448
Probably more like an independent company

1026
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,008
But think of it as a framework for researchers to

1027
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:51,360
Use so that they can talk about devices in a Common Language

1028
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,384
Every

1029
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,455
Researcher you know goes to look at a device and

1030
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,015
Has sort of different ways of looking at it judging

1031
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,295
How good that

1032
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
Practice

1033
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
Compared to other cameras

1034
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,391
Compared to other devices

1035
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,671
If we had a common frame

1036
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,463
A way to rate these devices

1037
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,999
Or how they handle

1038
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:08,767
Physical

1039
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,303
How they handled

1040
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,839
Network communication

1041
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,607
How they handled

1042
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,375
Privacy

1043
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,911
How they handle safety

1044
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,471
I feel like we have talked about a lot of things

1045
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:22,079
I would love to know from your perspective you give me some good tips about where to go and how to

1046
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,615
Judge devices

1047
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
Before I fall

1048
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,431
The ones I have now

1049
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:31,039
Do you have any advice for people who have a collection of

1050
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,111
Connected devices in maybe there fine for now

1051
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,415
How should I be kind of thinking about

1052
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,439
Protecting myself

1053
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
I think it's a taco

1054
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:44,095
Before looking at the manufacture sightseeing if they're serious about security

1055
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,631
There are number of

1056
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,703
Defcon presentations that have been done on iOS device

1057
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
They're all on YouTube

1058
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,079
And unfortunately a lot of those manufacturers

1059
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:57,151
Don't care or have never followed up to 60 issues

1060
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,943
These are things like

1061
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
Being able to

1062
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:04,319
Call your home and then having someone who can just

1063
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,599
Connect to that device

1064
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,391
Load their own software on it

1065
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
And

1066
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
Really do whatever they want

1067
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:15,327
Many of these devices are used for managing remote compsych rental helps

1068
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,887
In the past there has been problems with

1069
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,935
Companies like Mikasa Verde

1070
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,215
Are they have a devices

1071
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,239
The Gateway for your home

1072
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,055
And it has very little security

1073
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,639
There's a lot of YouTube videos explaining how to hack into him

1074
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,967
And so is a consumer you have to make a choice on

1075
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:36,831
Just the benefit you're getting from that device outweigh the risks of someone

1076
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,391
Using that device to unlock your home

1077
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,927
There are manufactured

1078
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,975
As I said that you care about security

1079
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,023
If you look at Google

1080
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,559
They spend a lot of time

1081
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,863
Security now whether you have a problem

1082
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,143
The way they handle privacy

1083
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,679
Is a different story

1084
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
But

1085
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,751
They do spend a lot of time on the security devices

1086
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,359
Do you want to recommend any devices that are highly secure for us

1087
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,663
There are a lot of spice I like

1088
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,967
There's companies that I feel take a lot

1089
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,271
Kerin

1090
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,807
Their approach to security

1091
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,599
But because I work on bug bounty

1092
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,623
Crisis actor

1093
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,159
Be very careful what I say

1094
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,951
I will say publicly that

1095
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,487
You know I like the products

1096
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,511
Dictionary has done

1097
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
I think they take a very

1098
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,095
Serious approach to security

1099
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
I believe the same with wink

1100
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:27,775
I feel like it's a great platform to bring a lot of your iot devices together especially from the consumer standpoint

1101
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,311
Google has done a lot

1102
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,335
This pretty space

1103
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,919
Whether you have an issue again about their privacy

1104
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,479
Their products tend to be very solid whiskey

1105
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,247
Prospective

1106
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,343
Those aren't the three that come to mind I actually have about a hundred iot device

1107
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
She's in my lap at home

1108
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:46,719
How did I work on a daily basis and that means lots of applications

1109
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,767
Looking at lots of traffic

1110
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,791
To see how those

1111
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
Devices work

1112
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,143
Is that your home or is that your lab that is also

1113
00:44:55,423 --> 00:45:00,799
My home is actually a giant lab everything in my home is connected from my swimming pool

1114
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,615
Turn my thermostat to my door locks

1115
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,895
Now there are some

1116
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,687
Protections like firewalls

1117
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,223
Things put in place in front of it

1118
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,015
Because I'm a researcher

1119
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:15,391
Part of my research has to be using these on a daily basis to understand

1120
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,695
The benefit versus security trade off

1121
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
I love it

1122
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,279
I also live in a living lab so I'm like

1123
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,303
One day

1124
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,839

1125
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
