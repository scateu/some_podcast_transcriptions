Lots of rumors about Echo and things

16
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,008
Become

17
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,544
Some issues with Google home

A new smart home Gateway

19
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,128
Brand new first-time home

20
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,176
My experience with

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:50,944
Homekit

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,272
And an update on my time with Lutron and SmartThings

23
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
Things try to get that too

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,344

It's an agricultural company based in Australia and she talks about things like

27
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,280
How did you

28
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048
Data-sharing

29
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,840
And making money off of

30
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,144
So it's got to be a good interview

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
You stick around

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824
And now a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Wolf SSL

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
The world's top 5 Industrial Automation companies use SSL to secure everything from Factory floor

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
Devices to their power beaters and they aren't alone

Connected home

37
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512

Military and medical device

39
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,888
Places with the Mirai botnet and the growing threat of ransomware attacks on the

40
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,192
The Internet of Things companies have to pay attention to

41
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,728
UTI medication

42
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,032
Bad PR and their brand value

43
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
Securing the iot

44
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:53,408
It's hard but wolf SSL has experienced a specialized

To find out more visit wolf ssl.com

47
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
Well let's just get right into

48
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
Because

49
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Got a lot of new

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
So first up that everyone

51
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
Probably think

52
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
Is

53
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
The CIA

54
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
Hacking

55
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,680
Well all kinds of stuff so they were Revelations this week that the

56
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,496
He has a program to hack

57
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
Smart TVs

58
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,336
And a bunch of other devices

59
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,640
And I thought of this and I was like oh my God

60
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,736
Yes it is true that I thought it was the NSA but it's really the CIA

61
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Probably listening

62
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576
So what do you think about this guy

63
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,416
I think that

64
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:41,280
As long as you got cameras on our phones and microphones on our phones and computers and

65
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,448
Stability idea of cameras and microphones on their body and their home

66
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Smart model

67
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
But

68
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,944
Tortas Ya

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
Not just a Samsung

70
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,040
Specific

71
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
Confirmed

72
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
La Santa Cecilia isn't confirming anything but

73
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,232
I don't think it's a stretch to assume that the CIA is going to

74
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,048
Microphones in

75
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,400
Cameras inside

76
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,312
Probably

77
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,360
Cameras and microphones in their home in general

78
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,456
Because I think the

79
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,040
So I don't know that there are really strong guidelines

80
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
People are aware of the people

81
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:41,952
When it comes to devices in their home and in what the government is capable of what

82
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
Just got a new frontier that

83
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,816
People are figuring out as they go

84
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,656
That hasn't dissuaded people from buying devices that have microphones and cameras

85
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
I would remind people

86
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,544
Not to commit crimes

87
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,872
In front of their Amazon Echo or they're smart television

88
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
For example

89
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,992
There is the case of we brought this up before

90
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
Cut the hot tub murder

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
Scandalous

92
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,416
This is a murder investigation actually that the police

93
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
They were seeking the suspects

94
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,303
Amazon Echo files because they wanted to understand who was in the home

95
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
At the time

96
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
And Amazon was fighting this

97
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,935
Which good for them rightly so

98
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,007
Saying it was over reach there other ways to get that info

99
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
Formation

100
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
And

101
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
What happened

102
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,871
Now is that

103
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,431
Suspect basically agreed to let Amazon

104
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
Pass those files

105
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
So

106
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:42,367
The good news is Amazon was really into fight the bad news is we don't actually we're not going to get a legal opinion anytime

107
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
Time soon

108
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Weather this is

109
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,975
Prosecutorial overreach or

110
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Legit

111
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,583
What's a really good point I think and

112
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
Sort of interesting

113
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
In terms of

114
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,239
Didn't hear you know that Amazon was going to turn it over after

115
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Suspect gave the okay

116
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,151
I wonder if the conspiracy theorist in my young

117
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
Could someone use the Amazon Echo to create an alibi

118
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:14,111
You know could you sort of second voice command remotely or something somehow trick the echo to thinking that your home while you're out committing a crime and

119
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
And tell the police

120
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Turn the lights off

121
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
Go ahead Amazon show

122
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,815
So I guess it's interesting

123
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,375
Tac being kind of ahead of where the zeitgeist

124
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,935
I like the way

125
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Oh

126
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,335
Alright on the topic of the Echo Man

127
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
Are worse

128
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Medi

129
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Rumors

130
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
You actually put out

131
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
Moments of brilliance

132
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,415
We'll call it this is the Amazon tap

133
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
No longer being

134
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
Red-headed stepchild of the

135
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
Echo family

136
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,119
And so I'm assuming you're talking about

137
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
And take it with you and still be able to

138
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
Hands-free

139
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Chatting to

140
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
Yeah yeah

141
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
Point spread

142
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
Before you couldn't even

143
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,575
Activated remotely

144
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
Now you can say

145
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:26,303
Awkward wake it up and use it just like an echo

146
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,423
I'm not quite as strong as the echo is

147
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,495
So as a middle ground between those two

148
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,479
You can't do with the echo or the echo. I think it's going to be a pretty intriguing option going for it I'm kind of curious to see what happen

149
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:51,647
People get the memo that that the are the top in a lot better now and will see it'll be interesting

150
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
So

151
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:57,279
Now this raises the question should I buy a tap which cuz I I feel like my home

152
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
I don't have enough of them

153
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
So I'm like should I buy the

154
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
Or should I hang

155
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,495
Tight for a little bit because rumors last

156
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,311
Where the Amazons going to unveil some

157
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,871
She Who Shall Not Be Named power devices

158
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,431
That will allow you to initiate

159
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Calls using Voice

160
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,759
And it could also work as an intercom

161
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Comp system

162
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
And this is from Rico

163
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,903
And I'll be honest I was actually following the story so I

164
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Believe that this is

165
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Totally accurate

166
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
So

167
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
Should people wait

168
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
That's a good question

169
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Especially if I already had him

170
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:40,287
Echo or Echo dot access to Amazon cloud services

171
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,359
I'll be stealing at my home with extra devices

172
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
Just right now it's just

173
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
Kind of the perfect

174
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
Bad time to do it

175
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
Because there are so many rumors out there

176
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
Beltone call functionality rumors

177
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,951
Also talk of media camera

178
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:02,815
That might be voice activated in some way there was a week images that someone found

179
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:06,655
Lycoming through Amazon.com of a camera that looks a little bit like

180
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,703
The canary Flex a little table top camera

181
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,799
With a very familiar blue ring around the lens so

182
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
Yeah I don't know that

183
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,407
We're going to want to rush into a product like that that is so

184
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
ISO camera Focus

185
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,551
Especially in light of everything going on in the news so different

186
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
Expand what they've done so far

187
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,927
And I will have a fun time seeing what actually comes to comes to life

188
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
What are your

189
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Favorite features

190
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
I'm assuming

191
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:40,447
I do yeah yeah I was one of the lucky ones that got one of the discounted ones in the very beginning at 7 to pay tobruk

192
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
Yeah I was so happy

193
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
Iran time I felt like I was a winner

194
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,711
Turn lights on and off my lifx bulbs that work really well with it

195
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:58,111
Check the weather every morning on my way out the door you know I ask for music all the time through Spotify

196
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
It's just a convenient

197
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
Neat little piece of the future

198
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
But yeah there's definitely a lot more of that

199
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
It could do and I'm kind of excited to see what comes there could be some really big steps

200
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Olympics

201
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,703
The intercom feature because

202
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,495
We put things around the house

203
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
I guess I have to re-up my

204
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
Speaking of hard

205
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,735
Since we're talking about these with Bruce Sterling once on my podcast called talking donkeys

206
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,759
I kind of like that phrase

207
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
Google home

208
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,415
I don't know if you have one but I do and it stopped

209
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
Working for me this week

210
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,559
I went over to CNET and lo and behold they had a lovely story explaining that I was not alone

211
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,863
That other people were having this issue

212
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,591
First came out and then I didn't feel the need to pick up a Google home but we do have

213
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
Peanut smart home as well

214
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,223
Places about

215
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,063
Difficulties with Google home that it kind of been bubbling the last month or so

216
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:05,439
Especially with Google home controlling Philips hue light bulbs I'm not sure if you were using it for that in your home

217
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
People that

218
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
Work

219
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
That have no problems with the Google home otherwise

220
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:14,399
Or just totally unable to control their lights is really weird

221
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Performer when it comes

222
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,239
Smart lighting so that that was sort of

223
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
Eyebrows

224
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
Verizon

225
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,639
Because we're not able to replicate the issue on our end

226
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
Able to confirm that sun

227
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,711
Users are crazy

228
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,271
How cold is right now and just put only tell us that they're working on

229
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,111
I am one of those users who had issues and

230
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Actually last

231
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
For 2 days

232
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
These cloud dependencies

233
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
A huge number

234
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
People listen to the shower

235
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,863
Probably right now are gleefully playing it

236
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,775
So it was remarkably opaque and that was actually really frustrating

237
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
As a user

238
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,359
Because I did go online and I saw a lake

239
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
I saw it

240
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
Couple issues but Google's help was not

241
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
So

242
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
What is happening

243
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,599
Yeah I know I think that the frustration

244
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:10,207
People have a really telling the really indicative of how much people enjoy and

245
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Come to rely on using

246
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
Voice control Platforms in their home

247
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,751
Unplugging the router and plugging it back in

248
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:36,319
And they've already come this thing that you know when the clock goes down to get frustrated but that's just sort of the way it is

249
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,111
I don't know that makes Amazon like

250
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,695
Time Warner Cable cable company of the future but but we'll see

251
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
I think there's

252
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
Actually this spring.

253
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
So I have a question for you

254
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,167
Because my Google home is in my master bath

255
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
And I love talking to it when

256
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
When I'm in the shower

257
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Play music

258
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
What's the weather for the day

259
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,103
News for the day all of this stuff

260
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
It was kind of chilly here

261
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
And I was

262
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Oh

263
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
I should totally hook up

264
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
My little shower heaters

265
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
Have a little

266
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
Heater light heater fan thing

267
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
For my

268
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,463
I forgot to turn it on and I was like I'm not getting out of the shower

269
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
Water everywhere is like

270
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
Slightly warmer bathroom

271
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
When I get out but

272
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,447
This is a perfect use case for the smart home because I can be there and say

273
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
Google turn on

274
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
What

275
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,359
Do you recommend or are there

276
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,967
Switches cuz I I don't want to stick like a normal switch on my

277
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,527
Heater fan because I feel like that's probably a different

278
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
Different device

279
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
Do you have any recommendations there any knowledge about

280
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
I got Standalone Appliance

281
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,535
Heater that you plug in or is it true

282
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
It's in the ceiling

283
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,143
If you hit the button on a little

284
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
Warming sand

285
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,775
It's just a basic on off switch

286
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:09,247
You can use a Smart Switch to turn a ceiling fan

287
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
Smart Switch

288
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
Should be able to handle so you can use

289
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Belkin WeMo light switch

290
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
Pretty sure is Google home compatible

291
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,975
Imo's products and

292
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
A lot of smart switches coming out this

293
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,839
CES in January

294
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:29,727
So I'll ask him more often hopefully the coming months but right now if you want to do it I'd say Just Go With It WeMo light switch

295
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,775
OC I was going to go with

296
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
Can I go with the Lutron

297
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,335
But that's just

298
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
Okay

299
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,943
But we were almost getting ahead of ourselves

300
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
Is the Segway Direction

301
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
You guys

302
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
All right

303
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
Before we go into some Lutron stuff

304
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,135
Jesus has a new smart home Gateway

305
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,231
And I looked at this and the first thing I saw was it didn't have

306
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
Z-Wave in it

307
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
And I was sad

308
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
Because I have a lot of

309
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Running around the house

310
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
And I also looked at it

311
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,191
Said holy cow it is a ring of

312
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,263
Light it looks like that GE Echo Power

313
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
Latex

314
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,783
See I don't know I feel like it's it looks a little too futuristic to go in my

315
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
It's not it's not a devices

316
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Yeah

317
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,231
Yeah I think that's a good point and I think that's smart

318
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
Figured out that line

319
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Certo

320
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,351
Between futuristic and inconspicuous

321
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
Probably in Arizona

322
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,727
Besides I think some people like Tech like that and some people don't

323
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
And you know it's the type of thing that

324
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,895
I think you could probably just hide behind your TV or wherever if you don't like the look of it

325
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
But yeah

326
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Dimensions of it but that ring

327
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
Looks looks

328
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,807
Pretty sizable as far as how to go

329
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,623
It looks so it's right next to in their Press paper

330
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
It's right next to

331
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
What they done is they've launched

332
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
The Gateway

333
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
And I should give you

334
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,559
Spax its support zigbee Bluetooth and WiFi

335
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,119
It manages all of the other Asus Smart Home

336
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,447
Isis soda can Outlets I got some sensors that got blocked

337
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,495
The guy that looks like a siren

338
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,311
And the Gateway is probably the size of their lot

339
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,223
And these are going to be launched on March 16

340
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
So not quite

341
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
There yet

342
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
I kind of feel like

343
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,415
Dear God do we need another

344
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:31,327
The first criticisms a lot of people will think of when they see it you know we already have

345
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
Several houses that are pretty well established

346
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
Point you know I think

347
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,959
Got a hard time catching up with wink and SmartThings

348
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,287
Not there for a while

349
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,103
Things you can do with it

350
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:49,503
This point is going to be a market mover I think people are looking for more devices and more things that can do things and actually have a tangible

351
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
Experience in their home

352
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
As opposed to devices that just

353
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Can control

354
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
But I don't know if you need

355
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:04,607
Give a little bit

356
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,911
Now I will say I think this would be cool

357
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,215
So Jesus also announce this was

358
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Hcso

359
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Xxv

360
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
Robots

361
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Zhengzhou

362
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,663
And that's actually being produced

363
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
You can actually buy it it's a

364
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,735
It's like $600 but

365
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:26,367
This is supposed to be a smart home robot and I think if you stuck all the smarts that are in the Gateway

366
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
Is it also does robot

367
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Things like

368
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,231
Talk to your kids and reach them

369
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Dancing

370
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,559
Headed back companion robot idea

371
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
Crazy expensive

372
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,703
Compared to like just by spending like $100 on

373
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,567
I don't know I'm like everything in a hug

374
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,847
In a robot

375
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
We saw a couple things like that

376
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,991
CES this year I I don't know I think

377
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
I think that idea

378
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Very nips

379
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,671
Very much like a very specific kind of product

380
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
A lot of people

381
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
Wouldn't necessarily want

382
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
And there's any practical sort of

383
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,863
Questions about that informs of how to get rid your home of the upstairs

384
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,471
What you step on it what if your dog plays with it

385
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Pinchos

386
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
I like that you were the

387
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Practicality

388
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
All right

389
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
If you knew

390
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Small pieces

391
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,783
Your Nest Thermostat now has two Factor

392
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
To which I say

393
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
I mean it is good from a security

394
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,999
Prospective anytime you log in you're going to get two-factor you have the option of having to pee

395
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:41,631
But if I'm thinking about looking into all the devices in my house that I'm constantly logging in and out of four

396
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,679
Testing purposes or just

397
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
Something glitches out

398
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
I'm kind of like

399
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
Okay

400
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
That's a lot

401
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,103
And that ride you got

402
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Adelaine camera

403
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:59,807
Homekit compatible camera that will actually show you the seed directly in apple

404
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
On your iPhone

405
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,135
Onyx the D-Link omna

406
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,695
Which is just a freshly out

407
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,791
Reviews from

408
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
Who's our camera crew

409
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
And she wasn't totally whatever

410
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,191
Appreciated The View

411
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,543
Has a lot of the basic features done right but it was shocking

412
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
To me at least that there weren't more

413
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,895
Interesting things you can do with it because of the whole cake

414
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
You can't even pull up the Apple

415
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
Apple TV app

416
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Have to watch this

417
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
You can do that with an s

418
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,927
But this isn't the first Apple TV

419
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,279
You can't do a whole lot of things of it through home I think it just would have revealed that homekit

420
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
Despite having taken

421
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,351
Next step forward in the last 6 months

422
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
I still have work to do

423
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:51,775
Interesting experience that makes

424
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:56,127
Awesome and we'll talk about that in a minute but first we're going to talk about IBM and Salesforce

425
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Doing a

426
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
Partnership

427
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,223
This is on the industrial side you guys but

428
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,295
This is a portico day I partnership

429
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Where

430
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
Basically

431
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
Be human

432
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,415
Reading capabilities of Watson

433
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
Will be tied in with salesforce's

434
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Einstein

435
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
CRM

436
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,607
Basically what I thought was most interesting

437
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,167
About this is the fact that the two of them

438
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,959
Are not doing a revenue-sharing

439
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,007
They're actually just going to be

440
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
Cross-selling

441
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
And reselling

442
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,103
I thought this was interesting because

443
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,663
The way they've got this partnership structure there

444
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,991
Doing a reselling agreement

445
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,551
Agreement based on 10 of their algorithms and data that they

446
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
Are using for this

447
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
And

448
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
Because data is such a

449
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
Crucial element

450
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
How you

451
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
In The Internet of Things

452
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
I thought

453
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Man

454
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:52,191
I was hoping to see these big companies kind of start to model for us how we do these data sharing contract

455
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,007
But instead it seems like they're sidestepping the issue

456
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Entirely

457
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
Which might be smart

458
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,847
But it doesn't bode well

459
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
Personal startups

460
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
This one actually be

461
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
Real until

462
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
The end of the show

463
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
Headline generating stories

464
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
Testing time

465
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
Speaking of homekit

466
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
So

467
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
I've been trying

468
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,327
Come in as a non-apple user this is been Lake

469
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,887
I don't know this is like learning how to walk

470
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
Grits

471
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,191
My toes or something

472
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
Just feel so utterly for

473
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Foreign to me

474
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
But I've been giving it the old

475
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
College try

476
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,639
And I said everything up working with my

477
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
My phone and that was

478
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,551
It was so lovely I didn't feel like it was anything revolutionary it was super easy to set up

479
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Totally one at that

480
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,743
But I decided I wanted to create it I wanted to use the Elgato Eve motion sensor

481
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
Serta power my Hue Lights in

482
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Closet

483
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
Because my

484
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
My Hue motion sensor is actually a

485
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
I bet you do this

486
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
I needed to

487
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
Run it through the Apple TV

488
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,567
Or an iPad that sits in my house be

489
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Because

490
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
When my phone is out otherwise it

491
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
This was my challenge

492
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,271
My iPhone is registered to me

493
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,575
The iPad that lives in my house is registered

494
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
Husband

495
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
So after

496
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,720
Some Googling and some sad noises on Twitter cuz I have my Google searches word

497
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Coming up

498
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
I realized I had to

499
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,072
Prove

500
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,608
ICloud access

501
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,424
On my devices which is something I never wanted to do

502
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
Hate iTunes

503
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Hate this

504
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,104
And then I needed to

505
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
Fight

506
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
My

507
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,664
IPad basic

508
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
To The Honky party

509
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,320
And I did that and then my husband had to approve an email saying yes I do want

510
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
Then

511
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
Ocean Center

512
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
For some reason I can't

513
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
Included as part of

514
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,768
My automation here

515
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
So I'm just I'm flummoxed

516
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,120
I don't I don't know why

517
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,936
Yeah this is a nice

518
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,264
CNET Smart Home

519
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,200
We have a

520
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
Product line

521
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
On an Android phone that we

522
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,064
Android apps

523
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,904
Access between each other we need to sort of

524
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,464
Step on each others toes a little bit it just

525
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Almost

526
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,560
We had weird ones were notable instance where

527
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
The office

528
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,984
That's her at the home

529
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
And we were trying to get this to work

530
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,824
Describe your husband

531
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,992
Would not work at a drive out there and then figured out in person

532
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:49,856
But when she gets home from work that night all of the requests that we have been sending

533
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,904
Your iPad and not her iPhone

534
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,720
And so did so many little hiccups

535
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:59,584
Especially when you have multiple users to share control

536
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,144
It's still a big sticking point to the smart element

537
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,496
So my request is

538
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,032
Now that Apple has made

539
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,336
Onboarding devices super easy

540
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,664
If you live alone and you are going to be Soul commander of

541
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
Tennis is probably

542
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
For now with

543
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
Trying to share access

544
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,344
It did not I still things are still not working

545
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
Offer that to you guys

546
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,208
If you have suggestions about the

547
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,584
Elgato motion sensor and why it's not showing up on some of my stuff feel free to email me because

548
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
I don't understand

549
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424
And here's a little update for you

550
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,728
So I promise you because this week

551
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Last week

552
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,176
SmartThings and loutribe you talked about this partnership but now you can control your Lutron devices

553
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:50,528
From your SmartThings Hub and this is done is a cloud-to-cloud integration

554
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
And

555
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,856
I was super excited about it because

556
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
The wink

557
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,160
In my house

558
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,440
Does all of my Lutron

559
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,000
Actually pal my Lutron Bridge does all of my

560
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
Stop

561
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
It was on the way

562
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
And

563
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,168
I was super excited because then I could

564
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
My baby consolidate

565
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Onhub 4p

566
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,032
I will never actually consolidate but

567
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
Tell other people bacon

568
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Consolidate

569
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
How nice for them

570
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,896
So

571
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
I set this up

572
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:23,296
With the intention of trying it directly through SmartThings and then trying it through both Google home and

573
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,624
Amazon Echo because both of those devices

574
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
Scientist

575
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,696
The sad news is

576
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
When I

577
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
Hooked it up

578
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,840
I was able to authorize Lutron on my SmartThings account

579
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,888
But when it started searching

580
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,912
For devices

581
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
It gave me a glitch

582
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,032
And I uninstall things I reinstalled things

583
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,336
Felt like I tried everything to get this work

584
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,640
And after about an hour I have

585
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,248
So I said I sent a note into smart

586
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
Sporocyst

587
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,112
And I'm still I've heard back from them but

588
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,416
There's this lengthy process of like

589
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
Can I look at ROBLOX

590
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,256
What's the username on the account so I feel like

591
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,816
I've had every 24 hours I get a request for

592
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,608
Can I look at your information

593
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
So I don't actually

594
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
Resolution yet

595
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:16,032
We have a ton of stuff in the smart home that we

596
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:22,176
We test out of anything

597
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
I will tell everybody

598
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,760
Please send me your it works fine for me

599
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
Funny stories because

600
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,576
I feel like my house is such a

601
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,112
Cluster of devices

602
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,160
Integrations that a lot of things breaks

603
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
It would not break free

604
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
That is worth noting

605
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
Absolutely

606
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Alright well

607
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,376
Write thank you so much for

608
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
Taking the place of Kevin

609
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
You did an awesome job

610
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,960
Kevin will be back neck

611
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
Courage ride please

612
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,824
Next time we need a guest host

613
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
We're going to bring you back on

614
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
Hey thanks a lot is great to be on

615
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,760
Alright guy stay tuned for our guest this week

616
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
Which is Ross

617
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
RV of the year

618
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
Which is an

619
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,624
Agricultural

620
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,720
Issues

621
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
With this in

622
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
Fabulous Australia

623
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:16,448
Sexy should totally stick around to hear that but first let's do a message from our sponsor

624
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:22,848
We are taking a break from this week's podcast for a message from our sponsor this week

625
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,664
And I have Brian tollefson

626
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
About

627
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
Hey Brian

628
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
Hey Stacy

629
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
Alright so remind us

630
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,696
Finans designs builds and manages iot software

631
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,232
Fortune 500 firms

632
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,536
Smaller manufacturers and even startups

633
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
And over the last year

634
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,888
We've been developing and delivering iot training is well

635
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,936
That's really you need for a software developer

636
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
How did that come about

637
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
It is unique

638
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,520
But it's been a great

639
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,312
Set for Engineering Services

640
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
It came about

641
00:26:55,104 --> 00:27:00,992
We kept hearing the same technical questions over and over and wanted a systematic way to answer them

642
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,808
We kept getting the same questions about how to add wireless connection

643
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
Your product

644
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,648
Or what features were important when picking an IT platform

645
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,464
That's interesting so how is the training struck

646
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,768
It's a modular setup presentation

647
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,072
Class of 2015 in 45 minutes

648
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888
And we can combine them in a variety of ways

649
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,448
Sometimes it's just an hour

650
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,776
On the phone with somebody but often it's a half day workshop

651
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,568
Where we cover a variety of top

652
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,384
We always start with a session that introduces

653
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
And defines iot

654
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
I can go in a lot of different

655
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,016
Directions we have a number of technical presentation

656
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:38,880
Including iot topologies embedded Technologies Wireless protocols cloud

657
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
Computing in war

658
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,840
It's definitely design for engineers but we work really hard to make it

659
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
Accessible to business

660
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
Does people designers marketers

661
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,936
Really anyone

662
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
Involved with develop

663
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,056
It strategy

664
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
Tackling coyote

665
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,872
The first of firms that have

666
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,920
Some sort of traditional software back

667
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,248
Maybe they've done firmware before but they've never

668
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,552
Developed a wireless protocol

669
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
Or an over-the-air update

670
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
Are training addresses the

671
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,648
The needs for that group

672
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:16,000
The second group that we see increasingly is his group I like to call corporate makers

673
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:21,120
These are electrical engineers or mechanical engineers tasked with creating

674
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
An initial iot

675
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
Prototype

676
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,776
They frequently are using maker grade Hardware like Arduino or Raspberry Pi

677
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,592
These are awesome platforms we love our arrest

678
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,384
Replies but they're really not the type

679
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
Used to go to market

680
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,784
So we've designer training to help penicillin the knowledge gaps for that group

681
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,832
And help them figure out how to go to market

682
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,624
Do you need to be on site.

683
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,440
We can do it either way

684
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
A lot of organization

685
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:52,096
Have remote employees so we made sure that our training works well over Google hangouts or go to meetings

686
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
But it's a lot of fun in that

687
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
It works really well on

688
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
On-site as well

689
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,496
So where can people learn more about 7 dance in your iot

690
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:03,616
They can visit our website it's been debts. Com or send us an email at hello it's been

691
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,920
We'd be happy to preview

692
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,456
Training with anyone who's in

693
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,992
Any more. Iot

694
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,528
Awesome thanks Brian

695
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,536
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

696
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,584
And today's guest is Ross

697
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,400
Harvey who is founder and managing director at

698
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,424
A company called

699
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
The yield

700
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728
Hello rise

701
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,056
Morning Sky see this morning in Australia or anyway

702
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:38,432
I was going to say it is afternoon where I am but definitely morning where you are so today's podcast

703
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,456
As I said about

704
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,480
Agriculture

705
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,784
But more about the business side so bras

706
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
Why don't you tell me what you're doing

707
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:50,464
What we do is take the guesswork out of growing and Simon Jacques

708
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
Christmas Day

709
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,536
Tympole and knowledge hungry

710
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,352
And using Internet of Things technology

711
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,424
We can help Growers make better and faster decisions

712
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,264
This feels almost kind of akin to something like climate Corps

713
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,336
Which measured weather now that was for insurance purposes

714
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,920
Is it correct

715
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,480
Actually not

716
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:18,880
Went really genuinely and I are teepees nuts and we coming at it from completely with different front end of

717
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,720
So we focus on intensive irrigated

718
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:28,608
Where are the difference between microclimates not even down to a plant with

719
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,376
Can they

720
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
Absolutely critical

721
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,008
At margin per hectare of an irrigated praying

722
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
What fruits and trees and plants

723
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,592
40 times what it is in Russia

724
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,504
And really that's where a lot of the American egg parties which they are very inspiring

725
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,880
Every light, cut their teeth in that mold broadyke are dropping in the five young cool cross

726
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,160
Which starts at very different

727
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,256
Technology because it's not your guy that it's huge guy out

728
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:02,144
Looking at remote sensing and long-term public Doctrine and leveraging that wears wig

729
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
Actually

730
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,960
Putting Harbor on the ground so we do enjoy

731
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:11,360
Hardware platform analytics user interface and really focus on the more common with us

732
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:19,040
Okay so Rose can you give me a use case or an example of this

733
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,368
Really real one of that

734
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:26,208
I know the customers that we work with it produces bagged lettuce

735
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,256
And they wanted to strides because it produces

736
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:34,656
And so what we do is using our technology when measuring 9 environmental parameters at

737
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,216
Agriculture things from

738
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:41,568
Temperature humidity life witness fools of blight soil moisture temperature

739
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,848
Ranger Prime

740
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:49,760
And then what we do is we use these to help Growers make decisions on found decisions about when to plant when to irrigate

741
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
Play Swing to protect

742
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,088
Went to feed and when to harvest

743
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,392
So we can together with Houston

744
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,184
She's one of my customers

745
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,512
It can take 4 weeks to grow lettuce

746
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,536
In summer

747
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,072
From plant to harvest

748
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
Butthole bleaching winter

749
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:10,496
And effectively they know that there's a difference United from Farm to Farm Road Road

750
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:15,104
In terms of the time and distance that it takes from in terms of planting and harvesting

751
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
But they don't have to

752
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,688
So what I do is just have one Girls quiz

753
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,504
And so what this company does he suggest

754
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,296
Overproduce to make sure

755
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
That it can make it

756
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:31,488
Enter if we can just reduce their production by just one percentage point it's literally with

757
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
With hundreds of thousands

758
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:39,168
Is business

759
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,496
But more interesting as well is

760
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,080
We also use that same Dark Side to deal with things like she'll fly

761
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:51,200
So when you cut lettuce and put in a baguette stops decomposing for the minute.

762
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,040
And the thing that drives it is actually or continent

763
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
The plant

764
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,368
And so we make sure that as a by-product

765
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,928
The work we're doing reindeer guiding and spring

766
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,768
And then we can find that two got data together with processing data and

767
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,072
Retail data and we can actually work at the

768
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
Perfect time

769
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,376
To have a sex

770
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:13,472
And again we just take one day extension for that one day

771
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,288
Then it's really really worth millions to the business

772
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
So I think

773
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:22,176
So maybe that's a really important thing about what the hughleys doing differently we think about the business problem

774
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,200
And we think about the

775
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,504
50 Cent problem through the value chain

776
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,832
Then we design platform technology

777
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,880
That allows us to

778
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,160
Basically impact that

779
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,720
Across the value chain and I think this is

780
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
Really important

781
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:40,352
In terms of Sam getting uptight goodbye to you see it's very difficult I think to get

782
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:46,752
8 return on investment I'm just a single-use Kiest and I think that the value in artery is actually

783
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,848
In half. Circulates in how you analyze it and how you can Bond it

784
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,944
That's perfect because it's listening to what you just said

785
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,992
You hit on a bunch of issues

786
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,016
We talked about a lot

787
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
Twitches

788
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:03,648
You're dealing with different sources of data so not all of its your own some of it it sounds like

789
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,928
The retailers

790
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
Free public data sources

791
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,768
You're also trying to

792
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
Follow

793
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,584
Supply chain all the way down to the

794
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
Consumer even though

795
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,912
You're not necessarily the company that can

796
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,448
The consumer relationship

797
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,776
I'd love to break this down a bit and talk first about

798
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,312
How you guys

799
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
Jet

800
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,384
Your data and how that whole process of

801
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,688
The retailer

802
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,480
The suppliers data actually

803
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,808
Best thing to say and this is

804
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,368
Heights Taxi

805
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,648
Boosting

806
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Is you

807
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,440
To have

808
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,720
Reliable

809
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,744
Accurate

810
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
And

811
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
I think just like you want to know that

812
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,376
Covenant to be food in the quality of it

813
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,912
You need to know.

814
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,216
Providence in the quality of Hadassah

815
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,776
Because you can't do analytics without it

816
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
So

817
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:58,432
In our case we do hardware and we partnered together ird partner is boss

818
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,736
Global business

819
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,808
Potatoes in sensing technology

820
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,648
And internet of things so we partnered with them as well as partner with Microsoft

821
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,208
So what this gifts

822
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,512
Is reliability and accuracy

823
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,536
And

824
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,560
If you don't get this

825
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:19,936
It's really trying to the analytics art as I said you were using artificial intelligence to predict

826
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:24,544
And in the case of art what's the solution which is a different product we have in Market

827
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,080
We get 95%

828
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,360
Accuracy 3 days app

829
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,920
Hauntings like Slinky temperature in Deptford

830
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,200
Critical to growing in

831
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
Supply chain

832
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:33,760
Really

833
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:39,904
The important thing to understand is you must control calling the daughter this is why I get so frustrated

834
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
Because

835
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,560
You just do not platform fit right in. If I don't know to call you back.

836
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,864
You don't know where they've just go garbage in garbage out

837
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,400
I think that's a critical issue

838
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192
So then

839
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
Second thing is about

840
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
This is

841
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,776
That's so we do Hardware

842
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,408
Because we want to make sure that we have good reliable quality.

843
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
And then

844
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
Really the person

845
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:09,088
Understanding the business model and the problems along the supply chain is really important

846
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,136
Because what happens on Farm

847
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
Ricochet

848
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:16,000
Through the supply chain just like that example I gave of Life Witness

849
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,536
And she'll flirt

850
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:22,400
And so what main really matters is how you actually understand and stop

851
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:27,776
Pieces problem and the value chain and how you been collaborate with others

852
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:33,408
And I think that's really going to be incredibly important in an industry like Agriculture and food

853
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,272
No one company can boil the ocean no one company can solve every problem

854
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,320
What you really want to have to do is Glyburide

855
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,368
And that has a whole lot of

856
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,904
Passions about

857
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,696
Your architecture

858
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,720
The way you

859
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,768
Design technology

860
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,816
The white that you should upload

861
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
Business model

862
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,888
The white that you can recruit

863
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,936
And the sub skills that you looking for

864
00:36:56,192 --> 00:37:01,824
It really has a very significant introduction on how you actually approach this and that's been very big learning

865
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,152
So let's break that down even further

866
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,432
Let's

867
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,992
Because there was a

868
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
I I wish

869
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,808
I covet that roll

870
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
So

871
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,112
Actually what's my bow Target

872
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
Want to

873
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,976
How do you architect or how do you plan

874
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:22,560
You're assuming this is both things like data normalization and also things

875
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
Like apis and

876
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,608
Terms of sending out

877
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,400
So happy planner Arc

878
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,424
Architecture and then

879
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,192
Look at

880
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,008
How you can establish a business relationship with

881
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
Needs to share data

882
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
Animal finally talk about the skills

883
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,384
API Centric architecture

884
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,224
Pretty cool and you not based on Open Standards as much as you can

885
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,784
The other thing that we try to do is be agnostic

886
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,928
Different types of technology and I know you and your listeners and explored issues about things like anti-war and

887
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,232
Galaxy fox in NBA RT

888
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,072
Really what we do is from Taiwan design

889
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,352
Ethnocentric

890
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,144
Picture design

891
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,680
The God of destruction

892
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,984
Madonna rockitecture to facilitate

893
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
I'm sharing

894
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
But we really

895
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,872
Very very careful that how we do that and I'll come back to that

896
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,200
Because the final thing that you really go to do so stinky patties

897
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:15,808
Contract senior legal Arrangements

898
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
As a business

899
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:21,952
We are very focused on giving our customers

900
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
Transparency

901
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,048
Control and incentive to share

902
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,352
Because fundamentally

903
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,424
Really what you want is much more like that.

904
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Cooperative

905
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,240
The market rather than terminal

906
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,544
And the back to work

907
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
Reply to Shannon episode

908
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,104
But they also

909
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
S2

910
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,200
Be confident that their daughter is not going to be used against

911
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,504
And so it is much around

912
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,600
Cultural policy and privacy and security issues

913
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,136
Messages about the technology

914
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,000
Now let's talk about the skills that you look for then in the people you hire

915
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,024
The people that you were

916
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
What we do is

917
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:06,496
We are very strong value spice business and this is really important to us when we founded the

918
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
Company

919
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,080
We had a very very clear purpose and that was

920
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,128
How are we going to see the world without

921
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Wrecking the planet

922
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,688
Not a time where

923
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,736
You've got unprecedented

924
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,784
Constraints

925
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,808
Climate change

926
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,368
Loss of arable land at the same time we have

927
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:28,768
Have to purchase 70% more food by 2050 just to feed everyone and so having a very strong purpose and value

928
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:32,352
Attracts a certain sort of paperwork to the business which is Christ

929
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:39,008
Thai Spice and the other thing that we really really look for is collaborative skills

930
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,544
And not being

931
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,128
Fabulous technologist in doing really really cool things with.

932
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,176
That's a given we do that

933
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
Buckets

934
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:52,064
But we also need to have people who can actually work with each other and communicate because

935
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,624
And also the pieces matter what we're trying to do

936
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
It's just

937
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,952
Make it simple tightly complexity why

938
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,768
And that means we do everything

939
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,560
And and we

940
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,840
Deliver a product.

941
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,656
I know it's product as a subscription service

942
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
That means you've got to have

943
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,752
Making Janine's electrical engineering

944
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,080
Systems engineer software Alabama what's the main exports yuan

945
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
Design is

946
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,408
Oldest working together

947
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,712
To make the experience into a

948
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
Beautiful thing

949
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,016
Totally imagine

950
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:26,880
I'm trying to think about what it means to be a business that is actually

951
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,416
Delivering insights

952
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,208
As opposed to

953
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,768
Hardware solution or even software

954
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,072
End the ability to figure that out is

955
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,608
It's going to be what separates

956
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
Successful iot come

957
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,936
Companies that use iot

958
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
From

959
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,984
Unsuccessful

960
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,776
So what

961
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:52,480
I seriously can't get that he's really the issue he it because

962
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:57,088
Coyotes Dream by technologist anyhow I love technology

963
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,672
Because my thing I adore it's not really

964
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,440
United

965
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:05,536
Bro has a very round and round

966
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,584
And you know they running a

967
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,864
Complex system

968
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,168
Rimini things interesting all the time

969
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,728
And seriously

970
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,776
Target customers the knowledge hungry

971
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:21,664
I just wanted to check in to deliver kind of value proposition from Taiwan

972
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,968
And you just got to focus on this

973
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,760
And you know in some ways that

974
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
When we

975
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,112
We started the business we called the business the yield for racing

976
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:34,208
Become effective that in agriculture, so you don't have a business

977
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:40,608
I really thought long and hard that will how do we make so that's really embedded in our culture in the way that we go about so

978
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,376
Sleeping problems

979
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
Tonight

980
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
Good name

981
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
How do you think about

982
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
Charging

983
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,520
Fair

984
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,056
Insights because that's

985
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,080
There's a lot

986
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,919
As you said a complicated things going into it there's relationships with

987
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,943
With other companies

988
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
So

989
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,527
How do you break that down

990
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
And figure out

991
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,111
A price and one that's sustainable

992
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:02,879
For your business

993
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,583
Essentially what we do is we create

994
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,983
Different digital solutions from the same knowledge infrastructure and we monetizing different light so let me give you a really concrete exam

995
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
Optimus Prime

996
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,567
Was it annoys registry

997
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,591
So

998
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,151
When it rains going to get runoff from the soil

999
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:29,759
Because of oysters at filter animals like she may like contaminants that make it dangerous

1000
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,343
And so the food safety regulator says

1001
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,135
Shut down when we get

1002
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,159
With the risk of runoff

1003
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,207
The way that they were doing that in the

1004
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:42,047
Past what using rainfall which could be coming from

1005
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
Thomas White

1006
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:47,935
Is putting real-time sensing into the water that that way strengths

1007
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
And

1008
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,495
Been using

1009
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:57,919
Parental Guidance down we got 30% reduction in unnecessary closures just do that one

1010
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
Something

1011
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,735
And then using artificial intelligence

1012
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,015
Predicting it

1013
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,855
94% accuracy 3 days Upon A predictions of salinity

1014
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,927
Then what that means he's Growers can get product out of the water

1015
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
Felicia

1016
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,511
So effectively what we doing is giving them back

1017
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,815
20 days

1018
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,863
30 days a year harvesting

1019
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,887
Which is a big deal

1020
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:23,007
What's that noise infrastructure reduce in Enterprise

1021
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,567
Set of tools for Growers

1022
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,847
Ducks things like

1023
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,127
Fly fishing Chelan

1024
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:32,735
Actually Megan Harvest it does food safety and tracking end

1025
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,551
Consignment reports that happening

1026
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,343
The conditions of my necropolis

1027
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,159
Harveston to orders and purposes only certain things

1028
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:44,767
Entirely different digital product

1029
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,047
The regulator

1030
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,143
And we have two different safety Regulators using the product in Australia

1031
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,471
And so we take that same data but now what we've done is doing

1032
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
A view that allows

1033
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,031
Opposite the rules

1034
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,103
Malachi Croatia differently series 2

1035
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,175
Mama said conditions to use

1036
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,991
And then

1037
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,295
It is too bad I don't give it to researches

1038
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,343
Different nice guy so together they want

1039
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,415
Exit out of the cracked egg right through that

1040
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,463
Will give it to you free of charge

1041
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,535
But we really loud music

1042
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,815
Tripping into a product

1043
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:23,935
Imma things like disease management and animal husbandry so you can have better impact and we can get

1044
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,471
Something's out of the labyrinth

1045
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
Antipasto

1046
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,567
So that's sort of the wire that we approached it

1047
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,103
And then you know I can

1048
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,711
We already having discussions look to pick Lock and Dam the value China vat have that.

1049
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:43,135
And I mean I ate to lose weight working it out as we go how we might as well so that the bottom line is if you can guess

1050
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,927
Enough of the Thai prepositions

1051
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,023
Not everything on top of that is obviously

1052
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,095
In the mix here is

1053
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,631
Your algorithms

1054
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
Your data

1055
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,447
Mixed with other people's data

1056
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,727
Other people's algorithm

1057
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,287
And it sounds like there's some

1058
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,335
Quid pro quo happening with some of the

1059
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,383
These maybe it's exchange and date

1060
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,711
Is there a monetary absolutely absolutely

1061
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:13,599
Absolutely looking at the bottom at the end of the day you've got to come up with a Y that everyone feels good about it

1062
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:19,999
And that's really unique businesses that that when you boil it down you go to delivering value to different people working together

1063
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:24,095
And so what that means he's pulling back insane what's your eject

1064
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,887
What's Market

1065
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:31,519
What are you good at where we go. And if we work together can we buy Queen and how do we share the risk and reward

1066
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,311
It's just a different way of thinking

1067
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:38,175
And so what's been really interesting for us as a small fast growing business is

1068
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
Wishing someone

1069
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,991
The world's Giants in

1070
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:44,575
Technology and food how you make that relationship work

1071
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
Text example

1072
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,647
Huge company

1073
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,231
Imagine it's kind of like two little

1074
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:56,607
Coldwell South Korea

1075
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,167
Living in a different spice how do you make that work

1076
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,447
How do you serve

1077
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,775
Mitchell is Italian prepositions a box and now there's a lot of

1078
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,359
That's my stupid wife thinking about how to approach the business model

1079
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,687
To make that work you don't have signal things with Microsoft

1080
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:17,343
Ibogaine understanding incentives and drivers of people with lopsided what brake light City KPMG

1081
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,879
I think that

1082
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,719
Example with

1083
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:26,047
Food safety regulations retailers it's really a bat

1084
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:26,815
How do you

1085
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,911
How you put together Arrangement that Sky we're going to pay the bill

1086
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,191
The Christ value

1087
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:37,311
And then I lied on that is always late than they Tonight Show that I customers

1088
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:42,175
Current control what happens if the data and it's not used against them and they shine outside

1089
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:46,015
So do you have any advice for a companies that are trying to

1090
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:46,783
To work with

1091
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,551
Bigger company

1092
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,087
Mediate

1093
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,623
The types of companies you should look

1094
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,647
Characteristics

1095
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,975
Cuz I think this is a really tough

1096
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,999
Sting for a small

1097
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,839
Yeah it is it's really hot

1098
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:03,167
And to get it right

1099
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
And

1100
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,703
I think

1101
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,751
My advice would be

1102
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,079
Obviously you want to look for strategic partners

1103
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,359
Partners that

1104
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:17,759
Provide something you don't have any no I think it's a very good agricultural sign that good fences make good neighbors

1105
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,831
Showing people who got complimentary soda

1106
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111
Technology in capability

1107
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,415
So that would be one the second is really

1108
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,951
Typed out you seriously

1109
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,767
