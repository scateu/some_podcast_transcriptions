Shopping for iot sensors you're going to want to hear this and

10
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,936
The things I learned at an event last week at Target

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:43,264
Discussing sustainable business models for The Internet of Things

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,152
Kevin has a quick review of a device that he installed in his home

13
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
This week

14
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,504
So all this and more await us sponsored by

We're going to also have as our guests who Paul Basu from NGP capital

18
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,000
And he has got

19
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,840
A really insightful view on what people need to consider

20
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,144
When investing in The Internet of Things

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,192
He thinks we've been spoiled by the cloud

22
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,728
So life is going to get

23
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,776
Pretty hard for IT department ever

3/9

33
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
Last week

34
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
I was in California

35
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
And watching

36
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
AWS

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,680
From my computer for part of the time in

38
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
Amazon

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
They did a great job

40
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
Watching a bunch

41
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,080
Of iot services

42
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,128
Rent out the list but we're going to focus on a cup

43
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
It wasn't actually a bunch

44
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,992
If you read their press release it was the slew

45
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
That is a fairy

46
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Cinnabon

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,232
Who is more than 3 and a slew

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
6

49
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Yeah

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Maybe we should ask madam

51
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
So what day do you want to list

52
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
Some of the things they now

53
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,288
I sure some of these are available in preview or coming soon so I'll know that right up front

54
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,128
Breath about bad AWS iot one click

55
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,920
Which is available in preview

56
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,784
That's to enable single button devices to print to do whatever you want

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
Dash theme shopping like this way it's more of maybe you want to call customer support

58
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,840
Jesus is a suite of three things I'll just list them out and talk about them

59
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,144
AWS iot device management

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,544
AWS iot device Defender which is coming in the first half of next year in AWS iot

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
Analytics

62
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
Alright.

63
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
The other two

64
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Two things

65
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
Go back and talk

66
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,064
Amazon free artist

67
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
So let's tackle

68
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,184
Device Defender device one click

69
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
And Analytics

70
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
These are basically

71
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,584
Some of these have actually been around like device management

72
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
Amazon has had for a while

73
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,704
Company a while back in added a lot of this so

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
They're just beating up some of their Chi

75
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
Capabilities

76
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,824
Device Defender is interesting

77
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
Because

78
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,944
It's going to allow you to apply to wristox2 any iot system

79
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
That you've got hosted in

80
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,528
Amazon's Cloud devices

81
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
Behaving oddly

82
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
CBS network

83
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
Say hey why is that

84
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
Or rather it will say

85
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,488
Yep and I didn't I did not see the event

86
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:20,095
Unfortunately my take on this was that you could apply security policies to devices

87
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:25,983
And this would be monitoring those policies of the compliance those policies at the device

88
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,031
Yes in actually this is hell

89
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
A lot of

90
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,127
Companies were doing

91
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
Managed air

92
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Devices out

93
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,735
Field today they just had to build it

94
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Custom

95
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,855
So if you think of companies like a large thermostat vendor that sells men

96
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
Any thermostats to consumer

97
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Xiamen other

98
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
They have this sort of thing

99
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,535
So this is actually a really

100
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
Useful product

101
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,655
And it makes total sense for Amazon to launch this for

102
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
Device management

103
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,567
He had a lot of this so they're just kind of packaging it up

104
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
Great Clips

105
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
I was intrigued by Adele

106
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
We've had this

107
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
Kind of with

108
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
The dash bus

109
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
It is something that

110
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,599
Prior to this you did have to program your dash button

111
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
So you had the iot

112
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
Amazon Islam

113
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Song Happy

114
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,791
I think they're just kind of making it a little easier and

115
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,887
Kind of getting rid of some of the obstacles so that developers are hackers tinkerers can

116
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:31,007
Get started with them I don't know if they already had the pre-configured Lambda instances

117
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:35,615
That work with 54 so that's that seems to be new to me

118
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,455
Again removing obstacle see if they can figure a Lambda instance

119
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,223
And so on

120
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,087
So yeah they had it but I guess you could say that beat it up or made it a little bit easier to use

121
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,487
Let's go to AWS Greengrass

122
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
This is something

123
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,327
Gosh so much earlier this year

124
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,935
This is an edge instance or Edge compute the time

125
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
Which is better functional programming

126
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
Switch

127
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
If we lost all of you

128
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
I totally get that

129
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,431
Lambda is Amazon server list

130
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Computing

131
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
Effort

132
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,783
I guess it's how to think of it I always think about it

133
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
In plain English terms as

134
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
You know

135
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
When you have

136
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,927
Compute instance with Amazon

137
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,999
You have to have a server that's ready to be spun up

138
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
It is there

139
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
And if you're doing whatever you ask it to do

140
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,679
You don't want to have a server just existing

141
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Throughout the house

142
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
Parody of time

143
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,055
Because it's costing you money and you have a device it's going to wake up

144
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
And it's going to say hey

145
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
I want to send some information

146
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,663
Innocence information

147
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
With Linda

148
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
And the circle is architecture

149
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,039
What you do is whenever you call it up

150
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
Amazon

151
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
I Spit It Up

152
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
And that cost less

153
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
Really brilliant for

154
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Coyote stuff

155
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,535
Yeah absolutely and the only thing I would add to that is

156
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:03,935
I believe that as a computer service you just said you know anytime you needed your call Lance there that's true but it can also be a

157
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,495
Event-driven so it's not like you have to do something

158
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,311
If your devices need the computer

159
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:14,175
They can reach out to AWS Lambda and get that compute

160
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
Yes

161
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,367
So green grass basically ties the functionality of Lambda back to

162
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
Pushed a lot into green grass

163
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
I'm just going to add a link

164
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:35,423
In the show notes that explains this little bit more because it's really complicated and most of you guys probably are never going to care

165
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
Macro perspective

166
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,287
One more news

167
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,847
The other piece of news is Amazon is done

168
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,151
What it called Amazon

169
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
And

170
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,223
Our house stands for real-time operating system

171
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
It's these

172
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,575
Tiny little os's that run on microcontrollers

173
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
So

174
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,159
You don't like you that the OS for your phone

175
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
A computer

176
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
Microcontroller are top of the world is free

177
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,351
Amazon

178
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
Amazon

179
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,471
If I could just go back one second and just

180
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,335
Only because again I did not see the event but going back to the green grass bit and the edge compute

181
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
Just this is jumped out at me and I don't know if they'd had this or discuss it at the event but out of the press release and said

182
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,855
Greengrass ml interface ml machine learning

183
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
Models

184
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:31,999
To perform inference locally get results in and make smart decisions quickly even when they're not connected

185
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
So this kind of goes back to that

186
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
Piece I wrote on the blog about

187
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,471
Making smart and smarter with machine learning and AI I have a feeling that's where this will come into play

188
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
Yes

189
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,311
Kevin will be happy

190
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,103
There's a reason you are on the show

191
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:55,039
Yes and back to free art is basically every connected device needs to run an art us

192
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,111
Or at least run some kind of operating system

193
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
If it said

194
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
Tiny dumb device

195
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,511
The Big Challenge here is if you are a developer

196
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:09,887
You're trying to build for so many of these right now cuz back in the day everybody who made a microcontroller

197
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
There are a lot of them

198
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
Call Heather

199
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
If you wanted to build something

200
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
Software for something

201
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,383
Then you actually have to start with a custom OS in that sucked

202
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,039
And developers to make a good flat

203
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
Developers you want to have as few

204
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,415
Operating systems is few platforms for them as possible

205
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,511
Arm launched one a while back there others like

206
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,351
This is actually free

207
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,399
An Amazon now having this

208
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
Means that I'm assuming

209
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,495
Don't make it so easy

210
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
If you're running this on your device

211
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,895
That you're going to be tied and almost automatically with one click service

212
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
AWS which is

213
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
Right now

214
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,783
A lot of the other Cloud vendor

215
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,319
Have deals

216
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
Mysterious like

217
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
Sudbury Centre,

218
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,951
Needs to link your stuff automatically into their cloud

219
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
So

220
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
By getting into the game

221
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
An artist

222
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,631
It was some kind of like sidestepped all of the individual board efforts that it be

223
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
The efforts to connect individual boards

224
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Specifically

225
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,335
And I have a question for you and because I don't know the answer and I

226
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:27,455
And if you don't that's fine too we can look into this would you say this is comprable to

227
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
Google's Android things

228
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
I don't know

229
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
If I could

230
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,879
Nail someone from Google down on Android things

231
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:40,255
I might it might be but I feel like everything's might be for

232
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
Requires maybe larger memory

233
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
Venda traditional artists

234
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
I would have to

235
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:53,055
You should look into that we should take some time to look into that because to me this is Amazon's big iot push and it made me question

236
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
What are the competitors doing

237
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,175
To the person that is like a big competitor so what are they doing

238
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
But maybe it's not the same

239
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,319
Comfortable exercise for bigger stuff

240
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
You need 500

241
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:12,255
512m

242
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
Jeffrey Artis

243
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Yeah

244
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
So yes that's the answer

245
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
Okay

246
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
But even though

247
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Which event happened last

248
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,871
Microsoft

249
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
They have iota

250
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
Cloud news

251
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
I do not know why this

252
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
It's fine

253
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,111
They actually Microsoft

254
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:44,767
Has had an iot presents for a while in a lot of companies

255
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
They use it

256
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
Because no it manager gets fired for buying

257
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
Actually I'm pretty sure that's not

258
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
They have iot Central

259
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,847
They've had an iot Hub platform

260
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
It was like platform-as-a-service

261
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:05,247
And now they have iot Central which is a software-as-a-service

262
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
So basically they've taken everything they've done

263
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,647
With all of their iot analytics device management

264
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:18,047
That you had to customize and they said you know what we're going to build a couple scenarios in Bryn off of that is a spur

265
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,119
I saw the demos there very compelling

266
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
If you

267
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
Want to start something

268
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
You can start there

269
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,031
There's going to be a lot more features coming over time

270
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,847
And I don't really know what else to say about that other than

271
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
Basically everybody and their mother is trying to

272
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,943
Make it easier to put your devices on

273
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Promise results

274
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:43,391
In fact along with that to make things easier they have made the Azure iot Hub device provisioning service

275
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Is generally available

276
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,231
Is pretty sure that was out in like a preview for quite a while now

277
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,071
Yes in you know between you and me I can never figure out what's app

278
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
What's today what's

279
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,703
Yeah what time is it

280
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,031
Well this is definitely

281
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
Yes as a

282
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,895
Okay so that's

283
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
That's not all

284
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
That is not all

285
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
Because a tree

286
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,295
Amazon also discussed

287
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
For business

288
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
Yes

289
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Big picture

290
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,767
Amazon wants to move into the office

291
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,839
Open talk about for quite some time so it makes sense

292
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
We have lots of questions

293
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Because

294
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,471
I'm just going to save as a madam

295
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
I'm trying to like

296
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,055
My biggest challenge so far in my life

297
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
With my smartphone

298
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
Has been

299
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,383
Making my Spotify app

300
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Accounts

301
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
Work on all night

302
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,575
So I signed up for multi-user

303
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
Spotify

304
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,183
Which is not based on devices based on people

305
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
And my daughter

306
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,767
Who is the most common Spotify listener

307
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,791
Cuz she's 11

308
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
That's all

309
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
She actually isn't legal

310
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
In the Amazon

311
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Amazon

312
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,471
Doesn't really recognize her email address

313
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
And she doesn't get

314
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
Mattamy functionality basically

315
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:09,151
So then I had to address for my home

316
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
Associate that with my

317
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
The point

318
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
Is

319
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
That's complicated in my family

320
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,879
When we bring this into

321
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
Office

322
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
It becomes wackadoo

323
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
So

324
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,815
Yeah it's going to be an IT logistical

325
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,631
I want to say nightmare about this a challenge for now

326
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:36,031
Because I don't know how this is going to be implemented and I can see why they want to do this and then there's some of the examples are saying

327
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,311
I'm sorry

328
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,383
Hey Madam a you know get me a conference room

329
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Or

330
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,711
Give me directions to the right room

331
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,295
Piece of broken equipment

332
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
I get all that

333
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
But the challenge that I see

334
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,159
It's the same one that Google actually faces

335
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
Because you

336
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:57,791
Typically can't use a Google Apps account for like Google Assistant Google home

337
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
And that's because of businesses

338
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
On their data

339
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
And the way these

340
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,447
Assistance work is they work with that data

341
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
So

342
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,519
How is Amazon going to manage that

343
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
Businesses

344
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:14,431
And misses are very eager I talked to lots of businesses who are very

345
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,479
Madame a into their offices

346
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,295
And there are certain companies that have built skills to do

347
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Things like

348
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Hainan

349
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
What were sales

350
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Q4

351
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
Facebook

352
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,047
The questions I still have I've read through

353
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
Amazon stock

354
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
There's no mention it like

355
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,959
Microsoft active directory

356
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
For example

357
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Which

358
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
I kind of like you can

359
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,175
Blanket to Office 365 Microsoft Exchange

360
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,575
It lets you made it so people come in with their personal Amazon account so this assumes that everyone's going to have their own personal

361
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Amazon account

362
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:59,231
It's probably not a crazy assumption for most people but there's going to be people who don't have this

363
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,559
I wonder if they will have

364
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,959
Atty the the work email addresses to Amazon business account so to speak for this

365
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
I don't know don't go personal

366
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
Reading through this book Kevin and I are a little confused because

367
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Rockets

368
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Divvied up

369
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,367
You can invite

370
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,439
And users it says to enroll their personal

371
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
Madame a account

372
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,279
With your mad at me for business account

373
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
So there is some

374
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,631
Teacher there to allow you to use a personal account but

375
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,703
I don't know if people going to want to do that with her employers number one

376
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,823
And secondly in one of the case studies that actually work they say they build a skill

377
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,919
And it called a private still see what they private skill that we've built

378
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:56,319
Matt American Reserve conference room style help tickets for Community management team and provide important

379
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,599
So

380
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,695
Maybe that's a way to get around the whole you know having access to the business data

381
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
You do it through

382
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,047
Enabling your own skills at your corporation

383
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,703
I don't know a lot of different ways this can go and I don't know if it's really clear yet to anyone

384
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
We will see

385
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:23,711
What challenges related

386
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,015
What was it called

387
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
That was a nightmare

388
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:41,631
This is bad times more so cuz it's more devices more skills

389
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:48,287
I'm in a household with people who do things I have no one in my house loves the fart ass but imagine you know your boss

390
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
Apps

391
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:56,223
And the other see there's a lot of lines crossing between personal and work there and additionally how

392
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
Amazon handle

393
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,855
Recognizing people through the voice Services here

394
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,695
Because it's struggle sometimes

395
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:12,095
Should someone who just happens to be in your conference room have access to all the data that's available on your Amazon Echo

396
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
Probably not

397
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:20,287
So those are the things were curious about

398
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,591
Pretty sure or if you're piloting

399
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
That's my Insite for that

400
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
Battles

401
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,271
Battlegrounds

402
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
With Amazon

403
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,623
And now Google YouTube

404
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Has been again

405
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,927
Code for the echo show after

406
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,255
Brief moment when I could watch the Corgi videos of breakfast also

407
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
They pulled it from the Fire TV

408
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
And Amazon is now

409
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
No longer selling

410
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,959
Products yeah I think the nest ceasing of selling nest

411
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,775
Product has been a couple weeks if not more

412
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:57,663
But this whole YouTube getting pulled from the show and surprising with a Fire TV

413
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:06,623
I hear you have a show you had then you lost it and then I seen you had to work around to use the web version

414
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
Can you can access

415
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
Reinstated it

416
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:20,703
This is a big battle right now it really affects Amazon's products the show I kind of get

417
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Because

418
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
I don't think

419
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:27,615
They worked out whatever deal they needed with Google in advance at the Fire TV I mean

420
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,431
It on there for a while I mean

421
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
And that's

422
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,271
Not an iot device theoretically it's

423
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
I'm surprised

424
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,647
I like guys get over it YouTube has the audience so you need to be on the television

425
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
Amazon

426
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,743
Retail stores so you got to sell your product

427
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Yeah

428
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
We can I mean

429
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Apple products

430
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
Amazon sale

431
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
I'm used to that but it's still really darned

432
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,055
As a normal consumer not like

433
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,359
Waiting up till 3 in the morning.

434
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
IPhones or what

435
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,687
So this is just a mess and it's

436
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
It's a mess

437
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
Consumers ultimate

438
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
The price for

439
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,087
It is extra frustrating because when you buy these things

440
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
You think they're going to work one way in

441
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,695
And now they're not because of the stupid Court

442
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Fights

443
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Remind me

444
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:25,215
Arguments for the last couple years when you're like

445
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:31,871
Yeah it's that same argument all over again just on different devices in a different content delivery mechanism if you do have a Fire TV

446
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,431
How big is start singing notification morning saying that

447
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:41,087
YouTube on no longer be available on the Fire TV as of January 1st 2018 so watch it

448
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,159
Nginx turn

449
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
Okay

450
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
I just hate everyone

451
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,095
That's frustrating

452
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,423
What is move to happier news

453
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
Corporate excitement

454
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
Walmart

455
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,519
Walmart AR

456
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
This is a great story

457
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,335
So Chris Ensley

458
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
Who is

459
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,663
Head of a team in

460
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,247
Walmart is 500%

461
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
Walmart so he seems like

462
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,855
He basically wants a

463
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,647
Sensor that cost less than a buck

464
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:20,256
So he can stick it on all of their products track of around the world Etc

465
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,816
She wants it to sense movement Keepin vibration

466
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,608
He would like it to be energy harvesting

467
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,632
And

468
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,424
He wants to get it really cheaply

469
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Vigilia

470
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
Yeah I mean

471
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,592
He said we have nearly 12000 stores

472
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:39,712
And they've kind of done at initial rollout of iot stuffing about 5000 stores

473
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
So

474
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,760
It's not like they're

475
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,296
Starting to play stuff

476
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,088
But it's obviously expensive

477
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,744
Actually made a really good point is I just changing our light bulbs is a huge undertaking in terms of cost and effort and songs

478
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,560
I get it

479
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:59,168
Talk about using LED bulbs Beacon somehow soda

480
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:04,032
That is something that people have talked about for a while so that makes a lot of sense cuz they're powered in

481
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,824
People that consumers can access them

482
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,408
Great article I will link to it

483
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,456
You can learn and you know if you have this

484
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,992
Apparently Walmart wants to talk to you

485
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
Coma

486
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,064
All right I was in

487
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,672
Another guy was at an event at the Target open house actually was

488
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,976
Last week and I had a panel

489
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
On

490
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,328
Building sustainable

491
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,632
And

492
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
Hives

493
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
Which is a subscription

494
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
Connected Products Company

495
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
British gas

496
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,592
Rob Martin's who is from Schlage

497
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
And Matt van

498
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Horn who is the CEO

499
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,456
And I learned many things

500
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,504
And I'm going to send them up really quickly

501
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
1

502
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,832
The June oven which cabinet I love

503
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,928
Stop for the holidays

504
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,768
Because they did is crazy pricing paint with Williams-Sonoma

505
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,632
They charged some $1,000 for this thing and it's Norm

506
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
$1,500 an hour

507
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704
They have no more to say

508
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,752
1500

509
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
Niedermeyer

510
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,664
Early adopters that's a tax I paid all my life

511
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
That's terrible

512
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
So

513
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,368
More related to the panel topic was this idea that we should be selling Hardware as a service in

514
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,208
A lot of these guys actually really resisted the idea

515
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
That

516
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
This is actually what they were selling

517
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:34,144
But the more I talk to people the more I'm aware of the fact that every connected device you buy

518
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,936
It's not a product that you buy

519
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
It is a service that you

520
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
You're going to buy

521
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
Now whether or not

522
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,360
You paid a monthly subscription

523
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,384
For the service

524
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
It's still a freaking service

525
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,736
And they have to

526
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
Manufacturers

527
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:57,952
Educate consumers as consumers we need to think about these things this way

528
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
Because right now

529
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,048
We're buying these things thinking they're going to last

530
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,096
The same amount of time an unkindness

531
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
Active device with

532
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,656
And that's fine if it's a

533
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,704
And it only last 3 years but

534
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,496
If it's a door lock

535
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,032
And you want that thing to last

536
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
30

537
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:20,736
Expectation seen numerous updates feature.

538
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,064
Missions like every couple weeks we get something

539
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,856
I got an email today

540
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:32,256
Yes thank you I love it so these things they have to build

541
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,560
R&D to figure out how to add these new features

542
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,352
Continue to support the old teachers

543
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:40,192
Hopefully into perpetuity quite honestly and then

544
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:46,592
You know you support them through questions

545
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,176
That's the second

546
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,248
And this is from Roy

547
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,040
Operations prayer hive

548
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
He was like

549
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,136
You really need to consider when you're building this product

550
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,928
The timeline you're willing to

551
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,488
Because that's going to affect

552
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,584
What you charge for it up front but also how you're going to monetize it over

553
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,680
Overtime you can't just stick a something out there and be like I will figure it out later

554
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,216
Which is exactly what happen

555
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:17,312
Because people 90 world in the computer world were used to

556
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,616
Things that may be last for 3

557
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,968
Well they tend to lease a lot of things

558
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,528
I thought that was really a good point

559
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,600
Because if you're designing something to last for 10 years

560
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,184
You're going to have a very different cost equation then something for 3 years or

561
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Our customer

562
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
Rather

563
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,792
Maybe we should lie siriano to devices

564
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,888
Something somebody should be looking into

565
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,472
There's a lot of questions I have about that like what it means to start

566
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,544
Paying for things monthly that used to own because

567
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
The form of wealth

568
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
Eurasian rights

569
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Can I get equity in my door lock

570
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,320
Yeah but once you start

571
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,160
Are you sore

572
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:10,816
And having things taken away that's why we shouldn't have to pay for anything at all

573
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,376
Not so fast.

574
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,520
That is not true that is not

575
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
We feel

576
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,080
Or that's how I feel

577
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Apparently

578
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,408
Okay so

579
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,944
Let's Talk About Kevin

580
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
Has he got a new Gadget

581
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,344
Yes we'll keep this kind of shorts cuz it's not super

582
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:39,744
Glitzy but I finally got around to installing the controls

583
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,096
For those who are interested it's model number G

584
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,960
I think you can find it online for 80 90 bucks actually bought a refurbished one for $61

585
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,776
So it's just a big Square module

586
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,592
That has a light

587
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,408
And you literally it to me tennis install this thing

588
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,736
You literally plug it in near your Z-Wave Hub witch

589
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:05,088
My case is a wink and tear it up using the Hub app

590
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,624
That way you can make your connection

591
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,904
Didn't unplug the device

592
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,512
Garage door garage door opener

593
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,072
Mine is an old Genie

594
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,144
It's probably came with this house which is Bill 18 years ago

595
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,544
And literally you connect two wires from the gocontrol Z-Wave controller to the garage door opener

596
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,640
If the same screws that your push button control for garage door

597
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,712
Is so easily stimulates a push of the button and then

598
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:39,392
Tilt sensor that you stick on your garage door and that will tell the

599
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
Controller if the door is

600
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:45,280
Copper down and that's pretty much it I mean I have it working with my wink perfectly

601
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,120
One thing I will note with this particular controller and this may be common

602
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:53,472
It will only accept one command every 30 seconds if you open the door

603
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,776
Remotely then you got to wait at least 30 seconds

604
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,824
How to close a tanning spray safety

605
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
Tradition which I can understand that but

606
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,944
Working really well I've created a robot 2

607
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
Shut the door for me if I

608
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:09,344
Leaving based on GPS Android

609
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,440
I'm not sure what you got

610
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:17,280
For my garage door is when the garage door opens after dark it turns on

611
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
My porch light

612
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,584
Very nice

613
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,376
Yes I like that

614
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
I like that

615
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,472
I will do that

616
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,752
Anyway

617
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
Very easy like I said

618
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,592
The 10 minutes to install anybody can do this quite honestly

619
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,408
Very inexpensive to I thought what it does

620
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
No that's awesome

621
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,624
Got it feels like decades and Internet of Things

622
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
Garage door

623
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:52,096
The challenge with all of these is for security reasons a lot of them don't let you do like voice control for the Amazon Echo

624
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
Google home

625
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
And some of them don't let you control asthma

626
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,704
Play things from Hobbs

627
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:57,984
Curse my thanks

628
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:04,640
Price Rite and I did check I cannot voice control this through either my echo devices or through my Google home it just isn't

629
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
Supported yet

630
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,432
I believe I can

631
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,760
Control the mic

632
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
Fee

633
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,832
South Jersey subscription

634
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
Hainan

635
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
There you go

636
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,648
All right

637
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,696
Let's go to this week's

638
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,720
Voicemail

639
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,536
Find The Internet of Things podcast listener hotline

640
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,936
Which is brought to you by Schlage electronic locks Schlage

641
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,776
Xbox

642
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,080
So you have to have a smart home system

643
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,408
See what's possible is it

644
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
Already

645
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
Let's play the voicemail

646
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:46,624
Hi this is Ray calling from Daytona I'm having a difficulty now that I've added Alexa to

647
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:52,256
They're getting confused with multiple living room notations for the

648
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,048
Various iot devices

649
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,096
WeMo switch home

650
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
Etcetera

651
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,168
Naming convention

652
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
All these devices

653
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
Shave

654
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
Fusion

655
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
Appreciate your help thank you

656
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,104
This is a

657
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
Great question

658
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
And there are so many ants

659
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,992
The basic

660
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Problem

661
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,344
Okay so there are many ways to tackle it but I'm going to give you a philosophy

662
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
Because that's what I think

663
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Is going to help them

664
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,952
I pick one thing

665
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
What I'm naming devices

666
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,792
I pick one thing tickets the name

667
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,864
Lake of the room that it's in and it's usually the

668
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
Dominant lighting Source in

669
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
So I have living room

670
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,520
And then the for ceiling can lights teacher living

671
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
So it's like

672
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
Left shelter

673
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
Easy chair

674
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,712
Or whatever and then they're all grouped together under that name

675
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,016
Everything else in that room

676
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,320
Get something that does not have the name

677
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
Living room

678
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,392
So there's a fan that's

679
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
Big fan

680
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
Is that a yes

681
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,792
It's named Afro Circus because my daughter named it after

682
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
Something

683
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,584
From Madagascar

684
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
When that was hot

685
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
Years ago

686
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,520
You can name it whatever you want I was suggesting that do not sound like others

687
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
Thanks

688
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,824
And I also have

689
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,152
Batman lose all of my downstairs downstairs

690
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
Which meant that

691
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
When I

692
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
Added my

693
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
And stuff

694
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,808
I used to call them downstairs blinds and upstairs blinds but

695
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
Diffusing so

696
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
Lower

697
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
So

698
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:33,120
Right and I'm shaking my head because this is a great question and it's a common Challenge and

699
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:39,520
I take a similar approach to pretty much everything that just obviously makes sense

700
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:45,920
Name some things by room office lights but I have

701
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,224
Office middle office bottom cuz they're on

702
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,600
Vertical lamp so yeah it's really tricky so I do it by placement and room

703
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
I try to be as descriptive

704
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,904
Possible

705
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,024
I think at the end of the day what we really need is what's taking place right now such as the

706
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,632
Grouping of things we don't even need the names so so you can just say it lights off

707
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,936
In the room that you're in free sample

708
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,824
No the challenge

709
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,128
My fans are on

710
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,456
Technically light switch so when I turn on my living room

711
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,296
So when I say

712
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,088
Everything is pink sza light

713
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,392
Even though some of those things are not lights

714
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
Stair fan

715
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,696
Or if you have a switch

716
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
Associate with

717
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
The fireplace

718
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,840
And that is because this is still very rudimentary

719
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,120
And we need

720
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:42,240
Had to go back to that article from last week we need some a i and some ml to say

721
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,592
You know these things are lights that's a fan even though it's on

722
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:52,992
Hydra light switch may be the assistant needs to say would you like the fan on as well we need to have that contact with

723
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
Don't have that yet

724
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,808
Actually

725
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,600
You know what it's pretty chilly in here

726
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,464
Yeah that's either either way that's fine too

727
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,816
I would say pick your dominant

728
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,120
Pick one thing and labeled

729
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
The most sewing

730
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,728
Many cases it's going to be

731
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,032
And then from there

732
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,824
Descriptive

733
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
Crazy however

734
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Children

735
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
In your life

736
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:24,480
There you go I actually find Afro Circus to be my most easy thing to

737
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,504
Remember because it is

738
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,528
So very different

739
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,368

Our sponsor

Hey everyone we are taking a break from this week's podcast for a message from our sponsor this

771
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:53,568
This week sponsor is Lux products and I have Rob unit here who's the CEO of Lux

772

The company and its position as a leader in Home Comfort and can

773
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
Trolls

774
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
So Rob

775
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,552
Can you start off by telling me a little bit about Lux products

776
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:09,696
I sure can so the folks at lox we are proud philadelphia-based innovators of HVAC

777
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,512
Control and we've been around for over a hundred years

778
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,840
You probably don't know this but in the middle of last century

779
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:20,448
We came up with what I jokingly call is the world's first home automation device

780
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,472
Which is the luck

781
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,520
Minute minder kitchen timer

782
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,312
I'll bet you have one in your Homer

783
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,848
Your grandmother told me your mother

784
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,432
Terrific well I'll jump ahead

785
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:35,552
2 about 30 years ago where we started focusing solely on HVAC controls

786
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:39,648
And I'll jump ahead even more to tell you that we've just launched our third

787
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,928
Wifi connect

788
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
Food product called Deluxe

789
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
Kono's

790
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
Smart thermostat

791
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,560
Ancona was a Hawaiian word that mean

792
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
Inviting

793
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,448
I think when people see the product they'll know why we need to Kono it is something you want to touch

794
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
And get to know

795
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,520
We focused on personalization

796
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,544
Design and comfort

797
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,848
Tell me a little bit more about

798
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,176
The kind of smart thermostats Wi-Fi so you can

799
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:08,064
Control it obviously from wherever in the world and it's equipped with all the smart features that one light

800
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,088
Expected has

801
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:12,672
The geofencing we call that home-and-away aware it has

802
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
Smart scheduling

803
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,744
Ford with utility cost us

804
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
Estimated

805
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:22,912
We have energy runtime and usage reporting on the app and it connects with all the three major

806
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:26,752
Voice assistance all at what we believe is a great affordable price

807
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
149 buck

808
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,360
Another thing I'd like to talk about fricano hazard warranty

809
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,432
We Stand by our products we've been at this for a very long time

810
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,968
For the DIY channel it's a

811
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,248
The 3-year warranty

812
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
If you have a pro install it

813
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,320
He got two more years that's a

814
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,600
5 year warranty

815
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,160
And we also have a service for HVAC Pros

816
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,184
If they become a lux

817
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,464
Sprouts bacon at

818
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,768
Another two years on top no one touches

819
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,048
Just that sort of Warrant

820
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:56,960
Okay now it sounds like you guys have really embraced the startup mentality since you've been around for so long

821
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,520
And you made such a wide variety of products

822
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,336
How is this influence how you develop

823
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
We have the drive and exciting

824
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,176
Man and the creativity of a

825
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:12,576
The startup but we have this established company mentality there are over 15 million Lux thermostats on the wall

826
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,624
Walls throughout the country already

827
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
Throughout the past

828
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,952
30 years and we build on that knowledge

829
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,488
And that experience

830
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,512
Of knowing

831
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:25,376
What the mainstream of America want so we design our products and develop everything

832
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
That will meet the needs of the mass Market

833
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,216
We're trying to get past that I owed

834
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,008
Key bump of early adopters

835
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,312
To get really through that and into the main part of

836
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,080
The marketplace

837
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
Rap sounds great

838
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,152
Where can I go to find out more

839
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:41,504

840
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,808

842
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,704
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is

843
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,800
Who is a partner at NGP capital

844
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,104
Adventure firm back by Nokia

845
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,152
So how are you doing

846
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
How you doing

847
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:17,856
Super well so we're here to talk about what it means to actually dig into the Enterprise I

848
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,184
Iot world and what you actually need to do is a business to make the

849
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
Successful

850
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,768
So let's get started

851
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,096
Quickly talking to me a little bit about why you think

852
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,888
We have maybe misled p

853
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,936
People about iot and its

854
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,704
Complexity

855
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,264
Secy CIT coyote like

856
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,544
Dashiki

857
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,104
Onset of high expectations

858
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,384
And sadly

859
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,432
Numbers astronomy

860
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,016
Jose Enterprises and consumers

861
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,576
Excited and we do believe that eventually

862
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
Come to fruition

863
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
But I think

864
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,928
Significant

865
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
It's amazing how you

866
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,720
You transfer me

867
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,024
The physical world to the digital world

868
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,584
And I think because of the

869
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,680
Technology has been moving in the last few years

870
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,496
Sometimes server to clouds to mobile

871
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,800
Expectation is that this is Magic

872
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
Call Alexis.

873
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
Looking for

874
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,896
Unfortunately that has not been the case

875
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,176
Coyote

876
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,736
And enter the number of factors agenda

877
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528

878
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
Why We Sing

879
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,320

881
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,136
We need to adjust

882
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:28,512
Okay well let's dig into that you took my Segway right away from me I love it so

883
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,048
Let's talk about why

884
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,608
Iot is different from it

885
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,888
So the first

886
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,936
Singing it recognizes via connecting

887
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984

And that is labor intensive

902
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,328

927
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
Caustic Bible

928
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,552
Look at these two

929
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
Taxes alone

930
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,856
Is an Roi

931
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,672
Which is going to be lower than traditional it

932
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,232
When you use the same Roi Benchmark I need

933
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
D-backs

934
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,792
Wednesday 12:15

935
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,584
Did those metrics 11

936
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,632
It Department

937
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,680
Disappointed

938
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
Who justify

939
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
Call Jack

940
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,288
Because the payback period Has to be longer because

941
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
Discontent

942
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,104
Labor and capital

943
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
Investments

944
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,456
Send it a couple more points I just wanted to admit

945
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,480
Enlightenment

946
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
Complex

947
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,296
ID technology Industries

948
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,624
Enemy sometimes we have too many standards

949
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
Netflix

950
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
Platforms

951
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,488
Which car introduced in the last few years

952
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,048
And what is that done is paralyzed

953
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,072
Organizations

954
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:42,144
Consumers can play with gadgets but Enterprises

955
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
They need

956
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:47,520
Predictability in standards and networks and protocols when they see this

957
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,800
Huge number of

958
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,824
Election choices

959
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,104
Daisy actually gets

960
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
Houston

961
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,967
Often do nothing and I think the last one is Archie's hyperloop

962
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,015
The benefits center

963
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,039
Weather

964
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,831
Defenses are being added and

965
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,623
Typically weather Valley Springs

966
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:07,999
It does not corporate headquarters what's happening at the branches at the retail stores at the factories

967
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:11,327
So git Department which is almost all decentralized

968
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,095
Does not

969
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,143
Vicky see the tangible benefits

970
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,935
In front of them so they often

971
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
Thai Taste project

972
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,519
Visible to them and their bosses

973
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:23,103
Okay and this reminds me of life back in

974
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,503
Kind of the late 90s maybe the early aughts when I T was very siloed

975
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,039
A lot of integration work

976
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,343
You know life was just a lot harder

977
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,463
And there was debate over should ITP centralized cost center all of these fun thing

978
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,279
And cloud computing came and changed

979
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,351
A lot of that as did like the SAS software model

980
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
So

981
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:51,519
Right now a lot of solutions are coming onto the market with the same as more modern biz

982
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,311
Business models attached in

983
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,359
The ROI that you're talking about

984
00:42:55,615 --> 00:43:01,247
Should we be going back in time or should we be trying to bring the standards and everything

985
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,271
Up to

986
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
Modern times

987
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,343
Interesting

988
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,623
Change which has happened in

989
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,415
Assassin bug

990
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
Chicago fasciitis

991
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,719
Inception

992
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,023
Because you started making a lot of

993
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,815
Purchasing decisions without doing

994
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,887
So what we are seeing is

995
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,727
Is it Department actually have been outsourced to shrink in size

996
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,287
Because bedroll is much more Gemini's for likes

997
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,591
Boston Market

998
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,639
The weather in managed by

999
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,431
Call Fidelity

1000
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:33,247
The organization that she much smaller than the 90

1001
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,271
And then on top of

1002
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,295
Dad security

1003
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,367
Beaches in opposite of existential dread

1004
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
Have kept them so busy.

1005
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,719
This new project quality.

1006
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,743
Doesn't get

1007
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,023
Supported deserves

1008
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
And then

1009
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
Some organization

1010
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
Utica College

1011
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,679
When we actually interview simatai

1012
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
Videos

1013
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,239
We find it actually busy

1014
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
Strategist

1015
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
Did you have this

1016
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,311
You have this you understand

1017
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,847
How to connect Asus

1018
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,407
Dakota Digital but they have no resources

1019
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,735
Are people and projects really under them of any

1020
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,015
Size 2 actually

1021
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,599
Execute project early strategies for trying to advise

1022
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:15,999
Golden seals on how they should think about the future a future of digital start writing what we find is this

1023
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,791
Iot

1024
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:18,815
Challenge

1025
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:20,863
Really

1026
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
Global mindset

1027
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,935
A longer-term Roi

1028
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
He's not getting

1029
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,751
The attention it deserves

1030
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,031
And hence

1031
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,567
Concepts WeChat

1032
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,103
Tom Dooley by champions

1033
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
Local champion

1034
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,663
An oil and gas

1035
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,223
Decides to

1036
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
Digitize their leg

1037
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,575
OSIM retail store in California decides to

1038
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,647
Interesting things into the cameras

1039
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,439
Prediction tracker

1040
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,487
Tends to be

1041
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,023
Gravidez

1042
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,815
Reasons for doing this

1043
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,351
Corporate headquarters

1044
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,679
Not as engaged let's do it

1045
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
Blank slate

1046
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,287
I am a company that wants to get this right or maybe

1047
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,871
Uno's Viera

1048
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,967
Or a big company for the description look like

1049
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,783
What was the organization who handles iot

1050
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,111
I don't know what the title should be but

1051
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,159
Should be an individual who

1052
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,439
Is butter

1053
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
Senseless

1054
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
Carpet function notable

1055
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:24,863
And this person needs to have an organization p&l which allows them to

1056
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,399
Deploy

1057
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:29,727
This obviously this individual event have to be Matrix

1058
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,287
To the be used because the Auto I

1059
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,335
From iot benefits

1060
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,103
Business units

1061
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,199
So they need to work closely with beans they need to work with it Department because

1062
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,759
The date of each comes out of iot have students

1063
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,623
So this individual does have the challenge of having

1064
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,159
Organizational

1065
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,951
Liters to make this happen

1066
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,999
But this individual needs to be a stand

1067
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,559
Leader who reports into

1068
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,607
Levels of organization

1069
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,679
The second point is they need to have the

1070
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:02,751
Flexibility of longer-term Roi

1071
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,311
Given the mandate to

1072
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,103
Sun experiments which have

1073
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,383
Five-year-old device

1074
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,479
So that they can actually deploy these yet

1075
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,039
Because the labor and the Catholics required

1076
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
To make this book

1077
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,183
Is that because everyone no one else is going to do it because they

1078
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,487
Demon Cycles

1079
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,279
It companies which actually exist

1080
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,815
Because this I going to benefit

1081
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,863
It's a bit like her Amazon

1082
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
Building Warehouse

1083
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,935
It's a little bit more like that

1084
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,751
Think about how did the world look in 2025 in water

1085
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,775
Investments

1086
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:39,871
It's competitive advantage and I think that's the mindset of an iot

1087
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
Key project

1088
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,431
What's the ROI in the next 18

1089
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
The last point I think

1090
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,271
To put some of this problem back to the

1091
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,551
This applies to vendors

1092
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,623
I think to get send you can find supplies for wedding

1093
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,671
To the deployment

1094
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,695
Education and

1095
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,975
Mention the software

1096
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,839
Subscription monthly basis I think that's a better relationship than trying

1097
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,887
Shifted out the deployment

1098
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,679
Bead installation

1099
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,335
A more complex deployment environment

1100
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,407
And how do you think they should handle the local asp

1101
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,199
If I'm at the edge

1102
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,759
I have a business how do I

1103
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:24,159
Report back to this digital officer

1104
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:24,927
Push project

1105
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,487
Yes I'll give you a real example of

1106
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,303
Just to make this year Leslie back to come

1107
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,887
LED control Solutions and direct selling

1108
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,167
Beihai quality

1109
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
Solutions to

1110
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:38,495
Taxis in New Hampshire

1111
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,031
North Carolina's and

1112
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
What they found was

1113
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
Stanton local

1114
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,383
Facilities manager

1115
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,175
Because their budgets were highly.

1116
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
Localized

1117
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,967
MP3

1118
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,247
Monitoring them against

1119
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,527
The cheapest solution

1120
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,087
Chinese supplier

1121
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,135
Width of a Sharpie back because the

1122
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,671
The building facilities

1123
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:03,839
Incentive was to just control an annual budget Evernote thinking about strategic benefits to the

1124
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,863
Headquarters

1125
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,679
Budget Inn

1126
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
Incentivization

1127
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,007
And so the way.

1128
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,031
Connect the edge

1129
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,591
Actually tell the building

1130
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,383
Facilities managers

1131
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,151
That's

1132
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,431
Ubud dog shelter

1133
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,711
Solutionreach

1134
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,503
Which is not just about the cheapest

1135
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,271
Dissolution

1136
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,087
Light up your buildings but which actually gets you act

1137
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
The data and then

1138
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
40

1139
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,695
Which can be used to run this

1140
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
Back to you

1141
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,767
Weather for the next 5 to 10 years

1142
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
Do that then

1143
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,351
Given the budget

1144
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,191
As I said in a 5-year fashion Nova

1145
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,263
So the local managers with it

1146
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,055
Retail store manager

1147
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,615
And at your local hardware store

1148
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,895
Local Target

1149
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,687
Needs to be

1150
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,711
Wendy

1151
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,479
Securing lights

1152
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,247
Example

1153
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,295
Cameras in their stores

1154
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,319
Dania

1155
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
HQ

1156
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,927
Did you sell right now.

1157
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,695
Is not the case

1158
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,999
Today incentives have to be aligned

1159
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,839
They have to be the largest for doing the right thing for the corporation not just for the

1160
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,983
Got it okay and all this sounds really complicated so what are the first steps

1161
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,567
A company that wants to benefit from a digital transformation

1162
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:22,687
Should I just like fire this CDO person should they what do you do if you want to get to the

1163
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,503
So I think the only time of year

1164
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
Scene Solutions

1165
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,063
Coyote sightings

1166
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,599
Ian has been where

1167
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,903
The CEOs organization has

1168
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,487
But we made the decision that they're going to transform the organization

1169
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,303
Digitized dog medication and twin

1170
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,839
And they going to

1171
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,119
Footaction

1172
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,935
Resources to go to the first step in my opinion

1173
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,215
It's not the title

1174
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,239
It's basically putting

1175
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,007
Somebody

1176
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,799
6 + 2

1177
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,591
The CEO and the CFO

1178
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,127
On this project

1179
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:52,895
And then

1180
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,919
Give them

1181
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
Elegance

1182
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
Environment

1183
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,039
Franchisee

1184
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
Like pasta

1185
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,879
Where is very hard for example

1186
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,183
4 corporate headquarters to tell franchises

1187
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:11,583
What to do in DC this in McDonald's and hotel chains where even though otherwise way clear franchises

1188
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,935
Which effectively on this hotels and restaurants have no incentive to spend money

1189
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:19,263
Different than where the

1190
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,543
Crunches actually

1191
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,359
Bullion by headquarters of the organisation structure

1192
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
The difference

1193
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,407
I think Sanchez

1194
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,503
Completely on the accident.

1195
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,527
The edge of your neck

1196
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,135
Like useful so that would be nice

1197
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
Genovesi

1198
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,743
The second thing you would do

1199
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,767
My technician

1200
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,095
By the ocean and tricycles everyday

1201
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,375
Addition problem

1202
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,167
Pick one use case with

1203
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,191
Chinese food

1204
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,727
Could be security could be

1205
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,007
Predictive maintenance

1206
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,031
Could be

1207
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,823
Customer satisfaction

1208
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:57,919
Just pick one and just run with it on a national level

1209
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:01,759
Opposed to trying to sell security maintenance customer happiness

1210
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,575
Everything in one massive project

1211
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,343
I would try to

1212
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,111
To just run

1213
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:09,183
One single use case with the base year value

1214
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,231
Across the country

1215
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,023
And then once

1216
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,047
Stats exceed

1217
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
Send

1218
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:16,863
One by one

1219
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,399
Alright Island

1220
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,447
If I am evaluating

1221
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:26,847
Project so let's say I put the infrastructure in place to actually do this

1222
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:30,175
What kind of projects tend to generate

1223
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,711
The most value

1224
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
I think

1225
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,599
The team switched into Jen has the most strikeouts at least tangible value tenths

1226
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,367
To be

1227
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,135
I would say

1228
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:41,439
Operational effectiveness and labor count

1229
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,487
Labor productivity basic

1230
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,535
Please show if you can get more work

1231
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,583
Square foot of space

1232
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,143
In a factory on the retail store

1233
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,679
You can sell mortgages

1234
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,727
Inside Fry's Electronics

1235
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,543
Private lesson number in Plaistow Central

1236
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,823
Get the quickest

1237
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
Feedback

1238
00:51:59,359 --> 00:51:59,871
Receptionist

1239
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,639
Feedback

1240
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,199
English basically makes

1241
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,991
What Cosmo Collective inside

1242
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
Building

1243
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,807
Car and get more work done

1244
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,879
I think those would be what I call low hanging fruit

1245
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,927
The next one I would say

1246
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,231
I would say predictive maintenance

1247
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
Trying to figure

1248
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,535
Phone sin

1249
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:21,375
Environments before they happen so that you don't have to spend enormous money

1250
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:23,423
1 sound system breaks down

1251
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,959
WWE

1252
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
Would be the second level

1253
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,311
Customer happiness and satisfaction tents

1254
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
To be

1255
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,871
More intangible and takes longer

1256
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,687
Trying to figure out

1257
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,479
Shareholder value

1258
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,527
I just lost project to standard

1259
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,319
This would not be my first phone

1260
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,391
Productivity

1261
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:47,743
Magnifica facility optimization as my first project

1262
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,071
This is in line with your long-term vision

1263
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,399
And where do you think things like sustainability

1264
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:59,519
Set in because I think iot has a lot of it offers a lot of benefits from

1265
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,335
Inefficiency standpoint and that goes all the way

1266
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,615
Through two things like

1267
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,151
Reducing energy

1268
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,455
Reducing materials and components

1269
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,759
Tracking them across their life cycle

1270
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,527
Baby making

1271
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,319
Things are recyclable etcetera

1272
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
Chill

1273
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,927
When were talking about the big picture and digital transfer

1274
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:21,279
Formations when do we go or should we go beyond Roi and talk about others

1275
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,095
I discussed this the Lord you know

1276
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,631
If I was building a brand new

1277
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,399
New house

1278
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,239
If I was buying a brand new car most likely

1279
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:34,591
Has all the features but if I have an old home or a legacy

1280
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,383
Sikar trying to connect everything

1281
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:39,711
Which is an expensive proposition so I actually make

1282
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,503
Brownfield sites

1283
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:44,319
Science groundskeeping Legacy environment

1284
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,111
I think there's a notch

1285
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,647
You cannot Transformer Lego

1286
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,463
Legacy environment where tens and thousands of years of

1287
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,023
Legacy Investments have gone in

1288
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,863
Facility training efficient environment

1289
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,143
What you trying to do is

1290
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,679
Make it more efficient

1291
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:05,311
ICD-10 sustainability value prop in an old facility is going to be tough

1292
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,871
On the other hand if I'm building a new fact

1293
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:08,895
Can you retest

1294
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,711
Anything's a new healthcare facility

1295
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,063
Look for Latina Platinum LED environment

1296
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:16,831
Idiot

1297
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,111
Try to make it out

1298
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,647
Sustainable as I could

1299
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,927
Because I have the ability

1300
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:24,255
Do that fresh and the interesting thing which I learned

1301
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,535
In my thoughts

1302
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,327
Construction engineer

1303
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,351
What I found was

1304
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,679
Six buildings against

1305
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,447
Earthquakes

1306
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,751
In the mid-nineties in California

1307
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,543
And what I found was

1308
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,311
Fixing a

1309
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,359
Building

1310
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:44,223
Making it earthquake compliant is far more expensive on a per square foot

1311
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,015
Good bases and to build a new

1312
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,319
Building from sky so I actually worked in

1313
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,855
Old Hospital building

1314
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,623
Does Kaiser

1315
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,415
Permanente

1316
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,695
Design new Kaiser

1317
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,511
And on the square foot

1318
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,559
Dimension index

1319
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,327
Environment

1320
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,887
Without dislocating the employees in the

1321
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,423
What is inside the building

1322
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,703
And thinking in

1323
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,727
That building up to

1324
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,775
Who was Far farmer

1325
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:08,799
Expensive

1326
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:14,431
On the first page footage faces and a new building

1327
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,199
UA test

1328
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,015
The cost of doing that is going to be much more expensive

1329
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,575
And that's what we say

1330
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,623
Nrt2

1331
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,415
Retrofit and exist

1332
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,439
Sing environment

1333
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
Space pen

1334
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,255
But you must sometimes do that

1335
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,583
To conceive

1336
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
A blank

1337
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,143
Looky looky

1338
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,423
All my new car

1339
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,959
Construction in online USA

1340
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,775
Kylie digitize Hialeah

1341
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,591
Invested 20 years bag

1342
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,919
I can only be selectively able to do that

1343
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
Okay

1344
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,015
Be the most optimistic note to end on

1345
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,807
But I think it's a good one

1346
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:56,671
And maybe you'll come back sometime and talk about how to change that how do we deal with Brownfield

1347
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:00,255
So much for coming on the show this week
