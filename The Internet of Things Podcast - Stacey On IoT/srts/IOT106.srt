21

R&D

28
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,848
Before that let me do a quick

29
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
Message from

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920

Hey this week sponsor is me

32
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm going to tell you that if you want to advertise on the Internet of Things podcast you should email Andrew at

35
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
After we talked about on the show

36
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
But there is a lot less Kevin

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,592
Okay Kevin

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
Let's get

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
Started

40
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
Let's talk about

41
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
Google home

42
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,224
But first off

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,904
I guess I am a contractor working a Google not on Google home or anything coyote related so funny opinions

44
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,000
Are my own and I'll even disclose I don't own a Google home

45
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
Doesn't yet meet my needs

46
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
I'm just flattered

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,424
Okay well last week's big news was like

48
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,960
That's very honest

49
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
Okay

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,544
So last week's big news was that Google added

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
11 partners

52
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
For its Smart Home

53
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,432
Integrations not all of them are live yet

54
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,504
But many of them are including Kevin's favorite hope which is be

55
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,112
And almost with that that integration almost got me to buy one

56
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
To be honest

57
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,720
See so I'm going to say that that integration

58
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
Plus

59
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,560
A new one that they announced a little later in the week but after

60
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
The podcast app

61
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
The Logitech

62
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
Harmony Hub

63
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Which is

64
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,496
Integrates basically your television

65
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
If you're not chromecasting

66
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
It's always hats

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
Comcast but it does have great

68
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
This adds

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
The Logitech Harmony Hub

70
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
To your Google home

71
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
That plus the wink

72
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,952
Means that this week I am putting it downstairs putting the Google home downstairs in the Amazon Echo that

73
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
House with downstairs

74
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
This is going up into my daughter's room

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,864
I will say Logitech for its Google home integration

76
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
Does something a little different

77
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,216
So you don't actually add it from the

78
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
Apps on the phone

79
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
The home app

80
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
The home app

81
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,872
Instead you say Okay g ask Harmony to

82
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
Connect

83
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
And then what's supposed to happen

84
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
When is the Google Assistant

85
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Will display a

86
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016
Hard in the Google home

87
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,320
You launch the app

88
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
You tap discover and then link

89
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
You're going to sign in using your Logitech

90
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Harmony account

91
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Information

92
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
And then you get the option

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
You'll see all your activities

94
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
Activities

95
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Watch Netflix

96
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
Turn on television

97
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
All of those and you actually get to name them

98
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:02,176
I was just going to say I was actually hang out with some people at Google the other day talking about Google home

99
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
And the common theme is

100
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
That when they

101
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
Use the hot word

102
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,648
Their phones also start listening and kind of hoses things up so does that

103
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
Still happen for you

104
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
Multiple tries

105
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,095
It does say specifically it says turn to your Google home

106
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
And say this

107
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
It maybe I wasn't

108
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
Like I did eventually get right up in his face and leave my phone away

109
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Run to the phone

110
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151
What happened was it kept opening

111
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
My phone and my phone is like

112
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
Because it has to be

113
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:43,135
It has to be done through the assistant or the unturned through Google home and sell the can be done through the phone

114
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Right

115
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
Because you need the phone

116
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,791
Your first instinct is going to be like I'll bring my phone with me

117
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
Because I'm going to

118
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,631
But you're better off putting your phone in another room

119
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
Standing with the Google home

120
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
Say What You Need to Say

121
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
This is my Pro tip for you

122
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,847
Start stringify is another app that does

123
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,431
The integration this way and I see Mrs indicatives

124
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
Kind of skills versus

125
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
Native support

126
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
I would kindergarten

127
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,023
Yeah because of that the Integrations the native Integrations all take place in the

128
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,071
Home app in the settings

129
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,399
Carrier getting off a Google Now card essentially so

130
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
There's some other

131
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,335
Mechanism or interface involved I tend to agree with you it's probably not a native thing is probably a skills types

132
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
Cards thing

133
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Yeah

134
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
Yeah

135
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
Once it's done

136
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
It's awesome

137
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,183
And because I feel that Google home is a better listener than the echo I'm actually really excited about tearing the

138
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
Google home has been in

139
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
My master bathroom

140
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,071
Which is actually worked out really well cuz what I'm showering I

141
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:02,239
You think then from a hardware perspective the microphone array

142
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,311
Works better for you with Google home in post for the echo

143
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Worlds

144
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
Google home is a better listener

145
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
And it's a

146
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,575
More accurate like gives you better results

147
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,671
Right right I think it passed into a much broader database of information

148
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,975
How much is one of the things I don't like about the echo

149
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
Having a lot of questions

150
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
I can ask my phone

151
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,583
I use Google assistant on

152
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
Similar to home

153
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
And I get better results

154
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:37,055
What with Google assistant so I can I get that and if it listens better maybe maybe your smile

155
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,359
It listens better and it's more flexible in its

156
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Command structure

157
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
From a natural language processing

158
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
Json

159
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
I don't know so

160
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
After this week will I'll come back with the

161
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
The definitive

162
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
And the Logitech Harmony

163
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231
Hub

164
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,535
I think it was $99 a month

165
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
99

166
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
99.

167
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:06,239
And that does not include any of the remotes your phone becomes your remote or in our case we use our same remote sandwich

168
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
We just use

169
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,567
So basically I spent $99

170
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
To have voice

171
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
Right

172
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:19,551
Obviously it works with Logitech remotes are they required or could one person just say I'm just going to add voice

173
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,367
Voice to my TV through Google home

174
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,183
So I only spent $90 on the Hub

175
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,487
How comes with a little IR Blaster so

176
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
And that has to be out

177
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,655
Right so basically if you want to change channels or not that you can do that all by voice

178
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,959
I can bring up the program

179
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
A channel that I

180
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
I want and I can say

181
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
Turn on Disney

182
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
But I can't

183
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,151
Volume up and volume down

184
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
For my system

185
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,503
Do not work some people systems it will work

186
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Gotcha

187
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,111
How to depend on your TV Hardware in Sun

188
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,159
So my activities that I use

189
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,463
Is our turn on Netflix

190
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Turn on television

191
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
Turn off entertainment center

192
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
The default settings so

193
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
Amazon Prime

194
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,567
And the reason I'm asking about this is because we get older TV through the internet

195
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:18,943
We don't use the smart TV apps built into our TV we use a Fire TV

196
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,783
And what are use a Nvidia Shield TV in my office

197
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
So it's all

198
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
App-based

199
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,927
TV and channels and I'm not curious how that would work maybe I have to

200
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
Create presets and such

201
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,535
Okay and the other is Kevin you pointed out to me

202
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
If the Google home sounds

203
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Interesting to

204
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
New smartphone

205
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,055
You can get both of those

206
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,615
Well without paying for the Google home and I don't

207
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,711
I don't know that we talked about this before we don't talk about smartphones

208
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
210e

209
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,039
Can you tell Whitney level detail here with

210
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:59,903
The LG G6 actually got my attention when it launched in February and it's still

211
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,535
I believe it's available for Verizon customers in the US now and everywhere else it's pre-order through the carriers

212
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,607
An LG will be selling a unlocked version

213
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
If you like in the future

214
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
This was

215
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:17,055
One of the first smartphones to be almost all display the top and bottom bezels are mostly on the Galaxy S8

216
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,615
Actually has even smaller bezels so whatever

217
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Depends on what you want

218
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
But the nice thing is LG not the carriers but LG is giving people a free Google home if you buy

219
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
Buy a G6 smartphone

220
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
And I

221
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:35,231
Look at this because it's a pretty nice phone and I can get a free Google home

222
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:40,095
The deal is when you purchase your phone you had to do so between March 17th

223
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:46,239
Which is already passed out asleep and Sunday April 30th service there are still plenty of time to pre-order in-store purchase

224
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,799
Ag6 and qualify for this promotion

225
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,151
I mean to submit through LG through May 15th or by May 15th

226
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,711
They will send you a free Google home

227
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,271
Which is $129 value so

228
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,367
I don't know $650 for that smartphone on my carrier

229
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
Free Google home

230
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,951
Some of the new Innovations Maybe

231
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
Maybe I don't want to put it but maybe

232
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
Will you have

233
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Foreca

234
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,935
Hi dive two dots are tap and an echo

235
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
Yeah I'm tapped out

236
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,055
I just don't know where

237
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,103
I would have to do what you're doing like swap it with

238
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
It's something I swap out in that go and put you know

239
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,711
There's no room right now that needs more listening

240
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
Do you have one in your bath

241
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,319
No I don't

242
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
I'm telling you it's going to be

243
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,463
The amount of time that I'm in the bathroom in a given day is literally

244
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
.1% of my day

245
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
Showering

246
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Doing

247
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
I guess you don't do

248
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Do your hair and makeup

249
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,191
Not so much I'm not on camera anymore

250
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
I work from home and I don't

251
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:58,943
Yeah I'm in sweatpants right now though I have not yet showered this morning so again

252
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
It might not be the best place

253
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,831
I'll tell you what I'll find a place I'll find a home for Google home

254
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
If

255
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:10,975
I do take advantage of this G6 free offer I'm on the fence I might do it

256
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,279
Am I heading wink really went a long way

257
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Yeah well

258
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,655
But but but we should say just before the show we realize this

259
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
We realize that

260
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,007
Even though the wink integration is there in Google home

261
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,847
It does not work with locks neither your lock nor my luck

262
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
Are showing up there

263
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Right

264
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
So both of us have our locks

265
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Cubs

266
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Right

267
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,063
They are not on there neither is the MyQ garage door

268
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,855
Which is something else I have in

269
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,231
Isn't surprising my guess is there's probably some security

270
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
Same security issues that

271
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
Echo had

272
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,143
But it's actually a little weird because

273
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
The echo right now I can ask that

274
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
Garage door unlocked

275
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
And it will say

276
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
Yes

277
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,639
It'll check the state of the locks absolutely and you can still lock lock

278
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
Walks through

279
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
The echo

280
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,503
And you can unlock

281
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Yet with the echo

282
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
You cannot unlock

283
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,135
Those locks you can unlock the

284
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
August

285
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,487
Right and that requires like a pin

286
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
To make sure it's you

287
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Yes

288
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,863
So that is the current status status

289
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Fancy we went

290
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,703
Let us move

291
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
Two more Industrial

292
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Specs

293
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
Welcome back

294
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
But I think this is actually

295
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
Pretty freaking cool

296
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Zebra

297
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Which is a

298
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,735
Gosh they are

299
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
What do they do

300
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,879
They were big in RFID and NFC

301
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Kind of

302
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Helping

303
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,767
Big companies handle Logistics and transport

304
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,559
Retail operation

305
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,863
National Sports business that

306
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Tracks

307
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
Football and soccer players

308
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
Yeah they have failed a lot

309
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
A really cool

310
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
Iot Staffing they've been doing it before

311
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,175
Since before i t i o t was

312
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
They have a new

313
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
King Anu

314
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:15,391
Product for the transportation Logistics business it's called the smart Pack trailer

315
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
And

316
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,511
It's basically a tiny little 3D sensor / camera that you

317
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
Pop in the top of a a trailer

318
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,351
Tractor trailer truck bed

319
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,191
Basically check the status of

320
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
Whatever is in that truck

321
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
Which is

322
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,543
Really cool and it

323
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,615
If they've also packaged analytics on top of this

324
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,663
So this camera

325
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,967
Obviously sees things but then it can also be like

326
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Hey

327
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,527
This is how fast is getting loaded

328
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
Fishing it is

329
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,135
Come up with your own metrics I believe

330
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
I work with them on that

331
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,975
I don't know I think this is like super cool

332
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:57,375
Oh it's it's a brilliant use of the technology I mean you know it's all about speed and efficiency when you're transporting matter

333
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Orioles and

334
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
They're talking about

335
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
The hardware This Afternoon lyrics

336
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
Can determine

337
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,615
Like things like volumetric efficiency load rate when a load is near completion

338
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,967
I want to load is about to be freed up so that the new load can begin I mean

339
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:16,575
Again it's all about as you said Logistics and I think it's a brilliant application

340
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,927
And it also works with other people's grpc

341
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,743
Enterprise resource planning systems so like your sap

342
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
Software

343
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
This is actually so

344
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,399
I remember watching a video about the port of Hamburg

345
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
In Germany

346
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,495
And it was really fascinated like a giant essay

347
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Case study

348
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
But

349
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
What it does is basically

350
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,895
Because it's so small

351
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
The

352
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,247
Companies that are the trucks that are taking the containers away

353
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
They have to

354
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,063
Like basically state park outside of the

355
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,647
And what happens is as below zar

356
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Getting

357
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
It's like as they're getting ready to

358
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,327
Finish a load basically they're like already notifying that trailer

359
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
There is

360
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Trailer guy

361
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
To be like all right

362
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
Start your engines

363
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Come on in and so it's like

364
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
Instant you know like

365
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
This guy drives away this guy pulls

366
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
It's all fancy

367
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,663
You know again this is a case study so I'm sure it

368
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
They should be only the perfect things

369
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:15,967
But

370
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,831
The stuff is actually really cool it reduces like idling time which has Allah

371
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Fishing

372
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,439
You're a small port with no

373
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,023
Please put things are if you got a small loading dock this is really cool

374
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
I would agree and just think

375
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
Taking it to the next level

376
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
There's a lot of work being done on

377
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
Autonomous tractor trailer driving

378
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,359
And when you start pairing these two things together you're going to have even more efficiency so it's really really interesting

379
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,711
Course that may get to like oh how long till people stop

380
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
I don't know

381
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,855
The robots are coming to take a stickler jobs

382
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,207
I can't take it podcast

383
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Bruker

384
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,327
Oh I don't know Kevin we probably could be easily replaced by robots

385
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,215
Somebody smarter than me yes I agree with that

386
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,591
Also on the industrial side and this is what the industrial and Enterprise

387
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
I don't know

388
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
We really want to get into

389
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,175
But this is

390
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:24,319
This is about beacons I was a Bluetooth World last week and they were little estimate beacons just everywhere

391
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
I was reminded

392
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
How inefficient

393
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
I think pékin

394
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,463
Because the battery powered

395
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,511
Stuck in gear places people

396
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Boobs

397
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
But

398
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,631
A company called missed that I have written about before

399
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
And I think we may have talked about

400
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
They have come up with

401
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
A

402
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
Technology that lets you do virtual bee

403
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
So what it is it software that you

404
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,615
Put on your Wi-Fi access Play

405
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
Points

406
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
I think you have to buy the

407
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
Hardware for them

408
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,551
You get this image overlay of your offices basic

409
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
And then you take it

410
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
And you can like

411
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:05,279
Establish virtual beacons silver virtual Bluetooth beacons basically using their technology

412
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
You're like oh I want one by the bathroom so I can see

413
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
How many people are using their phones on the toilet

414
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
You probably should not do

415
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
But

416
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
You can see how many people are in the bathroom

417
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,127
Could even tell you that you need more bathroom facilities

418
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
7 yes

419
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
This is

420
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
So but

421
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:31,135
Companies are actually using this for things like wayfinding so you can put these virtual beacons

422
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,671
Along the long hallway

423
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
Beard

424
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,255
University of Stanford University is actually using it

425
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
And

426
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,863
They're also using it in warehouses

427
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,935
4like Logistics efforts to like

428
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,007
Track where people are getting gummed up

429
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,871
You can even use it for asset tracking if you put sensors on like machinery

430
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:56,223
So if you put a Bluetooth sensor module on like a big robot that you love

431
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,783
You can always know where that robot is

432
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,135
By creating like this Forest a virtual begins around it as opposed to the physical begins

433
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
I've Loved missed four

434
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,023
Yeah I think cell most common sense

435
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
To actually move the

436
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,119
Beacon technology into existing

437
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,935
It Network infrastructure because

438
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,471
8 more flexible

439
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,823
Can use theoretically devices you already have

440
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,687
Bekins nothing is estimate and all the pain now the others can make the physical beacons

441
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
But just

442
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
Having

443
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,319
Piece of Hardware that's dedicated to just basically Bluetooth signals

444
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,111
I just doesn't make sense to me

445
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,951
You know what in terms of cost and efficiency and so on so I love this idea

446
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Mist

447
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
That's the company

448
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
It's pretty cool

449
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
All right

450
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
Smart home data

451
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
We in the last week or two

452
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,663
Both came out at the same time

453
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,455
Yes Euro put out

454
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,015
Report called a peek inside the connected home

455
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,111
Put out some data about devices

456
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
So let's start with

457
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Eero

458
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Because

459
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
What I felt like it was a little bit more

460
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,327
One thing it was only five pages versus 33

461
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,887
Thanks wink

462
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,495
It is device-specific so we're heroes are

463
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,055
Definitely

464
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,383
Few people who bought it for

465
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
Can I hear

466
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
A lot of that

467
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,271
And they're probably upper-upper income

468
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
So with that in mind though

469
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,879
The Eero guy said hey

470
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,463
There's an average of 10 device Types on Eero Network

471
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
Now that's not number of devices that's device types

472
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
The top one

473
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,655
Are iPhones than iPad Spotify Sonos

474
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
Then Android

475
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
Then Apple TV

476
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
The nest

477
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,311
MacBook Pros HP printers

478
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
Candles in Amazon echos

479
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,687
So that's actually surprised since

480
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
25 + 6 million

481
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
Sowell represent

482
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,063
Well yeah

483
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,159
I'm not surprised too but it's interesting that they're considering

484
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,719
Phones and tablets traditional Computing devices as

485
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
Separate device types

486
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Chris Wright

487
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,095
You know like an iPhone an Android device

488
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
Likely phones

489
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,215
Obviously iPhone isn't Android devices will likely at a phone

490
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
South butt

491
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,079
There is value in knowing

492
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
What type of

493
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Sonos

494
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
Stowe

495
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
Data about

496
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Sonos

497
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,367
Crazy 25% of all Eero Network

498
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,647
Have Sonos

499
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:48,767
That actually makes sense to me because I consider Sonos it's a great product

500
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,095
I considered a higher-end product in terms of pricing

501
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
In its category

502
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,447
And so is the year of a kind of just fits

503
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
It does

504
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
So maybe

505
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,543
Maybe Sonos and Eero should get together and

506
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,591
And do a little

507
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
Imesh WiFi

508
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
So

509
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
Was someone has

510
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
494

511
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
Connected devices

512
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
Sunny single net

513
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
I kind of think that's an awful

514
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,232
Either that or that's somebody

515
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,280
That does this for a living

516
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,584
Does IRT type stuff for a living

517
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
I don't know

518
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
Cuz

519
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,936
I will I will tell you that my Eero

520
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,960
My network

521
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,752
Which has a lot of crazy stuff

522
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:36,384
So I've got 32 online but many of my computers and phones are not running around

523
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
Right now

524
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
That's probably the most

525
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,784
Anything else jump out at you from the Eero stuff

526
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,112
So much for the Eero stuff I we talked about the wink

527
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Edits

528
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,232
Here Wego 2.3 million products are connected to the

529
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Link platform

530
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
Yeah that's a lot

531
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
Cuz I only have

532
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,984
Yeah I think I have about 2:12 or 12

533
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
What else

534
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,384
This is interesting and we're kind of

535
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:15,296
Scratching their heads over the definition of this but it says weeks has the 27% of Americans which is overseas

536
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,088
66 million Americans

537
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,904
I purchase a connected product for their home

538
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,464
Smith sounds like a high percentage

539
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:27,584
But there's a question of is it is it actual people or is it household and

540
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,632
What's a connected product

541
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
Kira was including

542
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
I don't know

543
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
Big number I just wish they would

544
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:42,432
Explain to have expunged little bit more yeah because Forrester put out data in 2016 saying that only 6%

545
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
At homes

546
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Bought

547
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Household salary house

548
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
And so

549
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
These numbers feel

550
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Wildly

551
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,696
But again

552
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,048
And they have 20% of households with

553
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,352
Household income under 50000

554
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,888
Purchased a connected product

555
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,216
This a few minutes but

556
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,008
I can't say it enough

557
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,824
Making your Home Smart does not need to cost that much money

558
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:14,688
That was the other big take

559
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Json

561
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,552
Let me let me scroll down the 33 page

562
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:27,232
Wink ask people how much they think it would cost to turn your home into a smart home and 34% of American and said

563
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,024
About $5,000 or more

564
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,840
Still seems kind of high but whatever

565
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,632
9% of Americans

566
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:37,472
$20,000 and I have to assume that either a

567
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
They're not really

568
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,800
Conscious of the

569
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,616
Inexpensive products are out there or be

570
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,712
They really want to go with a hardwired system which will certainly add cost

571
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,528
Yes maybe maybe they called it a Crestron

572
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
Chris Savant dealer was like

573
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Hey

574
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
I want Nathan myhrvold house

575
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
Interlinc

576
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
Here you go that's my thoughts

577
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,024
I will tell you guys though that I spent about $9,000 on

578
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
In my house

579
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,632
Granted I am an edge case really weird

580
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,472
Ahead of the curve trying lots of different things I'm not surprised at

581
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
I would think

582
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,824
I didn't add it up but I gotta believe I spent

583
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,360
Less than $1,000

584
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
Beasley

585
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,944
Yeah cuz most hubs cost about a hundred

586
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,064
Connect to thermostat you can L buy it

587
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
70

588
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
At 154 my lock

589
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:35,328
So we're closing in on a thousand but then you end but the rest of the products are all

590
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,376
$40 switches

591
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,680
$15 light bulbs

592
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,288
It's not like I'm a hundred light bulbs are connected in my house if I have 6 or 8 Maybe

593
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,824
I was like the light bulbs Canada

594
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
I've spent

595
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
Probably 300

596
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,712
My motion like

597
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,064
Motion sense putting motion sensing in my utility room in my closet

598
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,856
And my

599
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
Hold on

600
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
I'm counting light bulbs

601
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
$3,600

602
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
2

603
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
Automate 3

604
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
Sa36

605
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
That's better

606
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,776
That's better I'm not crazy

607
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
Did the nice thing is

608
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:24,736
With that there's there's a ranger product then it doesn't matter what platform product you choose you got to choose what's best for you

609
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,528
No matter what you choose

610
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,320
You know you can get started for

611
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
Like I said a hundred bucks

612
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,720
You can just add some switches are light bulbs for you know anywhere from 15 to $40

613
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
Apopka

614
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
Sapulpa

615
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,792
Switch whenever

616
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,096
You can get started and add-on

617
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,632
Very simple and very cheap

618
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,168
Oh hey by the way

619
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
I should tell you

620
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,240
That you can buy

621
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,520
All of April

622
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,056
499

623
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
That's what I have

624
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,920
Although

625
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
Since there is a

626
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,760
SEC privacy

627
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,880
Keep that in mind but if you like to ecobee3 with sensor you can buy it for $200

628
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
And it's homekit

629
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,488
That's a random little note there

630
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,536
Okay moving on

631
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,072
Little bits of news

632
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
Fun things

633
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
August has a

634
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
Pro

635
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
Lock

636
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,984
This is a Z-Wave based

637
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
August lock

638
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,824
This is for professional installers is called a Smart Lock

639
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Lock Pro

640
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:28,992
It is only available to August Pro members and those are people who sell the security dealers and integrators who do custom homes

641
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,088
Does anybody know why

642
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
It's

643
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
Kind of

644
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,720
It's not something you can't buy you have to get it through a security distributor

645
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,792
Probably because it's

646
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
I don't know maybe

647
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,400
I mean I have a Z-Wave lock

648
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
I do too

649
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,264
Installed it I bought it at Lowes

650
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,080
I'm guessing they want to push more people to

651
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,384
There are more money

652
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
Well I imagine

653
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
Oh I mean on the installation

654
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
Regardless of the product

655
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:08,416
The Mindy Project has a price yes but then you're going to pay for installer

656
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,232
Well so and I will say actually cuz this just happen

657
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
The news

658
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,072
Security protocol actually went live

659
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:19,168
And so now everything that is Z-Wave has to follow the Z-Wave

660
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,704
S2 security

661
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,544
And that happened as of this weekend

662
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,824
I think it's April 2nd

663
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
So

664
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,504
It's probably a security thing if I'm doing a custom install in a client wants an August lock and probably go to be like look I can't man

665
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
App for you

666
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,368
Because it's Wi-Fi and that's that's too far gone but

667
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,416
A lot of these they can manage

668
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
To Rahab

669
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,024
Does that mean that

670
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,584
As the weather gets more secure

671
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,680
We will have less products that you can purchase and install yourself

672
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,032
I hope not cuz that would be very bad thing for Z-Wave in my opinion

673
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,080
Yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't sweat

674
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,384
The security is more retroactive

675
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,688
Holy crap people are hacking everything

676
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
Yeah

677
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,832
Oh I should also say I've been saying August uses Wi-Fi

678
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,624
It doesn't it uses Bluetooth

679
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:15,232
It has Wi-Fi capabilities like if you wanted to talk to your Google home or the echo

680
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
You have to have

681
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,792
Abridge

682
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,840
Basically have an August connect

683
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
I know

684
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,728
I know I meant I'm inside Bridge

685
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
I know your aunt

686
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:27,776
Sorry

687
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
Tyson

688
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,360
Titans

689
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
Security holes

690
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,992
Will this is not good

691
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,064
Take on Samsung particular because every platform is

692
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,344
Constantly under

693
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
Threat of

694
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,904
Malware and other

695
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,184
Issues

696
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
Butts

697
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,512
This is not good so

698
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,424
Tyson is the iot platform that Samsung uses a platform that use variety I should say for the LG devices such as SmartThings

699
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,216
I believe so yes

700
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
That's the plan

701
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
That's the plan

702
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:05,920
I'll bet they're smart TVs for example of do their watches do

703
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,456
They're they're connected watches and such

704
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,736
In any case

705
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,040
So an article came out

706
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:17,184
That's a researcher in Israel discovered

707
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
Kaizen

708
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
That would

709
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,048
Yeah 40 that would allow hackers

710
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,608
Remote access to the millions of tizen device

711
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
Around the world

712
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
This is an actual quote

713
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,960
From the researcher

714
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
Talk about Tyson

715
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,568
It may be the worst code I've ever seen

716
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,384
Everything everything you can do wrong there they do it

717
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
Yikes

718
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
Yasso

719
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:45,088
Happily Samsung has reached out to the researcher and said we're going to work with you on your findings and close these holes and so on

720
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,416
Haven't heard anything more official from Samsung that is so

721
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:55,328
All I'm going to say is if you're using tizen at all just keep an eye on things because this information

722
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
Wildin

723
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,400
Doesn't mean you're being hacked or exploited

724
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,216
Opportunity certainly there

725
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:07,360
Yes and I should know that the vulnerabilities allow hackers to take control of a tizen device

726
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
Remotely

727
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,992
Superbad which is super bad cuz a lot of a lot of iot stuff is actually

728
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,808
You need physical access to hack it or you need to be within a few

729
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
Of the device

730
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
On the same network

731
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,768
That's not great news for tizen

732
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,328
But let's move on I have found

733
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,608
A fantastic

734
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,376
Be interesting

735
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,168
Product it's called Nora

736
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,240
And you can fight it at smartnora.com

737
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:40,128
What it does is it to text snoring and then it inflates your pillow

738
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,968
So your head position change

739
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,992
Presumably

740
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
Stop snore

741
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,088
I just going to come out to you guys I snore

742
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
My husband will

743
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:57,280
Always tell me about it he actually has earplugs and is a very sad man because I

744
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,864
I do snore so I'm looking at this it's $279

745
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,912
Which feels like a lot of money

746
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,472
But but it's a smart

747
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:09,312
Pillows with a sensor that you put on your nightstand and listens for snoring

748
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
Brook Soso

749
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,360
I like the prices too bad

750
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,408
Well yeah that actually stops

751
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,200
Snoring there is a pek

752
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:19,040
There is a pebble thing the pebble thing is what listens for

753
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,088
The snoring and there is a

754
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
Case

755
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,184
Apparently holds the other apparatus

756
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,976
People seem to like it

757
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,024
So I may just

758
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
See how this works

759
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:34,144
A little bit though on the website whenever someone purchases it

760
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,960
You see Rachel from Sugarland

761
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
Just purchased one of these

762
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,080
DC Stacy

763
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,616
From Austin just purchased

764
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,176
Yeah

765
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,224
Adding to that $9,000 bill

766
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:54,624
You can use this with any pillow I thought they ask at a specific pillow but now it's that you put the sum

767
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,184
Module underneath

768
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
The pillow that you use

769
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,488
Yeah it looks like

770
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
It kind of looks like my

771
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
Ice packs

772
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,840
Yeah yeah yeah

773
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,120
It's a little air pump AC

774
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,656
Interesting to me

775
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,960
I will not buy to talk and I'll tell you I ate I don't

776
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
Which is good

777
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,080
My wife and I we invested in the

778
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,152
Sleep Number beds a couple years back

779
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,176
And we got

780
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,968
The kind that you can actually

781
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,016
Raise or lower your head in your feet and such

782
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,808
And it uses air pump to inflate

783
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,880
The mattress to your suite number whatever

784
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:30,976
It's very similar technology this is just automatic on the pillow specifically

785
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,048
Yeah there's a 60-day satisfaction

786
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
Brad in Winston-Salem

787
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Chess purchase

788
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,400
Way to go grad

789
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,448
There's like a telephone

790
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,008
I might buy one.

791
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:48,128
The shout-out to Brad who will no longer snore thanks to Nora

792
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,176
This is what I'm going to

793
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,224
I will test this out

794
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,504
Spy Carly

795
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,552
It seems like it's a good

796
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,904
Lattice 60-day money-back guarantee I mean if it's if it's terrible

797
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:04,512
It's Jeremy in Tempe

798
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,072
Arizona desert

799
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
And one final bit of news

800
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Because

801
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,912
AT&T

802
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,216
They got a contract

803
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:17,312
About what is they got the contract for the First Responders system that

804
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,104
We have been waiting for since 911

805
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,664
Nationwide

806
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
16 years in the making

807
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,528
Now it's going to maybe start

808
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:32,672
Interested in is

809
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
Contract with B

810
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:38,816
Maxwell Air Force Base to bring the internet of things to base operations

811
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,376
Which means that they are going to

812
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,168
First off create a proof-of-concept

813
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,776
It will demonstrate smart parameters gate monitoring notifications

814
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,336
Weight management all partes making

815
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,128
You know Air Force bases more

816
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,664
I have many questions

817
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,504
Stop this and I am going to ask AT&T or maybe Maxwell Air face

818
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,528
Air Force Base

819
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,064
To talk about this because

820
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,600
1

821
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,136
It scares the bejesus outta me

822
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,696
Put sensors on our Air Force Base given the security problems

823
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
We have been happy

824
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
2

825
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,048
This is going to kill a major plot device for many

826
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
Many movies

827
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,888
Having well monitored

828
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,704
Perimeters on our bases that aren't just like

829
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,240
You know barbed wire

830
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,264
And maybe a century

831
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,824
And I'm thinking this because in stranger things

832
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,128
They had to sneak into an Arab

833
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
Air Force

834
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
It wasn't

835
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:34,368
And they were able to do so which helped Advance the plot and then to

836
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,928
I am currently watching the Americans and

837
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,744
FaZe nikan Twitter

838
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
Actually it may not be

839
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
A some sort of

840
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
Bass and

841
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
By golly they just

842
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,192
Right

843
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,752
So I'm overly distressed

844
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,104
I understand that I'm curious

845
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,384
Weather beijing today for like

846
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,432
Keep monitoring and such

847
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,712
You know probably

848
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,040
Isabel Madre

849
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,576
So what yeah yeah

850
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,600
Sitting

851
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:09,184
Then we don't know the scope of this yet

852
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,720
But I mean they could be

853
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:14,048
RFID swipe cards and such don't know yet

854
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:18,144
I'll be curious to see what they're using what the hell they're going to smartify base

855
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:23,008
Okay and as we are closing at the show the information just published

856
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,288
Lovely little story

857
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
That talks about

858
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
Google's new hardware

859
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,640
How to take on the Amazon Echo

860
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,688
The information is saying that

861
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
Google

862
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:36,064
Well combined their Google home intelligent speaker device with a mesh WiFi

863
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,088
Router such as

864
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,136
Wi-Fi Google Wi-Fi

865
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,672
Time the name

866
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
So

867
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,560
Basically this makes a lot of sense

868
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:48,864
Unless

869
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,192
This makes a lot of sense if you keep your router's Etc out

870
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,264
And I see a lot of

871
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,128
People considering making everything from light switches to speakers into Wi-Fi

872
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,456
This is not crazy

873
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
B almonds

874
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,528
3 actually is

875
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
It works

876
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,160
They actually have all the Smart Home

877
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
Hubstaff

878
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,208
The Browder itself

879
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
So

880
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
Basically sticking a speaker in your router

881
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
Yeah

882
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,728
It does make sense I'm going to look at it. I added a Google Wi-Fi unit

883
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
To the

884
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,544
Onhub that I previously purchased

885
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:33,152
I even thought about adding another Google Wi-Fi unit to expand the network further

886
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,456
It would just make sense of those could double

887
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
You know as

888
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,808
Intelligent assistance in sonder already in several rooms

889
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,368
If you can have a mesh Network right you're going to

890
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,928
Have these things in multiple rooms so maybe make sense

891
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,232
Boxes

892
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
More ports

893
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
Yay

894
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,096
That's our new theme

895
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
Okay

896
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
Well we have talked enough

897
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,936
Let us move

898
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,984
To a message from our sponsor and then

899
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
To Our Guest

900
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,080
Who is going to talk about how iot

901
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:08,480
Changes R&D everyone we are interrupting the podcast with a message from

902
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,552
Our sponsor

903
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,112
And I have Mark Wright director of product management

904
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
At Samsung

905
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,928
Arctic from the very beginning

906
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:22,560
I have heard much about Samsung artik module Hardware side and also on the cloud side

907
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,608
Can you just give me a quick overview.

908
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
Put the salt

909
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:32,032
Together for me Arctic is an antonym platform that integrates modules with security at pre-pro

910
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,616
Grand the connectivity so that they have secure transport

911
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
Into a cloud

912
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,944
So where we can virtualize products

913
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,760
We can then store data from those products

914
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,808
Control products manage those products

915
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
And then

916
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,624
It's also wrapped

917
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,464
In an API first design methodology so people can

918
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,512
Then also write strong apps

919
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,048
For those products

920
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,328
And also do connections

921
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,888
Two other services and other clouds

922
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,496
Okay so this sounds a lot like something bit manufacturers might be interested in

923
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:07,616
Systems integrators and I heard you say security a couple times so I'd love for you to talk to me

924
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,896
About what's unique

925
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,688
Cheer on Arctic

926
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,480
We have an end-to-end platform

927
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,016
For manufacturers

928
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,296
Systems integrators

929
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,112
To use in creating product iot connect

930
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,160
Good products but as We Know

931
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,464
You know from many of the reports and

932
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,816
Even things that are going on in the world right now security is top-of-mind

933
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,608
Sweetfields platform development

934
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,144
That's the best place to put

935
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,448
Security think it through at the beginning

936
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
And

937
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,496
Been implemented

938
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:40,640
And what we've implemented for security is a best-in-class methodology known as AAA security

939
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,920
It's Authentication

940
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
Authorization

941
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,736
And the ability to audit

942
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,552
So what we do there is we authenticate

943
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,856
The user and a device

944
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:56,768
So that falls into the module offering that we have right and in the software we have for that software for

945
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
Onboarding

946
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,816
The end product

947
00:38:59,328 --> 00:38:59,840
We

948
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,912
Them secure the transport into the cloud

949
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,984
So the second thing we offer is authorization

950
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,032
So what authorization is

951
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,872
Is the user that utilizing this product

952
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,712
Do they have the proper role are they authorized to do what they are trying to

953
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,040
What to do and we use certificate-based Authentication

954
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:25,440
For that process and then we have the ability to audit what has happened in addition to security what are the other benefit

955
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
Fits of having an end-to-end

956
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,560
Tell the benefits of an end-to-end platform

957
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:34,144
Are that when a manufacturer is looking at

958
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,704
Building a thing to be iot connected

959
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,240
It's a change in their business

960
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,544
Generally for a manufacturer

961
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,872
There's the electronics there's the software there's the product

962
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,920
But now on top of that they have taken

963
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:50,784
Consider RF design they have to consider protocol they have to consider cloud

964
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
We also have to consider

965
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
Mobile app development

966
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,136
And each of these

967
00:39:55,392 --> 00:40:01,280
Are additional software development efforts that they have to do on top of their normal product developer

968
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,352
So utilizing an end-to-end platform

969
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,632
Simplify stock

970
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,704
And gives them single SDK

Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your hope Stacey Higginbotham

983
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:44,288
Today's guest is Simon Bomgaars who is the co-founder and CEO of a

984
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,568
Gitlab

985
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,616
Hi Simon how are you doing

986
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,688
Hello sexy I'm good how are you

987
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,968
I am excellent

988
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
So we have you

989
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,552
Voting in all the way from Germany

990
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:59,392
And we're here to talk about what the Smart Lab of the future is in

991
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,976
What we're talking about is basically how people do research

992
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:08,352
And University labs and bio pharmaceutical Labs or maybe it's just pharmaceutical labs and biology labs

993
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,888
There's a real

994
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
Potential

995
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,704
Iot to change kind of

996
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,288
The way research is done in the lives of

997
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
People doing the research

998
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
So Simon

999
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,384
Why don't you lay it out for me

1000
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
What is the lab

1001
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
The future

1002
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
If you

1003
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,272
Singapore

1004
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,856
Have a look at the house today looks like they to get the traffic looks like

1005
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:34,720
And guess you have to to see that that's a lot of manual work involved still so

1006
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,768
And there's some apps that I cried

1007
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:43,168
Automated already for example in English pharmaceutical production so I'm like the production of a dragon

1008
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:51,616
We're closing Research Laboratories is kind of what of handwork

1009
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,640
Hand cross

1010
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,431
That that's going on there so

1011
00:41:54,687 --> 00:42:00,831
Is it 79 in the state of transition everything is going to be getting more digital

1012
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:07,231
Devices instruments in the laboratory getting more intelligent and connected to other

1013
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,023
Assassin in platforms

1014
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:15,423
This is beta Chi also look like in any area in recession chemistry

1015
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,215
Biotech

1016
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,263
And the evening and dos

1017
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:25,663
Many workers still happening lots of process will be at the alternator to end it would be easy for people

1018
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,759
Set up stay where I used to do

1019
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,783
Mendeley

1020
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:39,487
And then just let the wrong and let the black run for its also by the kitchen ultimate eating time

1021
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:43,327
Experiments and Tiny bits of data research

1022
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,703
So if for example I was I don't know preparing tissue samples by hand

1023
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,983
I might have to

1024
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,519
Scrapy

1025
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
Beat it something and then

1026
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,151
You know I'm a little pipettes dropping things in

1027
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:01,759
200 x across my samples and then sticking them somewhere and letting it grow so

1028
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,039
That's where the thing

1029
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,367
There's been Machinery like machine advances in the last couple

1030
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,135
Full of yourself

1031
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,415
Automated some of that

1032
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:13,791
It's the truth but this was all this kind of like Island solution so that they robbed a kind of

1033
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:18,399
Only liking able to do with 1 pound of Travis's like one

1034
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,423
Giacometti

1035
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,191
1

1036
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,727
Entire process

1037
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,519
That's being changed

1038
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:29,919
It's transforming into that eating dose electrostatics that you are not automated

1039
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,711
Before also can be automated

1040
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:37,855
Very easy way meaning of it will be always like kind of manual steps in between but you will be able to

1041
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:43,743
Flexibly combined different steps that you did she have to do in a laboratory. When mixing something

1042
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:48,351
Using device to device I am adding some substance substance p

1043
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,911
And we can combine these steps and

1044
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,751
Get this into a much more automated workflow

1045
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,543
So how does this change

1046
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,335
Science like how science is

1047
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,503
Of course it will be a huge change in X update on if that's going to to be produced at 6

1048
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,039
Going to the generator because

1049
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:12,671
Like alternating the workflow is not only one side and you will also be like

1050
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:16,255
That it would be awesome by July 7th

1051
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,279
Analyze

1052
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
Buy instruments

1053
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,167
Flow back to the tuna to the researcher

1054
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,727
So that's that his task will be more

1055
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,847
Really analyzing them then they sat and then actually generating it so now I would say

1056
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:35,199
The time research has bands in the lab doing experiments using his hands

1057
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,015
Shaking the reagent tubes

1058
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,575
That model S 60 to 70%

1059
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,927
This will be in the future. Maybe only 10% or 20% of his time

1060
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:50,047
The rest of this time will be more on the side of analyzing the data going really index

1061
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,863
There was a chance of data crunching

1062
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,423
I'm finding more details

1063
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,983
Happy overlooked before because the data was not that

1064
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:04,383
Stan's and not that affect quality and it's it's becoming to automated data generation

1065
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,479
Wow okay so then how does that change the skills needed

1066
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
A scientist

1067
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,063
Become a scientist

1068
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,879
I had four really boring repetitive work but

1069
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,743
So what

1070
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,791
Do you need to know

1071
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,911
I guess some people will read it misses a day today at work

1072
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:33,311
I think I still think it's it's a good skill to to have to to know what's really going on in lap so because of

1073
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,383
Comedian stand for

1074
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:42,527
But yeah you're right I mean it will be more like you'd like to discuss a recession

1075
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:48,927
The future is like not really analyzing data and being a prostitute

1076
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:55,327
Connect data from different sources to make the available or not

1077
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,607
Another way that they do it right now

1078
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:03,007
It would be more in front of the computer

1079
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,287
Standing in the laptop

1080
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:08,895
Okay it what does this mean for sciences that involve going out into

1081
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:13,503
The real world for part of the time I'm thinking of like you nobody your geology year

1082
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:19,391
I don't know the people go check to Antarctica to pull up by scores of the world

1083
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,927
How does that change

1084
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,695
Their jobs

1085
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,463
Out in the world

1086
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:29,119
What is just out going upstairs now much more material

1087
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:35,519
Toys R Us to Manchester

1088
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,311
Do something

1089
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:43,711
Video of selling animals in the wild Zora digging in the soil or something

1090
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:50,111
Something at Aeropostale has been not saying she would not be done by robots in the future so that's something that's it

1091
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,439
What is the Subspace for adventure Inn in research

1092
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
Okay

1093
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,023
What about it

1094
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,351
Let's think about

1095
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,263
We talked about kind of skills as a scientist does this mean they'll spend less time overall in the lab cuz I think about

1096
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,567
The Graduate students in their lives are like

1097
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,103
Pretty awful in Subway

1098
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,431
Nazareth are married to their lives in

1099
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,455
Trying to

1100
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,759
Perform experiments does that change things

1101
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:23,391
Well yeah I think so but nothing else it's so it's right I mean I can experience it

1102
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:30,047
I was wondering why I still have to dissect to some insects and like each other mind some plans and

1103
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:36,447
Lisa plants something

1104
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:40,543
Aquatic exercise to get some basic skills

1105
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:45,663
In the lab to see what's really going on to it to really understand how some things work and then I

1106
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,199
But at the same time I think.

1107
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,991
Time the people

1108
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
Spans

1109
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:56,415
On

1110
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,743
I think it's going to be much more important in the future

1111
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
All right

1112
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:04,095
In what about obstacles to making all of this worked

1113
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:09,727
Because you mentioned earlier that tanks were essentially siloed and now things are kind of coming together a little bit more

1114
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,031
How is that happening are people

1115
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:15,103
Killik scientist build so much of their own stuff

1116
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,383
Their budget constraint

1117
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,407
Really smart

1118
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,687
How old is come about

1119
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:23,551
I think actually in comparison to other areas the lab environment

1120
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,087
Snow in Byram

1121
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,903
It's also why it because lost it

1122
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:35,839
Builds for for for ages like ability to endure

1123
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:42,239
I mean the depreciation time for for Terry devices at 15 years old

1124
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:46,847
Everyone with being in the lab most attended a lot of all the equipment around in this

1125
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:53,247
All the cooking going to be able to connect Xfinity software iot

1126
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:59,903
So this is definitely an obstacle that you have a lot of older cooking the wrong and yeah you're right I mean

1127
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:05,279
Like ideas DIY people and then blockable their own stuff so

1128
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:10,143
But it's just getting more and more tools available so that people can actually connect

1129
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,703
What day does to other environments

1130
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:19,103
Proprietary system software problem that's the steel manufacturers out there that think that

1131
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:25,503
They can build their own solution that the best applications for fall for devices and epidemiology is only going to stay with

1132
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:31,903
I don't think

1133
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,695
Laboratory equipment

1134
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:40,095
Now you guys created that folder is actually a company that helps bring together disparate parts of the lab so can you tell me a little

1135
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,143
If it's not hardware-based

1136
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
Can you think of software

1137
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,959
Softworks

1138
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,751
Can you tell me just a little bit

1139
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:47,519
What you're doing there

1140
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:52,127
We started to build a electronic lock

1141
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,711
Replace the paper that people

1142
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,527
Used to like that they don't

1143
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,319
On Lake Valley today.

1144
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:03,135
Why do they turn into PhD accessibility office

1145
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:08,255
But we soon realized that building an addition

1146
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,839
I don't like this

1147
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,655
Piece of the entire workflow

1148
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,215
But in reality it's reader

1149
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:21,823
The car off the entire left environment because of connect so my sister.

1150
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:28,479
Center of data is collected or being at the store

1151
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:32,063
But also the center where baby kitten experiments are planned

1152
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
So

1153
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:40,255
Flexing after having that we we should get that people also want to have a

1154
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:43,071
Repository to Saudi

1155
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,119
Standard procedures

1156
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,703
Stand By the Sea one thing led to the other and now we're

1157
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:56,127
Yes I'm kind of splat for Mrs because of the operating system for Laboratory

1158
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:00,479
Being able to connect to devices and receive data from devices

1159
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,503
So that's basically

1160
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,039
Throw it away.

1161
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,831
If we were

1162
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,927
Science is right now dealing with a replication

1163
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,743
Were they just can't reproduce the experiments

1164
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,559
The same way that they had in the past

1165
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,583
And

1166
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:19,679
I'm very curious how it is having this level of granular data and

1167
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,215
More objective data

1168
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
Well

1169
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,543
Maybe help solve this problem

1170
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:28,383
Yes sir I I really think so because

1171
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:34,783
This application

1172
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,391
Already too much data from too many different sauces around

1173
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:45,791
Pieper electric problems managing this situation

1174
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
Cancel data

1175
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:52,959
Just needs to the possibility that people can treat that a tire or only showed those results that they

1176
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:57,055
Infected area hypothesis

1177
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:00,127
And I really think that's giving people a platform

1178
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:03,455
So that a tattoo to reading manage their research data

1179
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,527
And also do this and that in the easy and transparent way

1180
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,807
Reedy house

1181
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:14,207
To change the mindset the Plex on the TV can collect data and combination within within two alike with it with an

1182
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:14,975
Environment

1183
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,279
Either they have two EZ shouted

1184
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:21,375
They actually are the most straightforward way to just solving two-step problem

1185
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,167
All right

1186
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,191
Thank you Simon

1187
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,727
And I am so glad we had this

1188
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,519
Yes me too

1189
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:34,175
