This week sponsor is Nordic semiconductor

42
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,960
Are you planning to build a product using cellular iot technology

43
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,032
Check out the NRF 9160

44
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
It's the most advanced multimode cellular iot device in the market today it supports the two cellular stand

45
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
Standards for iot applications

46
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,504
Lte-m

47
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,808
And narrowband iot

48
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
A single device

49
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,952
It also supports up to 15 LTE bands making it truly globally compatible

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,328
It also has on-chip GPS which makes it ideal for any asset tracking and monitoring a

51
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
Application

52
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,752
Bus application power and security come in the form of arms latest cortex and 33 CPU

53
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,312
An arm's trustzone security

54
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,920
With one megabyte of Flash and 256 GB of RAM

55
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,528
They're integrated RF front ends and adaptive Power Manager dsip

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,648
The NRF 9160 is your first consideration when designing cellular iot

Heaven

63
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:51,520
First off I have to tell everybody I am now in my home studio on Bainbridge Island

64
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,824
Yay yay

65
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,384
All the craziness is now behind me

66
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
Some of the craziness is still ahead of me

67
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
Such a setting up my smart home

68
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
Work so you can expect to hear more

69
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
About all of that

70
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
Probably in the next week or two

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,696
People have asked about that previously before you

72
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
I think you just

73
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,536
Mention last week when you miss the most

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
I did and yes

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
But it is not the first thing

76
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,960
I think what I took out all the stuff I realized

77
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
How much moving a smart home

78
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,104
Process of moving impact

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,128
Singing organized most

80
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
I'm sitting here looking at my boxes of

81
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,992
Surface word

82
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
But I don't want to set it up right

83
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
Rent rent

84
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
Anyway let's start the show with

85
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
Updates on

86
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
Read this is

87
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Great news

88
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
It's big news

89
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,072
Thread is a wireless radio protocol

90
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,888
The things that you would need to know about thread is it

91
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
It is IPv6

92
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,008
Compatible which means you can go straight up

93
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
And it is low power

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,408
So this is a network that competes with things like zigbee Bluetooth

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
Z-Wave

96
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,808
We talked about it before what's exciting about it is actually a whole new protocol just for the Smart Home

97
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,856
The folks at Nest Samsung

98
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
Deep bands

99
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,952
And a couple other companies

100
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
Designed it several years ago

101
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
And we've been waiting for it to like really take off

102
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
It really has

103
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
And with red

104
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:27,263
1.2 this is their latest version of thread they've done three things

105
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
They're really

106
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
Interesting

107
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
So first off

108
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
They've been working on this for 3

109
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
Little longer

110
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,319
I think the first thread device or capable device I saw was the original Google

111
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
Onhub router

112
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
Oh wow yeah that

113
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
You still have that

114
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,231
That I do not I replace with a regular Google Wi-Fi

115
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
Just kidding

116
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
I'm so excited for you

117
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
But no

118
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
Nope

119
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Okay

120
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
So let's talk about this

121
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,031
Three main things that thread 1.2

122
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
It is

123
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
Lowering the power requirement

124
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
So it extends the battery life of iot

125
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,015
Yay it puts it in the same

126
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
World is Bluetooth

127
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,367
The other thing it's done

128
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,439
Is a credit extensions for Bluetooth low in

129
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
Which means

130
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,559
That this protocol will work over Bluetooth radios

131
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,911
This means that if you have a Bluetooth bass device as a note on your network

132
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,727
You can actually have it talk to your

133
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Sprint network

134
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
Provided

135
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
There's another note

136
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
Thread Network that speaks

137
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
That sounds really complicated

138
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
But it's actually not

139
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,015
No it's kind of like if you have a fax machine need to

140
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,855
Have somebody else that has a fax machine to or you can use it that makes sense to me

141
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
The real question is

142
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:52,767
Is it backwards compatible with existing Bluetooth devices on the mortgage

143
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
It is

144
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,375
No new hardware required

145
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
You're probably going to have to have a firmware update list

146
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
You've got like a brand new device

147
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,031
Got a chip that already has a firmware in it but

148
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,079
It will work with your old Bluetooth stuff

149
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
Bluetooth low energy

150
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,127
This is

151
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,271
Cool what it can do is if you have maybe a Bluetooth sensor for example and you wanted to work with your

152
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,831
Thread based air conditioning or your threat

153
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
Lights

154
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
It will actually

155
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,719
Become part of that Network so that sensor could easily communicate

156
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
With those lights

157
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Yay

158
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
Awesome

159
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
Yeah it is awesome

160
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,399
And then the other thing that they've done is

161
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
They call it commercial extension

162
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
Chance and there's two things they did he

163
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,775
The first part is they've made it

164
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
Possible to have

165
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
Larger networks of thread device

166
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,871
Places to thread Taps out

167
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,431
An individual Network at around 300

168
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Devices is kind of

169
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
The General

170
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
Which is a lie

171
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,599
Yeah it's plenty for a home but not forsake an Enterprise

172
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
Right word

173
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
It's a really big hug

174
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
I'm like

175
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,207
I'm kind of surprised I mean I have like

176
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255
My other house did you get there

177
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,351
Butera my current house has no light bulbs there are no light bulbs in this house it's really weird

178
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,631
Summer jobs don't have a

179
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
Almost none of my Tinder

180
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
Yeah I don't know what that is

181
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,775
What has a head a t light

182
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
So I can see if you had like

183
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,407
80 Light Bulbs Plus temperature sensors and all these other things

184
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
And you had a larger house that I had

185
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
You could probably get to

186
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
350

187
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
The point is

188
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,879
Now you're not limited by that what happens is

189
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439
They created like a virtual overlay so

190
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
A

191
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
Physical Network

192
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
Thread devices

193
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
Talk to

194
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
The router

195
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
And you can join them

196
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
Up with another physical one so

197
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
When you're talking to like that

198
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
IP addresses you can actually address

199
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,567
All 700 or all however mininet

200
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,359
Works you have as one Unified

201
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
So

202
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,431
Many networks now look like when

203
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
That's very

204
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
And then

205
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
This is the

206
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
Somebody

207
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,183
They've added enterprise-grade lifecycle device management

208
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
So

209
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,047
In the home when I connect a thread device I do QR code why do some

210
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
That right

211
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
In the Enterprise that is stupid

212
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Because

213
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
You don't want everybody to be able

214
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
How to add devices

215
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,799
So they've tied in with Cisco

216
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
Some other open protocols to give you admin

217
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
Rights for

218
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
Commissioning and decommissioning

219
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Devices

220
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,623
That's probably a lot quicker to I wouldn't want to be going around in Enterprise and scanning a QR code for every single device that I was trying to

221
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Choi

222
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:33,279
Can you imagine like having a good day

223
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
Efficient

224
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
Where's the QR code

225
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
So that's what threads done

226
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
And to provide some context here

227
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,591
To me this looks like a continual

228
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Want to say

229
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
Retrenchment is

230
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,735
The smart home isn't going where we all kind of hoped it

231
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
We go

232
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
It is becoming

233
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,855
Much more locked into these Fender ecosystems built

234
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Voice assist

235
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Silence

236
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:06,303
And the wireless protocols that we were like I'll be open and cool and everything will talk to each other that's not

237
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,119
So it makes sense that thread would say

238
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
If we want to remain relevant we got to go to

239
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
Verizon Bluetooth is actually

240
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
Dummy

241
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
Did there still fine in the

242
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,591
And everywhere else but they've also made of

243
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
Branch out in

244
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Price

245
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
So

246
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
That's I guess the context you

247
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:29,343
Yeah I've always looked at it from the smart home perspective cuz I've been out of Enterprise for 15 years

248
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
I've been waiting to see

249
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
Some thread implementation

250
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:38,303
At the device level that would be make me go wow this is awesome got to have it and haven't seen that yet

251
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,095
But again that you said

252
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,911
Everything's going Wi-Fi Bluetooth

253
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
Silo digital assistant

254
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
So

255
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
In automatic

256
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
So hopefully

257
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
We hear about soon some

258
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Rehabilitation

259
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:57,759
In the threat group has like osram and Zeidman's they're actually they join the Border

260
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
So

261
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
You know this isn't crazy

262
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,391
It makes a lot of sense +

263
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
Unlike zippy

264
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,999
Which is it doesn't go out to

265
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
CB is very popular

266
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
In the Enterprise

267
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
It's not IPv6

268
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
Compatible so you still have to make that

269
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Next

270
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
Where is thread is

271
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
So

272
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
It'll Tire Lake lighting system

273
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Some directly into

274
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,919
You know what we're going to get all the haters now because they always say you're always

275
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
Disinfecting and we're not doing that

276
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,527
It's just a technical limitation that some people

277
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Can't work with

278
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
Yeah I mean

279
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
I'm not dissing

280
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
I have no

281
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Feelings whatsoever

282
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
Positive or negative

283
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,559
So you thread the one other piece of news that they released this week

284
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
Switch on the smart home side is interesting is

285
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
Lutron has joined the

286
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
Thread

287
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Word

288
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,079
So yeah but which I enjoyed the thread group supported Iraq

289
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
And

290
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,895
The first thing I thought was

291
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
Holy mackerel

292
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
What's going to happen to Lucia

293
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
Proprietary protocols

294
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
Which

295
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
Clear connect

296
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
And then

297
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
Fancier larger

298
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
Professional installations they have

299
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
Radio raw 2

300
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
And

301
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
I don't know I reached out to Lutron they have

302
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Have not gotten

303
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
But I will also as a hint

304
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
Say that

305
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,495
Recently they released the Aurora product

306
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
Which works with

307
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
JPay

308
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
Which is the same radio that

309
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Runs over

310
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,663
They released this product that

311
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,455
Hold your light switch open

312
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,551
For your hue light bulbs that works with a hue light bulb system using

313
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,391
So I saw that was like Hey That's not using Lutron

314
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
Interesting

315
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
And now it's loose when turning

316
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,303
Do I think they totally ditch their proprietary protocol

317
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
Probably not

318
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
But

319
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
I like the fact

320
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,215
I thought they might be working more broadly with a more open today

321
00:11:54,751 --> 00:12:00,895
Stick on kind of clamps

322
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,455
Right yeah it's a round dimmer switch that

323
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
You screw it it's

324
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
It's like tension mounted

325
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,063
Screw it

326
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
Onto your

327
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
Lights

328
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
Switch but there's no wiring

329
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
It's $40

330
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:17,535
I actually have it in front of me in the second I get my Hue bulbs in which is going to happen this weekend

331
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
Can I test this out so weak

332
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
We can all see

333
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,751
Yates by the way that only works with the toggle

334
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Switches that stick out for them

335
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,407
Yeah traditional light switch

336
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Warrant wine

337
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
Okay

338
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,527
Well it's okay you won't see that you won't see the old ugly light switch anymore

339
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,575
That's true you see a beautiful dimmer switch

340
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Okay

341
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
Let's talk about more enterprisenews

342
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Man this is exciting

343
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,559
Jll which is a

344
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Real estate

345
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
Behemoth

346
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,263
They've teamed up with Google Assistant to create a smart assistant

347
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
Four offices

348
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
So this is like

349
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,407
Asking hey assistant is the conference room open

350
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
And getting an answer

351
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
This is

352
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,319
Dick Amazon is working with other companies to try to bring

353
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,415
Listen to businesses so is Microsoft with Cortana that's actually where

354
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
Are most likely to Secor

355
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Cortana succeed

356
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,327
And lo and behold Google's just like sweat. In

357
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
And made this work

358
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,751
Yeah and I remember when I used to work at Google I go into the New York City office once a week

359
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
We didn't use

360
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
Google Assistant

361
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Carpenters and such

362
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
It was an automated

363
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
System

364
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,479
Using the Google Calendar what not you could search

365
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
Say find me a room from

366
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
This time this time it's open

367
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
I'd like to have

368
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,927
Video whiteboard or video calling whatever

369
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,719
And the system will just do it I mean

370
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
Basically they had everything

371
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,327
There but the voice capability right

372
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
So

373
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:01,727
I'm not surprised at that Google is the want to do this today probably didn't take much effort to extend what they already have

374
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,799
Yes indeed jll they managed offices

375
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,847
Like we said their system is called Jill

376
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:13,759
Of course it is in there because I have been given to understand that you really were

377
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,087
Want a double or triple syllable word is your voice assistant

378
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Because it's harder to

379
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
It's easier for the AI to differentiate

380
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,255
Which I have to say hey Jill

381
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
Hey Jill

382
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
Book me up

383
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
Okay don't butcher my

384
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
Kevin can handle a lot of my singing

385
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
All right

386
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
So that you're a bad singer it's what you're doing to the world

387
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Yeah okay

388
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:50,111
This is on your smartphone this is not actually on a physical device in the room

389
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Just yet

390
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
This is

391
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
Download the app

392
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
But it does bring in stuff

393
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
You would normally

394
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
I need to do like Hayes

395
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Are these deaths Abuela

396
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
Book me a task if

397
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Hot desking

398
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Place

399
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,823
I like the fact that even though it runs on Google Cloud on the back that's obviously using

400
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Google

401
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:18,015
It doesn't just integrate with G Suite calendars it also will integrate with Microsoft 365 which is obvious

402
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,807
The Behemoth of

403
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Activity Suites

404
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,159
It is it the Kraken of office

405
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
Sweets

406
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Yes

407
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,047
So they're trying this out with customers one of the first customers is going to be

408
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Procter & gamb

409
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
My Hope Is

410
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
I actually

411
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:41,055
Reached out to the jll team

412
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
How people are actually using this

413
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
If

414
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
People are actually

415
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,431
So hopefully that will happen

416
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
All right

417
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
Moving right along

418
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Dish

419
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,087
The satellite company satellite TV is

420
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,183
They have launched a smart

421
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
Home Services Unit

422
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,791
And they're going to basically come in and help

423
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
Set up your smartphone

424
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,167
They will be working with Nest ring

425
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Linksys

426
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
Rio 2

427
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
And a couple audio companies

428
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,895
Comcast has been doing this for a while AT&T and Verizon both started these business units but they

429
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,735
Actually backed out of them so Comcast is only one I know if it's doing it right

430
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Indeed

431
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Diospi space

432
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,647
I don't see this as a big Market I think that's why

433
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:32,255
The others were already in it at scaled-back so surprised at this is doing this

434
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,839
There are definitely people who just like you to hate 7-Eleven

435
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,679
But I don't think it's a large percentage of people because the products these days

436
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
Pretty easy to set up

437
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
Yes

438
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
And

439
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,335
Are we still going to do what the Amazon

440
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
Guided for you and like

441
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
What kind of routine is Yuan

442
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
Richest device setup

443
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
For like

444
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Routines

445
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
And that sort of thing

446
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Okay

447
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
So and I will say

448
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
You may not be aware of the

449
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
Does Kevin butt dishes

450
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
Shed

451
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
They have not done it yet

452
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,559
But they are said they're going to launch an NB iot

453
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
So

454
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
Yeah I could see that and it would tie into this yes

455
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,799
They're vying for the Spectrum from

456
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
T-Mobile Sprint

457
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,639
If it was to get together and have to divest some things

458
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,455
Even look at the Boost Mobile

459
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
Investment as well so

460
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
Yeah okay

461
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:32,159
I don't know if this is going to be huge but you also a man think about like alarm.com has done

462
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
Pretty good job building

463
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,047
A smart phone capability as well now they offer the devices

464
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
Exact services

465
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
Sodus Vivint

466
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
So yeah it's

467
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,447
I don't know I mean

468
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
I think there is a market

469
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
For this sort of thing

470
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,335
I don't know how big it is I think there's lots of little independent

471
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
Companies that was won in Austin

472
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,639
Smart House

473
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
H o u

474
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
Smart home systems

475
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
4 people and I

476
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,343
Actually think there's

477
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
There's a tiny

478
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,719
I don't know the scale but I think it feels more like a Consulting

479
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
I agree

480
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
But we'll see

481
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
Let's talk security

482
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
Because OMG

483
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
The world went nuts

484
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
This week

485
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215
Because they noticed

486
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
Because Samsung

487
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
Told them

488
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,639
Samsung tweeted something that will read word for word in a second

489
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,431
Potentially that the Tweet witch

490
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,223
Is really interesting in and of itself

491
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,295
So I don't have any Samsung Smart TV that I have you do

492
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
I do not

493
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
I'm sure some of our listeners to

494
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,439
So this is the Tweet that's Samsung support USA Center

495
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,303
Scanning your computer for malware viruses is important to keep it running smoothly

496
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,935
This is also true for your qled TV if it's connected to Wi-Fi

497
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,751
Prevent malicious software texting your TV

498
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
Scanning for viruses

499
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,823
Is on your TV every few weeks

500
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Here's how

501
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,871
That's

502
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
Not smart Samsung

503
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,247
So I think a lot of people if they saw that tweet we're like

504
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,319
Why do they send it I could have viruses on my

505
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Sure you could

506
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
So and yes

507
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,487
Smart TVs are in Notorious place for

508
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
Pirates SB

509
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Because they're not up to

510
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,399
Some people might be like gay Samsung pointing out that there's fire the antivirus

511
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,055
I don't think we want to live in a future where are connected devices are so badly engineered

512
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,847
We have to run virus scan

513
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Yeah

514
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Enter

515
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:33,503
Samsung Smart TVs run Samsung tizen

516
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:38,367
So it's not a platform to talk about offense it's probably not a platform that really is

517
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:42,975
Attacked all that much either because I should know it was attack remember they had like

518
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,279
40 security vulnerabilities in

519
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,095
Because Samsung originally wanted everything

520
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Right that's right

521
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,935
That's right I do recall that

522
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,495
That was for about 2 years ago

523
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,359
I haven't heard about it since then that's kind of why I was like

524
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,967
But you're right it wasn't engineer with security in mind I would say

525
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Yasso

526
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,831
When we're doing our Sonos I just put this on the show that says this is a bad fuse

527
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
This is a future I don't want

528
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
But

529
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
For me

530
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
I don't

531
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,559
Connect my TV to the internet I instead use a Roku and connect it to the internet via real

532
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
I also

533
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
Another option here

534
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,703
It would help is I know I've been skeptical

535
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,495
That maybe this sort of thing will change my

536
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
Is having a connected

537
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
Service that

538
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,359
Monitors are

539
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,967
And says hey did you know your TV is sending Dobbs of data

540
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,015
Not just when it's on but to weird places

541
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,599
Malaysia I'm so glad you said that because

542
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,671
I'm hoping we're going to review a product that will help with that

543
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:50,559
Want to get into right now but I'm looking for something along those lines and we stumbled upon one

544
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
Earlier this morning

545
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,375
You should just tell people what it is

546
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Excited

547
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
Look at themselves

548
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
Now I don't

549
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
Oh you're such a tease

550
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,799
I'll tell people cuz I

551
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
It's called the firewalla

552
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
Yes and I think it was

553
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,943
Cisco people to put it together it

554
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:13,343
To be honest it's like a consumer derivative of something like that you could do on your own with a Raspberry Pi if you wanted to

555
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,159
Silversmith plug-and-play and you have to worry about

556
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,208
Setting up your figuring coating etcetera

557
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
But it does

558
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:24,096
Many things I'm one of the thing says yes it's monitoring where your traffic is going from all your devices

559
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,168
So something like that could help and then you could be like

560
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,472
Holy cow it's time to run virus scan

561
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,752
And get rid of those on my

562
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
Ideally

563
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,360
If you're going to make something smart you need to make acid

564
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
Secure as well

565
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,176
I didn't know you were set top.box person

566
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,736
Yeah I mean I've been a core cutter forever and

567
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,808
Same here same here I use to Android TVs

568
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,368
Nvidia Shield or iWatch directly on my Chromebook

569
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:51,232
I do have both a Fire TV stick and a Chromecast but we actually don't use them

570
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,792
We're pretty simple we only have one TV in our

571
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
House

572
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,888
I'm not going to tell you how many we have how many strings are here

573
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,168
Well you know I guess we

574
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Peking watch

575
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Amazon Echo Show

576
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
Okay

577
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,616
Let's talk about other security

578
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Kevin

579
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,688
TPM

580
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,784
TPM trusted platform module and I said this

581
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,624
Adderall 5 times in the last 2 years

582
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,464
I want trusted platform module in my iot devices

583
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
Why do I want that

584
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
Because

585
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:30,400
The same reason I have them and want them in my Chromebooks that I did was praise she should tell people what it is

586
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,704
Trusted platform module

587
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:39,872
So basically it is a specific chip although I think it can be implemented

588
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,920
Coprocessor

589
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,968
And I say I'm thinking yes

590
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Yes

591
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
Either way

592
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
It's an Authentication

593
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
Basically

594
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,464
It has cryptographically stored keys

595
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
That

596
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,792
Protect your device from having say the

597
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:02,656
Operating system Flash without your knowledge or tweak without your knowledge where maybe a virus could

598
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:06,496
Actually say wet install this routine and get all the information from your computer

599
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
Behind the scenes

600
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,336
What does several

601
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:14,432
Things are very low-level but at a high-level it protects your device from being

602
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:18,016
Change without your knowledge purification systems of the yes

603
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,344
This is working as intended is not an acid cetera

604
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
Got it

605
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
So I'm curious because

606
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
In the world of can

607
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,208
Computing arm

608
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,000
For example has a trusted

609
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
At The Trestle

610
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,120
And they have that actually on microcontroller switches

611
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
One of the challenges of these types of

612
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,448
Devices that don't work

613
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
No resource

614
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
Devices so things with microphone

615
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
Controllers without

616
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
And so

617
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,408
Arm has had something and they brought it down to the MCU

618
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
And

619
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,296
Nxp in a couple other microcontroller makers are now implementing

620
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
So you can buy these

621
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,744
I wonder if there's a difference though with the trust in zone because I think like to the iPhone where they have the trusted Enclave for your finger

622
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,584
My understanding I can very well be wrong is that doze

623
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
Zones

624
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
AR for storing

625
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Protective

626
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:11,520
Data not for verifying the system

627
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,312
Has or hasn't been compromised

628
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,848
So trust so

629
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,408
It will run a check

630
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
To make sure

631
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,736
It's basically a Sandbox to run

632
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
Secure

633
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,808
Program so you can run an app

634
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,368
In that area so you can load the app in that area

635
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
And nothing can modify

636
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,744
Okay so there is a slight difference in please a TPM is

637
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,864
It's not a Sandbox it doesn't run app verifies like the BIOS

638
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,424
Okay so then that sounds like

639
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,960
I just read about it

640
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,080
And they don't do it on a processor side they do it on the flash memory size

641
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
Which is

642
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,408
When is something gets in over the air update

643
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
For example

644
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
It checks it and says

645
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,736
Hey this is actually fun

646
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,320
Right way to use Etc

647
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
Does it have signed keys

648
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,904
And is it trying to change some

649
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
Something

650
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
Mission Beach

651
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
Change

652
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,512
So that happened but that's on the memory size

653
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
So I think

654
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,352
I agree with you

655
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
I think we have to be a lot smarter to

656
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,424
Figure out the proper

657
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
Mechanism

658
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
To do this

659
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
But I'm with you

660
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
We do need this sort of

661
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Functionality

662
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:23,456
Yeah it's me it's it's not going to protect my iot data it's not going to stop something from sending data somewhere else

663
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,784
Right

664
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,112
Is malicious prevent someone from trying to take over your

665
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,648
Your device

666
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
We're all in agreement

667
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
Unsure

668
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
The right

669
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Do it

670
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Imagine

671
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,144
Everybody's going to have a slightly different take

672
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,704
But feel free to talk to us if you're smarter than this

673
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,264
Cuz we're working our way through it

674
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,288
Slowly but surely

675
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,360
All right let's do some quick news bits

676
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,152
Kevin iPhone camera

677
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,712
IPhone camera so a paper

678
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,528
By the Royal Society of chemistry

679
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,112
Is coming soon get ready yet

680
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,672
They demonstrate the use of an iPhone

681
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,232
And thin-film Jamaica

682
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Spectrometer

683
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,632
Spectrometry sensor

684
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
Okay

685
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
Yes

686
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,496
So basically what they're doing is they're using the Flash

687
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,544
I have an iPhone and it's thin

688
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
Film

689
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
2

690
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,128
Hold some type of

691
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,688
Bodily fluid or DNA Etc

692
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,736
And what they can do is

693
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,272
Literally performance

694
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,576
Imma treat analysis

695
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,136
On the iPhone with it

696
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
I was kind of cool

697
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
It is cool

698
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:42,816
Another update is on Ikea blinds we had talked to your block who's head of the

699
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
Ikea

700
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
Smart home efforts

701
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,448
He told us that these smart blinds that were also excited about

702
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,984
Is there going to be cheaper and

703
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
From Ikea

704
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,824
Those are delayed

705
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
And they were going to be out in August

706
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,944
They're still going to be out in August in Europe but in the US we're going to see

707
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,968
October 1st

708
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,992
Launch date

709
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
And yet still cool

710
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,136
All right we still we still don't have a price on those two

711
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
We don't

712
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,952
I think if they're going to be about a hundred

713
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,048
Okay and it depends on the size

714
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
What about this homekit

715
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:21,984
Can I look for you I'll get folks you can now

716
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
Jewelsmart

717
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Outlet

718
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,360
From Hitachi and I don't know if I'm saying that correctly

719
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
It's

720
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,736
Just like any other smart home Outlet it's a dual plug so you turn one of your

721
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
Plugs into

722
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
Two outlets

723
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,832
And then you can control

724
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:41,696
Tyson application because it's

725
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,000
Obviously it's WiFi

726
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:48,096
Apple

727
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
That is true

728
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,424
I see a price it is

729
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,520
T999 which sounds like a lot for Smart Eye leopard again

730
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,056
You kind of getting to outlets

731
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,080
In that one device

732
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,152
Alright and hey

733
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
Bixby is it bad

734
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,272
Was it ever here

735
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,576
Specifically the Galaxy home

736
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,392
The fondue pot speaker with Bixby built in

737
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,792
Oh yeah that's yeah the Galaxy home oh yeah they announce that what are you

738
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,328
It's still not for sale

739
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,216
It still isn't but rumor has it that Samsung will be debuting its next

740
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,264
Galaxy Note 10

741
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:33,152
On August 7th in New York invited not going out but The Insider scoop is that

742
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
August 7th is the date

743
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:39,808
I am going to predict we finally see the Galaxy with a ship date

744
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,832
Where the price

745
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,696
And probably a little baby Galaxy home because I've been SEC filings for something

746
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,488
Smaller and smaller fondue pot

747
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,512
Kind of like the

748
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,816
Echo mini or the

749
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,864
Like a warm case of chafing dish

750
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,912
There you go exactly one chip at a time

751
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
Thank you Bixby

752
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,240
Awesome alright we

753
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
Try that or not

754
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,360
I have no I don't know if anybody will at this

755
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:07,712
All right and then find a little bit of news Amazon is being sued

756
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
4

757
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,016
Privacy violations

758
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
Kids

759
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,832
This is actually something we've

760
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Talked about in the

761
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
Switches

762
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,208
The children's online protection and something something

763
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Privacy Act

764
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
Privacy.

765
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
Privacy protection

766
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
Protection and Privacy Act

767
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
Prevents

768
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,936
Japanese from Gathering data from children under the age of

769
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
13

770
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
And

771
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,544
A long time ago when I had my echo device I was like hey

772
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,360
Recording my daughter's voice she is not yet

773
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,408
That feels like Batman

774
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
I like that

775
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,504
The FTC actually did a

776
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,064
Noted like a year maybe

777
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
A year-and-a-half ago that said

778
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,928
We're not super worried as long as your

779
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
Selling that

780
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
But

781
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,768
Two lawsuits were filed

782
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
Last week in Seattle

783
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
All that said

784
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,864
Hey you know what this is a problem

785
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,168
And it's a problem for a couple reasons

786
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
They basically said that Amazon is

787
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,240
Recording all of these boys

788
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
Friends of Children

789
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,288
And

790
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,312
That's not

791
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,616
Cool it's without their consent or the consent of

792
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Their parents

793
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,712
They are saying that Amazon's privacy policies

794
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,736
Isn't this is the important thing

795
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:16,064
Sing to me that say if you use the Amazon

796
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,344
Echo device

797
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,368
And talk to madam

798
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
M a

799
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
You're basically

800
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
Consenting

801
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
To this

802
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
Privacy

803
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,048
If you don't accept it you may not user

804
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
But

805
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,864
The lawsuit is saying

806
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,192
In the you here because this is a device that's in a household

807
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
Are all people in the household

808
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,008
Consenting to this

809
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
No

810
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
Probably not

811
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,336
Which is kind of interesting because

812
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:42,176
I often consent to privacy policies on behalf of my entire home

813
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
And you know

814
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
I can see my husband being

815
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,040
No

816
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
So

817
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,648
And what about guess what about people just come over to your house

818
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Yeah

819
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,696
I never thought of that

820
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,232
To be honest from the consent stand for

821
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,048
Yeah I mean it's a mean if you have like my mom

822
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
She is very privacy

823
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
She does not like

824
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,192
My house she actually will walk through my house like

825
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
Turning off the mic

826
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,752
Even though she knows she's like

827
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
Physical kill switches

828
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,432
There's a lot of meat here in this lawsuit and

829
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
You know it's worth

830
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,992
Look at the following song

831
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Put them in there

832
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,040

833

That's this weekend iot news

But think it's time to go to our voicemail what do you think

835
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:30,304
I do and even though it's the middle of June we actually have to go back a month

00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
We got a winner for May

837
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:36,448
Yes we forgot the May winner partially because we had pre-recorded an episode

838
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
It doesn't matter

839
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,360
We still have a prize for

840
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920

Yay

843
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
In the May winner was

844
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,088
Lynn and we actually answered his question last week Solin

00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,880

Question

870
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,616
Witches from Jeff

871
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
Let's hear it

872
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,944
Hi Stacy and Kevin

873
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,736
The question is

874
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,680
Longest wait is was cuddling on the counter and

875
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:20,896
Clever and make sure that you know Amazon order

876
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,176
Make targets music

877
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,528
Exporting answering keep up the great work

878
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,320
Turquoise Adidas on the Shelf thank you

879
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:34,976
So we got this question like once every 6 months and I love this question because it kind of confirms what I've been saying we have to

880
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,792
Too many smart speakers in the house cluttering up every single

881
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:44,192
Would you can do something about that Jeff as you said you know you asked if they're ceiling mounts are any lights

882
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,520
There are several ceiling mounts available for either

883
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,800
Echo dots

884
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,848
Home Minis

885
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,176
Witcher similarly-sized what did you have to buy the proper amount for it

886
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:58,272
I'm not going to recommend one because there's so many to choose from on Amazon

887
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:02,112
They're all run around 15 to $18 each

888
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,416
It doesn't look too difficult to install in fact

889
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:09,792
Some people that would recommend these two if

890
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,608
That'll get your speaker out of the way

891
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,144
Up in the ceiling

892
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,728
If you want if you don't feel like installing anything for about the same price

893
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,800
There's a couple vendors on Amazon that also make

894
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,360
Plug-in modules that you literally

895
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,920
It's a mount system and you mount your

896
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:32,320
Smart speaker small smart speaker to the wall essentially you plug this into an outlet and your speaker sits on top of it and it's plugged in

897
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,672
So that way you don't have cords all over either and it's out of the way

898
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
You good

899
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,816
As far as other devices with smart speakers that can remove the traditional ones

900
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:47,168
I know Stacy you tried the first alerts the smoke detectors that have died

901
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,704
Marinade

902
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,544
Pretty sure they're working on it I can see you after I said Google Assistant as well

903
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:57,920
Yes so the First Alert smoke detectors they're expensive they're like $200

904
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,200
Is there a smoke detector

905
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,272
It sounds really good it actually has an amazing speaker in there

906
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,832
And they mount to your ceiling

907
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,112
Exactly where

908
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Your old smoke detector

909
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
Here's my issue

910
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,512
If you want just to talk to her and you don't want it to play music

911
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:18,400
This is a good option but a lot of the devices like I've had met him inside light switches

912
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,472
Thermostat with Madam inside

913
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,800
It's weird the placement is not ideal for a lot of pee

914
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
Bee stings for like listening

915
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,592
Music

916
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,872
My thermostats are

917
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,920
Come to the back of a hallway

918
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,712
Even your smoke detectors are in a

919
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
Weird spot

920
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Ring sometime

921
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,552
They're not in the middle of the sea

922
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,624
Not going to be full Fidelity sound there

923
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,696
If you're just wanting to talk to it then yes it is

924
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,976
It's totally fine but

925
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,792
Sometimes it's a little weird having your light switch play music

926
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,816
Your mileage may vary

927
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:50,400
He may not care about sound quality maybe like this is totally sufficient

928
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,680
Get rid of stuff on my

929
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,704
Chosen

930
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,240
Places it's all out there for

931
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,568
The one caveat I will say with a lot of these devices

932
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,152
You want to check to see which Amazon services are

933
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:05,504
Example the First Alert does not support the newest amazon echo

934
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:11,136
That's kind of common with third-party implementations of these voice services

935
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,952
Now that's typically the newest features come to

936
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,560
Name brand eat the ones made by Amazon her by Google Etc

937
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,400
Eventually a lot of them filter down to third parties but not always

938
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,216
Yeah like some of the smart light switches and I think my

939
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,984
Ecobee

940
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,032
Thermostat doesn't play me

941
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
Right

942
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,592
Timothy

943
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
Vector

944
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,992
Which does have met him a built-in that you can get one pretty cheap since the company is

945
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:42,880
Perfect for turning lights on or asking the weather isn't such but I wouldn't play music

946
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,672
Actually

947
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,976
Which is a shame cuz you know DJ Roomba

948
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,536
He does dance if you're asking

949
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
All right

950
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,632
I feel like we're moving off now that we're talking about

951
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
What robots can do

952
00:36:54,912 --> 00:37:01,056
Let's call it quits for this segment of the show I'd love for you to stay tuned because I have Elizabeth haakenson

This is a

955
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,944
25 billion Euro company

She's talking about their steps to do a digital transformation The itot Divide

957
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
Ian

958
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,904
So there's a lot of meat to this

959
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,440
Please stay tuned for that

960
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:22,048
And in the meantime here's a message from our sponsor

961
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:28,448
Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor

962
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,752
Where is Dell Technologies and I have

963
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
Hendel's

964
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,872
The general manager of Dell Technologies industry iot

965
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,408
Iot safety answer

966
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
Security

967
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
And computer vision

968
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
10

969
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,016
That is a lot of titles

970
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,064
So what is your business exactly

971
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,928
Excited to be here and sponsor this second

972
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,976
First people on the podcast probably know that

973
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,536
Surveillance cameras

974
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,144
For over 20 years

975
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,960
Don't be a sensor to become much more intelligent

976
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,264
Much more capable are driving a lot

977
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,592
This is requiring a customer

978
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
Look at 6

979
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,664
Security in a very new paradigm

980
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,992
Insecurities

981
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,552
And also wanted to integrate this video

982
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,576
Iot data

983
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,136
They wanted to apply analytics to make better decisions

984
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
This is happening

985
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,976
All about customer service

986
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
Oliver cast

987
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
It's a real challenge that we have right now

988
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,960
A few months ago Dell Technologies lunch the Dell Technologies iot solution for surveillance

989
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,032
He told me that this solution can handle

990
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,824
Some enormous use cases

991
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,920
I believe you got one customer with over 250000 cameras

992
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,712
And another who is dealing with

993
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
100 in

994
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
20 petabytes

995
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,528
A video store

996
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,576
That is an enormous amount of

997
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,112
Cameras and data

998
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,416
How has the solution changed

999
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,952
From the time that you've launched

1000
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,512
We started with those complex cost

1001
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,792
Bat size range

1002
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,608
Challenges

1003
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,424
Density of cameras and not quantity

1004
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,264
Storage want to stop there

1005
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,312
Downtobuck smaller system

1006
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,128
What customers still have complexities and deployment

1007
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:16,480
Envoy management life cycle management of all that begins

1008
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,504
10 days.

1009
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,272
Just 30 days

1010
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Years

1011
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,928
Make it easier more scalable

1012
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,488
Technology and Storage

1013
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
That's what all right

1014
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,304
Who would benefit most

1015
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
From this type of

1016
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,912
What great things about today

1017
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,936
Security data

1018
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,216
That affects everybody

1019
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,008
It doesn't matter if your hospital

1020
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,544
School stadium

1021
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
Assateague

1022
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
Enterprise customer

Frances oldest technologies that is a quart

1024
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,992
Address problems

1025
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,040
Regardless of the customer type

1026
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:54,368
But really where customers need a very supportable

1027
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,136
Scalable

1028
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,464
Secure solution to the boy named it surveillance at scale

1029
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,512
Great so can wear kinfolks

1030
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,328
Let's go to learn more about Dell Technologies

1031
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,888

I am fantastic

1041
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,472
So let's start with Schneider Electric

1042
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,752
Tell us a little bit

1043
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
About

1044
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
Because it is

1045
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,080
It is huge

1046
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,872
It does a lot of different things

1047
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:48,896
How should we do

1048
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,736
Electric is a global company

1049
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:58,112
And we're leading the digital transformation of energy management and automation

1050
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
Across

1051
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
Multiple Market

1052
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,720
Which include industry powerbuilding

1053
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,280
Stata Center in other infrastructure

1054
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,048
Projects

1055
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,072
We have

1056
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,888
Over a hundred thirty thousand employees

1057
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,912
In more than

1058
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,192
100 countries

1059
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,008
We had 25.7

1060
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,336
Billion Euro in Revenue in 2018

1061
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,384
And we spend about five

1062
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,944
Percent of our Revenue devoted

1063
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,968
To R&D

1064
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:29,088
All right and what I want my audience to understand is Schneider Electric is kind of the original

1065
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,112
OT type

1066
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:30,880
Accompanied

1067
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,416
This is a company that makes

1068
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:37,792
Circuit breaker should make building management software these are people who are dealing with

1069
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
Gott's

1070
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,352
A buildings and

1071
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,144
They don't necessarily take kindly

1072
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
Thai tea

1073
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
So that's why you're on this week

1074
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,264
And I wanted to ask you first

1075
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,056
How do you view your role

1076
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
Is a CIO

1077
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,895
When we're in the midst of this big digital transfer

1078
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:59,295
Ayo for quite some time now I would say it's probably one of the most

1079
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
Exciting times

1080
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,111
To be a CIA

1081
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:08,511
Even the digital transformation because it doesn't matter what industry that you are in

1082
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:12,863
Your customers are what countries are located in we're all experienced

1083
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,655
And seeing the benefits

1084
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:21,055
Digital Technologies in so as CIO it's really important to get

1085
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:25,919
Close to your customers and your business peers and determine how best

1086
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
We go on

1087
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,967
Digital Journey

1088
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:33,343
Together and depending upon the company or with some cios are actually the one

1089
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
Leading

1090
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,391
The company

1091
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:38,463
Digital efforts and then there's like Schneider

1092
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,863
It was so big and we have so much going on with digital that two years ago the company

1093
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,447
Decided to create a new rule called the chief digital officer

1094
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,007
And Reporting into that role

1095
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,543
Are folks like me

1096
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:57,407
Myself she is the chief data officer

1097
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Other

1098
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,735
Levels at the at the sea level

1099
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,783
Who are also focusing on

1100
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,319
Customer experience

1101
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,367
Car services experience

1102
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
So we're really a

1103
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,671
Collection

1104
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,463
Individual

1105
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,791
To have deep experience and everything

1106
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,863
From marketing service R&D

1107
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,935
It security all coming together

1108
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:23,007
Under the chief digital officer

1109
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,031
Umbrella

1110
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,847
To help lead the digital transformation

1111
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
The company

1112
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:34,015
Other companies do it could be very different from that in and asking either a CTO or

1113
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
Ciot

1114
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:41,439
Digital transformation but here we have a much broader scope of individuals working together to drive the tree

1115
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,207
Information

1116
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:46,047
That's why it's with a hundred thirty thousand people I can't imagine trying to

1117
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,351
Change the course of that ship so

1118
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,143
Makes a lot of sense

1119
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:56,799
So in the role of CIO I'm really curious because we talked a lot about in these digital transformations

1120
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,871
There's an itot divide and that's the

1121
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,895
IT staff

1122
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,687
An operational staff

1123
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,759
You talked about it as a convergence which I think is totally Act

1124
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:12,159
Can you talk a little bit about how that is working inside Schneider Electric as you guys undergo this digital

1125
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
Transformation

1126
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:17,791
As you mentioned we believe I can OT is about a convergent

1127
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:22,399
And not a divided although it may be some who continue think that way

1128
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,471
When cyber security started to become

1129
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,031
More and more of a concern

1130
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,103
Accompanies we realize that as we began

1131
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,223
Take these traditional OT devices that didn't connect

1132
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,807
2 to the internet and now do connect to the internet that's with B

1133
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,879
Acronym of all your tears we realize that

1134
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,671
There was no longer

1135
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,951
The separation

1136
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:51,839
Between OT and it they now we're going to begin to be on the same network communicate

1137
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
Did together

1138
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,655
Different types of

1139
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:59,775
Systems that might be in factories excetera so it's blinking really be Enterprise

1140
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,871
Systems to the systems that were contained in the past

1141
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,431
But saying factories for example

1142
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,967
So which is Convergence

1143
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,759
We found that

1144
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:16,927
More started to come into the IT realm or even to the CIO because

1145
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,975
Many of our colleagues

1146
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,279
Let's say here in plants and factories

1147
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:26,911
Dismiss early pay a lot of attention to systems in the past most of what they use for self

1148
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:33,311
Contained and all of a sudden they have their systems being exposed to the internet which means that they are now.

1149
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,639
Vulnerable potentially for a Cyber attack

1150
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,967
So I would say that the it organization and

1151
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,295
Has been managing

1152
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,831
Cyber-security for

1153
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,391
Hazard enterprise system

1154
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:53,791
I've been on the internet for you know at least a decade is not war we were very knowledgeable and aware

1155
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,071
Of the different

1156
00:45:55,327 --> 00:46:01,471
Security practices that you would need only from access control but also different uses of software

1157
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,263
To protect from cyber-attacks

1158
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,055
So this convergence

1159
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
For us

1160
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,591
Schneider

1161
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,127
Probably easier

1162
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,919
Then maybe others

1163
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,199
Just you two are

1164
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
Extensive

1165
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:17,855
It footprint not only in our offices but also within our plants in our factories

1166
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:23,743
And I'm curious because when I go and visit plants and factories and I talked to them about security

1167
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:27,327
I feel like a lot of these operationally focused individuals

1168
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
They have

1169
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,143
Wonderful training

1170
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:36,287
And they have things like OSHA rules are ISO rules that they have to follow for security and safety

1171
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,823
And I look at that and I think

1172
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:44,479
Hey a lot of times that's sort of training and probably documentation would be actually really X

1173
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,551
Excellent in the IT world and we don't have things like that

1174
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,367
Go out maybe to all of the employees for example

1175
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:56,767
And I'm curious maybe what are the best practices each side could take from each other to improve security

1176
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,839
I would say that it's a partnership

1177
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,119
Speak about

1178
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:07,519
Our company because that's the one I'm I'm closest to on the subject in the gentleman who leads our

1179
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
Supply chain

1180
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,359
His team and I would say the chief

1181
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,639
Digital officer

1182
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,407
Teams

1183
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:16,735
We are very tightly coupled as well as our chief

1184
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
Information

1185
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,039
Security officer so

1186
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,367
We look at the group's working hand-in-hand

1187
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:30,559
So while we certainly will I Upon Our plants in our distribution center

1188
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:34,399
To implement the nist standards and framework

1189
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:38,495
For cyber-security you know obviously we're always willing

1190
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
To learn

1191
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,799
And in fact

1192
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,847
The way we look at protecting our FAQ

1193
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:47,455
Factories in our distribution centers is with an individual from the global

1194
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,759
Who is coming from

1195
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,551
More of the safety background

1196
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,575
In the plant

1197
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,623
And we're we're merging

1198
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,927
Viewpoint the best of both

1199
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:02,047
Operational best practices as well as it in cyber best

1200
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,351
And I do believe that

1201
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,935
The pace at which we are moving and implementing

1202
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,703
Our plans

1203
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
Is phenomenal

1204
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:16,895
I know I talked to a lot of other cio2 Vikings are still trying to figure out maybe the the division

1205
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:22,271
Between the organizations and what we decided to do and I think it was just part of

1206
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
The wave

1207
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:28,927
Some of the leaders are we took down all the higher keys and and the different lines between us

1208
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:34,815
And we realized that we were better working together than as a as a divide

1209
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:38,911
And being open to any of the best practices that we could bring to the table

1210
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,191
Excellent

1211
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,495
And another challenge on this side

1212
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,263
What is that

1213
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
It

1214
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
Typically has

1215
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,127
You know you think of things like a child which is a very big

1216
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,967
Development process that everyone's espousing and you think of things like

1217
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,759
Hey if your plant manager

1218
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,855
You don't want to change everything you just want something that works and you want to stick with it

1219
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:03,231
Hopefully it doesn't break right so it feels like these are very different worldviews that have evolved for

1220
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:09,887
Really good reasons how do you build compromise how do you take from each world how do those things work in practice it

1221
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:13,727
Because I know that you know I've got cio's of hospitals were like

1222
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,031
Don't know how I talk to these people

1223
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:21,663
This is a big challenge people don't know where things are and you don't talk to cios in other Industries and they're just

1224
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,455
Are flummoxed they don't know how

1225
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,479
How to do this

1226
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,551
What I would say that one needs to start with

1227
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,343
Maybe

1228
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,367
The internet

1229
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,671
The iot products

1230
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,207
Because

1231
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:38,559
We have to be talking to someone in our company would be

1232
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:43,935
The head of the plan for the distribution center and Hospital you know it would probably be the facilities group

1233
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,519
They are getting very excited about these internet

1234
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:51,359
Things because it's allowing them to better manage

1235
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,407
Are acid they can

1236
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:59,807
And get real-time visibility and insight into the connected assets they can look at energy efficient

1237
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,343
Be more readily

1238
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,903
As we get excited about implement

1239
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:09,535
These new capabilities in the conversation that has to happen about

1240
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,303
Safety

1241
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,607
Around this because in many cases

1242
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:15,935
Again the information is being stored on

1243
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:19,775
Cloud so there is an internet connection and even though

1244
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:24,383
You were and maybe the data encrypted on the way up and down

1245
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,175
You're still vulnerable

1246
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,735
Tubitv a cybersecurity attack

1247
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,271
So you have to

1248
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,831
Talk to each other in terms that you want

1249
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,671
Not talking in fiber Buzz language

1250
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,207
And it's talking about

1251
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,487
What are the risk

1252
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
What are the mitigation Settlers Ridge

1253
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,071
How do we work together

1254
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,631
And again listening to each other because I

1255
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:52,031
I feel what happens is that sometimes you put the wrong people in front of each other we take the technical

1256
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:58,431
Cheap person or the heavy technical cyber person and we're putting them in front of

1257
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:02,527
Maybe an individual who knows how to run their plant or Hospital

1258
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,343
But he's not as familiar with what

1259
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,111
A cloud

1260
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,927
What do you mean my information is being stored somewhere else

1261
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,719
So I really think it's about

1262
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,255
Listening to each other

1263
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,559
And making sure that you're using the most

1264
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,351
Basic terms in Landen

1265
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:23,263
Because this is so very new to a lot of people and I think the first thing we do is just not her headache

1266
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
Each other

1267
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,335
You don't think okay that I don't know what that person

1268
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:32,735
Nothing but I believe them and I I just moved over with my job instead of really taking the time to say I don't

1269
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:37,343
Understand what that means I don't understand the risk how does this work and really be able to talk

1270
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,391
People at their level

1271
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,439
And using language that sings Aaliyah

1272
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
I like it

1273
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,279
I think that's always a good idea

1274
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:51,935
So you actually are doing something with this at Schneider Electric you guys not only have launched

1275
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,239
A product called ether structure which is

1276
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,799
Organize building management infrastructure

1277
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
But

1278
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:02,431
You guys are implementing this in your own facilities so can you tell us a little bit about ecostruxure

1279
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,735
And what you're doing with that

1280
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:08,575
So we can structure fits nicely into what we call our

1281
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,111
Factory program

1282
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:15,743
So we use the our ecostruxure iot Technologies in our manufacturing plant

1283
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:16,767
Facilities

1284
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:20,095
And even many of our offices as we would offer it

1285
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:20,863
To our custom

1286
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:27,519
Start everything from building Energy Management to Internet of Things

1287
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,543
Operators

1288
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:33,919
We actually showcase these to our customers and we've done this in France

1289
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,943
India

1290
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,991
In China we implemented

1291
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:43,391
A couple of our products Under the ecostruxure Umbrella one was augmented operator advisor and

1292
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,415
Enables

1293
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,695
Are operators

1294
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:49,791
To use augmented reality to speed up an operation and maintenance

1295
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:53,887
And we've been delivering between 2 and 7%

1296
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,167
Guinea productivity

1297
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,775
We also have implemented our ecostruxure resource advisor

1298
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,615
Which delivers up to 30% Energy savings

1299
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,151
And contribute

1300
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,967
Two continuous Improvement throughout the years

1301
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,015
So those are just two examples of us

1302
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:14,111
Showcasing to our customers ecostruxure iot

1303
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,903
Products that we are

1304
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
Using ourselves

1305
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,463
And sharing

1306
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,511
Obviously the productivity gains

1307
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,791
And where the energy

1308
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
Keysavings

1309
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,607
And we plan to implement

1310
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:27,167
These products and services in

1311
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,703
Our Industrial

1312
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,751
Footprint which today includes

1313
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,543
Over 200 factories

1314
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,823
8 / 44

1315
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,383
Countries that we are Representatives

1316
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,991
As part of this implementation how involved do you get

1317
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:47,391
And what is your role is the CIO in trying to roll this ecostruxure platform out to more and more

1318
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,927
Plants or building

1319
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:53,535
The first thing we need to do is make sure that the connectivity

1320
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:58,399
Is available in the planter the Distribution Center so that traditionally

1321
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,447
Those clients have not been opened up

1322
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:04,031
To the Internet so we have to make sure one that they have the right level of

1323
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:09,919
Connectivity and bandwidth to this is all wireless connected so we have to make sure there's enough

1324
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,479
Points within the facilities

1325
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:15,807
To ensure that the Internet of Things devices

1326
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:19,647
Can actually communicate and if I talkin to cio's out there

1327
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:22,719
I would say this is probably the biggest learning

1328
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:25,023
Is one having enough bandwidth

1329
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,583
Ain't you making sure that there are enough taxes

1330
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,607
Points because

1331
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:35,263
Access twins get congested very very quickly even within being 20 to 25 feet apart

1332
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,079
So that's a big learning how do we make sure that we have all the

1333
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,359
Connectivity in place

1334
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:42,431
Then it's really ensuring that

1335
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,479
We can protect

1336
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:50,879
The assets that are in that facility from a cyber perspective so it's putting in different types of

1337
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,159
Software

1338
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,439
One two names

1339
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:56,511
Is Clarity which allows us to discover assets

1340
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,279
In

1341
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,839
The plant or the Distribution Center

1342
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,887
And alert us if something new

1343
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:05,727
Is identify we put in all of our best practices around

1344
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,543
Certain pieces of equipment

1345
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:12,383
And then of course we're layering different authentication layers as to who

1346
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:15,455
Maintain these systems and maybe upgrade them

1347
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,503
So aside from ensuring

1348
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:23,903
Add all of these pieces of equipment can actually communicate to each other then we move into ensuring that there is proper

1349
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,695
Security around the environment

1350
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:26,975
Got it

1351
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:31,839
Real fast on the security front because I think this is something that's really important

1352
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,607
Drive-In

1353
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,631
Which is

1354
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,167
An IT side

1355
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,191
I see a lot of

1356
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,727
People emphasizing

1357
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,287
Two different types of security one is Network

1358
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:43,359
Apus security so monitoring device traffic on your network

1359
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,919
Sample and saying hey this is behaving weird

1360
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,199
And then to

1361
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:53,599
Is are things like Microsoft Azure sphere is one it's this device base security

1362
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,647
It also does a handshake

1363
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:58,207
To the cloud it's usually key based

1364
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,767
So Microsoft has something arm PSA

1365
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,815
Is a way to implement this as well

1366
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,119
Those two things seem very complimentary

1367
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,399
But

1368
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:12,799
I'm curious if that's enough for the OT World which historically hasn't been as security

1369
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,079
Focused because

1370
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,615
It hasn't been on the internet

1371
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,687
Or are you seeing other

1372
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,247
Types of security related to

1373
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,783
The address to physical

1374
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:27,647
That's what we're seeing very targeted companies

1375
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,415
Focused on

1376
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,695
Unsecured eGo-T

1377
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,231
So the first thing that we

1378
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,767
We need to do is make sure that weird

1379
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,535
Discovering

1380
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,815
All of the assets

1381
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,839
That are

1382
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,863
Within the plant

1383
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,679
Or the distribution center in so we are using

1384
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,215
Suffer from a company

1385
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,239
Cold clarity

1386
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,263
So that's helping us

1387
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,823
Identify things that maybe we didn't know

1388
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,615
Run the network but then we also have

1389
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,407
Have to figure out once we identify some

1390
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,455
That is new what do we do with it

1391
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,991
Containerize it

1392
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,527
Is it actually a thread

1393
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,343
Is it just a new piece of equipment that

1394
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,135
Came onto the scene that we

1395
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,415
Might not have known about

1396
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,951
So those types of

1397
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,231
Technologies

1398
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
AR

1399
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,047
And

1400
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,583
I would say that at this

1401
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,351
Point

1402
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,679
The best approaches multi-layered which is

1403
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,727
What I believe we're doing from

1404
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,031
The network perspective shows

1405
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,055
Securing

1406
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:17,823
And

1407
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,847
Segmenting

1408
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,943
Let's say the factories the distribution centers the hospital

1409
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:25,247
And then having a discovery layer

1410
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:28,063
On top of that then having policies

1411
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:32,671
That can help us determine if we identify a new acid should it be there

1412
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:36,767
And then we're also beginning to test software

1413
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:37,791
On

1414
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,071
Behavioral Analytics

1415
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,863
So there is

1416
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,191
A lot of data that can be captured

1417
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,751
And we can look for Behavior pattern

1418
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:49,567
But I think we're going to continue to see the advancement

1419
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,847
A multi-layered

1420
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,615
Security

1421
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,895
Not

1422
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:57,759
Very similar to what we already have been building for decades in the traditional it sent

1423
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,039
Excellent

1424
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:01,343
All right will Elizabeth this is been really

1425
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,367
Helpful

1426
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:06,207
I feel smarter about the OT it convergence I feel

1427
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,023
Less terrified about cyber-physical security

1428
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:15,679
And I appreciate you coming on the show this week thank you so much that's it for this week

1429
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:22,079
Thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot news sign up for my newsletter at today

1430
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:26,175
Stacey on iot. Cam will see you next week
