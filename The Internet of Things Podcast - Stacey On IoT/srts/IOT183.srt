And welcome all we're going to be talking about Amazon Amazon Amazon so much Amazon based on all the news

7
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,112
It was out last week

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,000
Microsoft ignite is happening so we can be talking about some updates with Microsoft including Cortana and

9
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:32,768
Azure

10
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,536
Plus

11
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,864
We got a new whiting's watch we're going to see if Kevin wants it

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,632
Plus

13
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,936
Dulux a new sprinkler and

14
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,704
Maybe

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,520
A quick update on my brilliant lights

16
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:47,104
Plus this week we've got a guest Rayford Smith of

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,872
Entergy

18
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,432
Do I talk to at the SAS Analytics

19
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
Summit

20
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,528
We're going to talk about all about how to manage a digital transformation

21
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:00,928
And speaking of SAS they are a sponsor of this week's podcast although I did pay my own way for the summer

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,256
So all of that and more awaits you

23
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,280
But first

24
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,328
Let's get a message from our sponsor

25
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,728
This week sponsor is aqua keep your iot Fleet growing and trade in the days of remoting into your car

Customers devices to identify and resolve bugs upgrade to Aqua 10 minutes unless it's Edge verse

27
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:26,528
Problem solving software do the heavy lifting for you chocolate automatically finds performance issues and then tracks

28
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,928
Stem from released release collecting all the Intel you need to rapidly identify root causes for the errors play

Waking you and your customers register for free today chocolate. IO that's a you

30
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
K letv

Dot IO

32
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,448
Okay Kevin last week

33
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,496
I was at the Amazon announcement

34
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,848
Which word actually 70 pieces of news released in about an hour and a half

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
Was like getting shot in the head with

36
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,944
It's about a hundred water balloons was very exciting

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
And we're going to cover all 70 in-depth today

38
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
What is with Amazon in their timing they know we do this podcast so certain day the weekend yet they had their event right

39
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,976
After we did our podcast

40
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,560
I know I can't believe they're not appreciating us

41
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Subscribers list

42
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,680
It's on our calendars Amazon you can see it

43
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,240
School on them okay so

44
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,288
We've already written a couple things about it

45
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,968
So if you want to discover the 11:00 new Echo devices from clocks to microwaves

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
All kinds of crazy stuff

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
That's on the website

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
I also talked about the strategy

49
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,624
There's a couple things we didn't cover

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,768
In that news that we can talk about and there's actually a couple questions that you guys sent to us the first one

51
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,608
And will cover this at the very end so stay tuned for that but that is

52
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
Based on all of this news

53
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,984
Would we go to being a straight Google or straight Amazon

54
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
Does this mean that

55
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,824
What should somebody

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
So

57
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
You got in mind as we talked about some

58
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
Pictures so

59
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
In addition to all of these devices

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
Amazon

61
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
A really cool thing

62
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,112
Is basically now turned all of your echos

63
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
An echo Dot

64
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
Security alarm

65
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,536
Watch the service called guard and this is something

66
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,584
You can say is you're walking out of the house

67
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,144
And it will

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,936
All of your echos turn into

69
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:25,824
Glass break sensors so they're listening for the sound of glass breaking the sound

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,896
Smoke detectors or carbon monoxide alarms going

71
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,224
And if they hear these I'll actually send you a notice

72
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
Vacation

73
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,856
If it's monitored security you can actually send it to your monitored security system

74
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
Intel

75
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
Do whatever they do

76
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,440
I thought this was really cool

77
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
Waste not just cool it's brilliant

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,144
Because it doesn't require people to buy any new hardware basically the microphones are all

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
Very very good in the

80
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
Echo products

81
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,520
And noticed repurposing them for a very useful service

82
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
Yeah and it's free so

83
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,944
Is that now in addition to your wake word

84
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,272
That you have selected Amazon is going to always be listening

85
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,088
For glass breaking and the sound of your smoke alarm

86
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,672
So in some ways they're using security as a way to

87
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
Encroach on privacy

88
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
Look at that way which some people will

89
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,351
I don't necessarily think so they're always listening anyway

90
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
Well yes but now you've got

91
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
A greater number of triggers that will

92
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Trigger something happen

93
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
And take an action in store that

94
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
Snip it to the cloud

95
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,383
If that's fine they want to listen to the sound of breaking glass all day that's

96
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
I need the it is a valuable service

97
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,223
Your privacy

98
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
Skytran if you're discussing a murder

99
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
Baby don't break glass

100
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439
They just in Corgi

101
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,047
Funny hangout let me add that to my rules of when I'm discussing these things

102
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,839
Tuck near broken flask

103
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,399
Got it or if you are in the midst of murdering

104
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
TriNet

105
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,775
Could you step away from the window for psych thank you okay

106
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
So

107
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
The other thing to think about here is

108
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
They're adding a lot of

109
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,223
Intelligence at the edge so now

110
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,319
I talked to their

111
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
When you're always listening this is happy

112
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391
This doesn't get sent to the

113
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,463
Alright so now they've got three compressed model sitting at

114
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
The edge

115
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,767
What's the Wake word one for class 1

116
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,863
Smoke detection you know if you're in the AI world or the edge processor

117
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
That's kind of an interesting

118
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
And also

119
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
Also speaking of the edge

120
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
Amazon announced

121
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
Local support

122
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
4 commands at this event

123
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
Animalistic

124
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,967
Don't know when it is coming they said in a cup

125
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
Who knows

126
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
But

127
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
This is. This means if your

128
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
Internet goes out

129
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:51,231
You could actually still say things like turn on the lights and the lights will go out

130
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,095
This was a huge reason I've actually done with Wink in the past

131
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,703
I don't want to see the first but they were among the first to have localized commands in a hub

132
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,751
So that was key for me

133
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:09,151
Not that we losing a lot

134
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,199
Take a trip over themselves if they had to use them

135
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
I'm pretty sure they

136
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
In the dark I don't know

137
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
I thought that was

138
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
Really noteworthy

139
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
I got two questions though

140
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,303
What about the guard service not a question why should I comment

141
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,655
Did I understand correctly you're also going to automate your smart lights when you're not at home

142
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,447
Yes they are so you

143
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,775
You can actually set that up so when you turn on guard it will automate

144
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Your smart lights

145
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
Which by the way is a fee

146
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
Feature that I had with

147
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Nasty

148
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
15

149
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
But it didn't work super well

150
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,343
And I think wink also offers this feature as part of their hubs

151
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
An automation

152
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
Controls your lights when

153
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
But

154
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,999
This is still super awesome.

155
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
Because a lot of people don't have a

156
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
Exactly the other thing

157
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:06,239
You're talking about the machine learning models now they've got a couple of them now in these devices

158
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
And this is just a general question as

159
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
We seem more

160
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,663
AI machine learning push to Edge devices in the homes

161
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Wilda

162
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:21,087
Current Hardware be able to keep up I mean I'm thinking about it from a memory standpoint from a CPU standpoint Sonora

163
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:25,183
As our devices get more complex through these algorithmic learning models

164
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
We actually need to upgrade in a couple years

165
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
I think we probably will

166
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,095
If I took one thing away from this event is

167
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,935
You know your four-year-old at those they actually are getting a lot of

168
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,519
The big difference right now is that

169
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,311
Speakers sound better in the

170
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,175
I'm wondering if maybe we'll get this product iteration and then we'll get

171
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
The next one is when

172
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,039
Can you swap so maybe we're looking at a smart speaker lifespan of me

173
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
It yours

174
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
With enough

175
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
Overhead in memory for these

176
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Things I don't know

177
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,791
Considering the prices at the thing that's not crazy I would agree and also you won't have to upgrade you just maybe

178
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,839
Some of the newest features

179
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,703
What was really interesting is how they talked about

180
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,751
What they did on the AI back into shrink

181
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
These models

182
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
It's not

183
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Worth diving into here

184
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,663
They have given a lot of thought

185
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
I'm trying to make sure every

186
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,039
Is close to the edge as possible so you get lots for Stuff

187
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,599
The other thing they have and we didn't talk about this

188
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
Is whisper mode

189
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,183
So I love it

190
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,767
If you whisper to your Echo

191
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
In the coming weeks

192
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
Eco Whisper back

193
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,703
Because you're whispering

194
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:46,591
I love love love this because I never said this on multiple servers I stay up late everybody to sleep

195
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,991
And when I leave my room my office I will tell one of my assistants shut the light and whoever assistant it is whichever is

196
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
It's really loud

197
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
Super

198
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,903
Google has actually something similar with the Google home

199
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
You have

200
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
You can turn it on

201
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
In the Google home app

202
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Under devices

203
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
You can do a setting called night mode

204
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
And then

205
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,399
You choose it from one time to another time

206
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,447
And when you have that

207
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,519
Mute notifications in any boot up sound switch

208
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
I don't know if the powers ever gone out

209
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
Overnight with your Amazon Echo

210
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
She comes and she's like

211
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Hello

212
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,479
Searching for Wi-Fi at everyone said what what just happened

213
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,039
Burglar in the house searching for Wi-Fi

214
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
Exactly

215
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
So it didn't your LED lights

216
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
And it

217
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,279
So those are all really nice things

218
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,863
This is a little more intuitive because it just automatically does it when

219
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,679
Can you whisper as opposed to having to set a setting

220
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,239
But just so you know if you're in the Google verse

221
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
This is still

222
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
Something that you

223
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
So

224
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
That was

225
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
The Amazon stock

226
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
Was so exciting because they

227
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247
Came out with not just a bunch of devices

228
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,551
But actually an entire way of

229
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
Thinking about the Smart Home

230
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,159
Ecosystem that gets us closer to this contextual

231
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,231
Easy world that Kevin and I think we should already be in

232
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
So they announced

233
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,327
Some things to make it easier to set up Wi-Fi

234
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
They talked about creating

235
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
Module called

236
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
Mute your Echoes for this

237
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
The Alexa

238
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
Connecticut which is a development

239
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,103
Ford

240
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
Bluetooth and WiFi module

241
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,503
That connects to Amazon

242
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
What's interesting there

243
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Is that you

244
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
You can actually buy that

245
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Ian

246
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
Your cost will be covered

247
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
Without initial fee for that module

248
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
I just made all your clothes

249
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,839
A bird like you're going to send it video that's probably not going to

250
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
Before a lot of like sensors or one-off devices this is a great thing cuz you no longer have to worry about

251
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,055
He's crazy cost every single year with the

252
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
Set device

253
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
It solves a lot of the business

254
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,735
Problems and what that's going to like even more if you can imagine

255
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,039
More matinee devices

256
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Yes

257
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
So this is great

258
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,159
The Amazon ecosystem

259
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,463
Devices

260
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
Especially since their support for sensors

261
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
So they're really pushing

262
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
Forward with

263
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,423
A vision for the smart home and I said this before and I'll say it again that really rivals

264
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
Apple did with the smart

265
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,287
I just came out of this feeling like God

266
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Apple

267
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:30,175
What are you doing man this is the sort of thing that you guys used to be so good at

268
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
In

269
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
Amazon's really doing so

270
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:40,415
It gets back to something you said a show or two ago that pretty much they're setting the standard and I just mean the standard for

271
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,463
The products but standards

272
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
For how these products work

273
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
Yes

274
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
And it's going to be awesome

275
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
So

276
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
Knowing all of this

277
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:54,495
More devices cheaper devices Whimsical devices like $60 microwave for $30

278
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
Would I

279
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Invest still

280
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Ecosystem

281
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
So

282
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
That was the question

283
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
That someone

284
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
Is it good question

285
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
I am all in on the Google ecosystem for my

286
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
Web services soap

287
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
Email and all that even

288
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
You know sometimes it's

289
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
Came to get my

290
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Google Apps account

291
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
To do anything with me

292
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,815
I think I'm going to connect all of my devices

293
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Tomato mayonnaise

294
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
For the time being

295
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
I'd Focus there for the smart

296
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,447
Hamster but I probably key

297
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
Cheap T I have the Lenovo smart display finally

298
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,567
I would keep one of those in my house

299
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
As a way to Lake

300
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
Interact with my

301
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
I guess my professional Inc

302
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
Computer-based life

303
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
If that makes sense

304
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
And just have Amazon

305
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
Show me my smart home base life

306
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,367
That makes sense that makes sense 710 G7

307
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,927
Siri in my life 503

308
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
And it's

309
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,303
It's confusing as all get-out to be talking at three different things in the same room for one thing but it's

310
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,351
This is what we do and there's a reason we do it

311
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,423
I don't think I would commit to any one of them just because of what I

312
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,007
Here with you and so on but if I had to

313
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,567
I'm probably would be leaning to go back

314
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,871
To Madame a

315
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
Because I just

316
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,247
The Integrations are into so many more types of products

317
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
Yeso

318
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
Speaking of Integrations this is a big one

319
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
The smart

320
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,671
Home skills API

321
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,487
They update

322
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,815
Play the updated in a way that makes me feel like they are coming after

323
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
Device

324
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
Data schema

325
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
We talked about a lot of show

326
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
And that's basically

327
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,263
A universal way for device to say hey this is what I am

328
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
This is what I meant

329
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,871
Right now we don't have that we have company

330
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
Ocf

331
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
Create standards around this

332
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,783
And what we have with Amazon is this smart home skills API

333
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
Set allows for

334
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Three different settings

335
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,671
So it has a toggle setting that turns things on or off

336
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:54,047
Has a range of options that let you set a range that could be a temperature it could be

337
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,095
Oven thermostat temperature

338
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
Sound

339
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Sound

340
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
It has a range

341
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,031
It has a mode option that lets a device maker program a

342
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Text function

343
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,847
So this is where you're going to get like in an oven

344
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
Is a baker is it real

345
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
In a washing machine

346
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
Permanent press

347
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Cotton

348
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Owls

349
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
Those kind of specific

350
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
And

351
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,879
That actually covers quite a wide range

352
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,927
Things that devices can do

353
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,279
And it's going to be really powerful for developers to have this be

354
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
Because

355
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
Then you can

356
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
Basic reading skill

357
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
Easily

358
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,215
And then they also talked about

359
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
Natural invocation

360
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
And this is very powerful

361
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
As well

362
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,151
This is where you're going to be able to ask Madame just do some

363
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
Turn on the vacuum

364
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
And it's going to understand what the back

365
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Team is based on patterns of

366
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
Usage that it seemed

367
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
Mystify senior

368
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,671
So this is some of this where it's always going to be learning based on your information

369
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
Formation that's happening in your specific home

370
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,279
And it's going to be tied back to that hoe

371
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,607
It's smart contacts its Blossom once we get there

372
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
Yeah so

373
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
Very exciting stuff

374
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
And now

375
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,239
We talked a lot about it

376
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
How to cut a donut hole show on

377
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,591
Zip through to another seattle-based company

378
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Microsoft

379
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Because they

380
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
Are doing their big event

381
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
This week Microsoft

382
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,087
And they have shown off actually things for Cortana that make it seem like

383
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,647
It's just like Amazon's doing the Smart Home

384
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Cortana

385
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,279
And then a lot of industrial support for things like digital twin

386
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
Let's talk about how Microsoft is

387
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
Making Cortana

388
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
I don't know

389
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:45,663
Turn up from a Halo from Halo perspective which is where they got the name Cortana school but other than that I'm not really

390
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
Jazz

391
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,527
But then again I don't work in an Enterprise anymore if I still did

392
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,391
Sure I'd be super psyched over this you know show me our sales figures for last month or even

393
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,791
You know what's the trend of help desk calls over the last six months and Y or whatever what's the big mean root cause

394
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,631
It's just another user interface didn't get it Analytics

395
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,215
Yes and it's called Cortana skills for Enterprise

396
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,775
And this is the first major update to

397
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,823
Improve the way Cortana works

398
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
Web Developers

399
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
So

400
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Really exciting

401
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
And

402
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
We'll see how this

403
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
Works out

404
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:27,135
Is a proof-of-concept Microsoft did an IT Help Desk kill for Cortana to help people file tickets

405
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Which

406
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,207
Back in the day when I was in a large cup

407
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,255
Pain in the butt so

408
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
Jay

409
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
Is it also this will tie into

410
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
Microsoft

411
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
But they should have to build

412
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,215
Earlier this year where they had like the super intelligent

413
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
Cortana powered conference room

414
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
Maps physical spaces

415
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
Recognize people

416
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
Tok notes for you

417
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Ridiculous

418
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
Microsoft at

419
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
Ignite did talk about

420
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
Rodney gets aif

421
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
They also

422
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,879
On the industrial iot side

423
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,183
Agri services

424
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
So

425
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
Azure data box

426
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
Set of products

427
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
That's going to

428
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Enable

429
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
Russian restaurant

430
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
Brunetti's which is an orchestration

431
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
Orchestrate

432
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,287
Services that run at the edge

433
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
And the cloud

434
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,591
So they're going to

435
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
Bring two birdies

436
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
As well

437
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
They're going to

438
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Update

439
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,015
Windows server

440
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,343
And it's going to support some Azure services this is a big

441
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,903
There are some

442
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,719
Devices out there running Windows server

443
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
Need to be able to talk

444
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,143
Computing model with gateways and sensors and

445
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
Clouds at all

446
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
Talk to each other

447
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
Microsoft

448
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
Is adding

449
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
Digital twins

450
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,247
One of the brand new cloud services that Microsoft is going

451
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Offer

452
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,319
On Asher in this is a big deal

453
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
Because

454
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
The industrial world

455
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Love's

456
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
Some digital

457
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,719
ABC has been one of the big

458
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
Companies pushing this

459
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,279
Concept but basically

460
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,839
It's a virtual version of any machine

461
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Run it

462
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
Sensor data from the physical

463
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Device

464
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:24,383
You run it against your virtual version of that device and you can use it for predictive maintenance to understand things

465
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
Things that are going wrong

466
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,991
It's both a big validation at PTC

467
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Which has been touting this

468
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Yours

469
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,647
And also a necessary component for a lot of Microsoft azure

470
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
Industrial

471
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:42,559
And you can even use this as like make a digital copy of your workspace maybe fit a large office or

472
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,887
Datacenter whatever might be created digital version of it

473
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
Duplicated essentially and again

474
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:54,847
Titan sensor data you could have just things maybe when I just temperatures and see if that affects traffic patterns or

475
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,639
Machinery whatever my paper

476
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,199
Cons of opportunity sir this is a really cool stuff

477
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,015
It is and I actually like the fact that Microsoft is

478
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,319
It's aiming this more at the

479
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:09,951
Do you say says it's showing off Hair Design War for Enterprise office space which I thought was interesting

480
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
Because PTC is all about like

481
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:16,607
I will borrow your steam trap or your flow meter or is all these crazy

482
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
Crazy devices that are very

483
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
Where is Microsoft

484
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,007
Hey what's create a virtual version of your office

485
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
See what you can do

486
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:30,431
Can I see why they did that to be honest right at first hand I cannot tell you how much time I would waste

487
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,831
This was a Google anywhere city which was a city block in 15 stories going USA conference room

488
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,903
Wasn't supposed to be occupied but still

489
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
Or

490
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
Decided to go to the

491
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,511
11th floor cafeteria for burritos

492
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,815
When the line on the fourth floor was like

493
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:53,215
Nothing it was nobody there right now so I can go up to 11 tonight

494
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:57,823
Waste for your resources on so many environmental things

495
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,687
So this is really exciting and we are going to find out

496
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,783
More maybe we'll get something from Microsoft to come on the show to talk about what this makes pasta

497
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Because

498
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,391
Okay it's like I'm from Boston all of a sudden

499
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,927
Let's talk about

500
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,975
Some quickness bit Sunday

501
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
Whiting's

502
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:23,679
Switch

503
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
They came out with their newest

504
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,567
Hybrid Smartwatch I called a hybrid because it looks like a traditional watch

505
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
Perry mechanical

506
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
Looking

507
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:38,271
Regular watch but has a small OLED display in it for your heart rate because there's a heart rate sensor in there you can check

508
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,599
Are sleep patterns in their through a Connected app

509
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
It will track your workouts

510
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Just got sensors for all that

511
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:50,559
GPS you have to have it connected GPS you have to have a phone with you if you going to go running with this thing but

512
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,399
Some people still do that that's fine two hundred bucks killer battery life

513
00:20:54,655 --> 00:21:00,799
Because it's a very small OLED display like a circular display that just had a limited amount of space in art

514
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,639
Backlight on

515
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,455
25 day battery life which is amazing

516
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,735
$200

517
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,599
It's not for me because I want a GPS in a heart rate and everything standalone

518
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,672
Which is why I wear an Apple watch

519
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,744
Tonight full fledge Smartwatch not take calls on it

520
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,584
But for a large number of people this is a perfect

521
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,656
Hybrid device it gives you what you want without

522
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:33,056
Too many constraints such as you know charging every day and so on or looking like a smartwatch so I like it if you get enough for me

523
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,336
I like what why things is doing

524
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
Okay

525
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,944
And I like that you're like it's not full-featured I mean you can't make phone calls on

526
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,016
This is not a feature that I have demanded

527
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:46,880
I was messing with my walkie-talkie feature yesterday on the Apple watch with my daughter so I'm into that stuff

528
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
No III

529
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
If I wanted

530
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,304
The stuff they showed off at the Apple event a couple weeks back with fall detection

531
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,608
Play something that I've been trying to

532
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
Program into my life

533
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
Forever

534
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Using

535
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
Amalgamated sensors

536
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
East recipes

537
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:07,616
It pull it all into one and I was very excited but not excited enough to go buy an iPhone

538
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
So I understand

539
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
Please

540
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
Please rest of the world

541
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,552
Get on that okay

542
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,088
Let's talk about

543
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,904
Okay last year

544
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,952
Was purchased by Assa abloy

545
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,024
Maker of

546
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,584
Now it's Yale locks

547
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,400
A credit to work with your August

548
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
App

549
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,728
So the August lock is not

550
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
Deadbolt

551
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Replacement

552
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
It is

553
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
Replace it over

554
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
And this is

555
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,408
This is great for some people they like it it's less

556
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Install

557
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
But

558
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,040
If you're one of those people who feel like way more secure with

559
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Replacement

560
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,624
But you like the August app

561
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Because it works with

562
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,696
Martinson is kind of interesting

563
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
You could actually

564
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,072
This feels kind of niche

565
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
There's like a homekit module

566
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
You could update your

567
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
Yale lock

568
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
Homekit module that you plug into

569
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
With that battery case

570
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,640
And it's going to work

571
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,920
With the August app and

572
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,248
That's kind of nice for a certain segment of the body

573
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Chelation

574
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,296
No doubt about it I mean

575
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:25,696
Kathy August features like door sensor don't know if the door is locked or unlocked if it's open or closed you know it's

576
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,744
You know dog has to make sense

577
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
This

578
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:34,400
Also desert Choir in very small Wi-Fi Bridge just to get the information from the lock to your network

579
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
It's not a

580
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,728
Like a big box of a bridge is more of a gesture

581
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,032
It sits on your outlet somewhere nearby

582
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,896
That exists now for those of you guys who are interested in that

583
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
Speaking of homekit

584
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,712
There is a new rachio sprinkler

585
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,504
It is getting homekit support

586
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
So

587
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,344
Yay yashow this is

588
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
Free if you have the one or two

589
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
You're not going to get it

590
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,512
You can tell Stacy doesn't use an iPhone

591
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:08,448
Population says I'm going home kit for good reason and that's fine

592
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,008
So this is good news

593
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,544
If you're that population

594
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
Here's a

595
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,592
Rachio which is

596
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,224
They're Gen 2 I tested their Gen 2 sprinkler and bought it actually for my father-in-law

597
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,504
And it's great he loves it

598
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
It's helped him quite a bit

599
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,552
So

600
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
Now you can ask Siri

601
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
Hey

602
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
Turn on my sprinklers

603
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,696
Or stop watering the vegetable garden

604
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,536
And this is $230 the Retro 3s

605
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
Expensive newer model

606
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:40,960
Okay this is just an update because I had written about this and talked about

607
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
Twitter

608
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,288
So I have these brilliant

609
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Light switches

610
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
I just had someone

611
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
Come out and

612
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,432
Replace them for me cuz I had a pre-production unit.

613
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
They felt was not

614
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
Behaving as well

615
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,576
So we're going back to the drawing board

616
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,136
Mini the things about

617
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,416
I stand by

618
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,976
And they would happen regardless of the hardware it's just the

619
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,024
The criminal light into this thing

620
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
So

621
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
I'm going to try that out again

622
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,656
And hopefully it will be a better experience

623
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,960
So stay tuned for that probably in another

624
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
And now

625
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,288
Let us go to a

626
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312

641
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,288
Start

642
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,592
Show this week's voicemail is from

643
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
Brent

644
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,968
Hello this is Brent mehr I'm calling from Utah

645
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,992
I have

646
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
A problem with my

647
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
Freezer have I

648
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Stand up

649
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
Vertical

650
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,624
Freezer that

651
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
Kids

652
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
Well sometimes leave open

653
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,488
Circus last 10 years I've lost

654
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
The contents of it

655
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:15,168
Three times and we've tried locks but sometimes they get in the way I'd really love something that would alert

656
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
Me when

657
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,472
The

658
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,544
Freezer is left open or even perhaps if

659
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,592
Temperature changes within the freezer

660
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
Thanks

661
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
Okay Brent

662
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
This is one of those

663
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:29,504
This is so easy I can't believe we have to answer question about this

664
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,088
Start at the gate

665
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,112
So

666
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
Kevin

667
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
You get started

668
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
With your solution

669
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
All right book

670
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:43,072
Probably the least expensive solution I can think of is to buy a

671
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:47,424
Door / window sensor Brands because their battery powered there

672
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
Inexpensive

673
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,496
One part goes on the

674
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:54,848
Frame of the freezer and one goes on the door and basically when the doors open

675
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,504
The center says hey I'm open and you can be notified that the doors open however you don't want to know exactly

676
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,272
Open

677
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,064
Left open

678
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,368
So in order to do that

679
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,648
It's a little more expensive

680
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Traps

681
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,744
What we don't know is if you have a smart home hub

682
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,304
You can easily set

683
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,192
I will alert that says have the sensors been part or the door's been open for more than say 2 or 3 minutes

684
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
Send me a notification

685
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,800
So we don't know if you have a hub if you do is pretty easy

686
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,848
If you don't I don't

687
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,176
You know that this is going to work because you're only get me notified that the door open

688
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,968
What clothes you're not going to know

689
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:36,576
If it left open unless you physically go back and check after you were notified it was open

690
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Yes

691
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,648
Okay so that was one option

692
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,696
And I have some other options

693
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,976
None of them are

694
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
But we found lots of

695
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
Bluetooth

696
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
Sensors that measure

697
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,888
Temperature and a lot of them have

698
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,216
Why are based temperature probe so what you would do is you take

699
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
The temperature probe

700
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,776
Plug it into the sensor

701
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,336
You stick the temperature probe inside

702
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
The freezer

703
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
Can you leave

704
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:00,896
Temperature

705
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
Nothing on the outside

706
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:08,576
Because you eat the freezer is kind of like it's going to block all signals so he part of this the part with the radio has to be outside

707
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
The freezer

708
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
Is a giant ferret

709
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,672
How do I have left open

710
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,208
Signal

711
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
Then you know

712
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,536
Temperature

713
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,096
This is a $40

714
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,888
Inkbird smart sensor

715
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,912
This is $40

716
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:23,936
And

717
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,496
Use case

718
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,592
The exception of this is blue toothpaste so you have to be within

719
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
1040

720
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,640
Feet are so

721
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
So I don't

722
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,712
Love it for this because it's not going to

723
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,504
It can send you alerts

724
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
But it's only going to send you alerts when

725
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
When you walk with him

726
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:46,976
You're not going to be able to remotely be away from home and know that the door has been left open for example either

727
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,256
Let you sit pretty

728
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,816
Why is sampling intervals so Lake

729
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,864
Between 10 seconds

730
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,960
I would say for your freezer a 10 minute intervals probably good and will save

731
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
Battery life

732
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,264
So that's just

733
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
Book If you're looking for sampling

734
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
And so that's one option

735
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,688
We did find

736
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
And

737
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,248
We don't love this for another reason

738
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,088
We found it lacrosse Mobile Wireless monitoring system

739
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,160
This one comes with a dry probe that should work just 4 in

740
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
Inside your freezer

741
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,256
It has its own little Gateway this is a $30 device

742
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,560
Gateway gives you the Wi-Fi

743
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
Please and that you need to plug in

744
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
But

745
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:30,240
To get data to your phone after the first 3 months is going to cost you

746
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
99 Cent Store

747
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,592
So that's a subscription fee associated with this

748
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
Device that space

749
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
12 bucks

750
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,248
Which is a lot cheaper than hundreds of dollars of frozen food defrosted

751
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
Yes

752
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
So

753
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:49,184
That is an option I have had lacrosse sensors in the past they tended to work for me for about 2 years before dying

754
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
So keep that in mind

755
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
This is

756
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,512
Particular

757
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
Is only 30 bucks

758
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888
And then we found

759
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
The temp stick wireless temperature sensor

760
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,520
$449

761
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
Which is pricey as heck

762
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
But it's Wi-Fi

763
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
Connect to a gateway

764
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
You're going to have to be

765
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
Changing the batteries on

766
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
Quite a bit

767
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
But this gives you everything all in

768
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:20,672
So you can be anywhere at the notified for example the freezer is open so

769
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,952
Option fee on that one right

770
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,792
But it's a big upfront cost

771
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
More than this

772
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,864
$30 +

773
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
$12

774
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:38,848
I think it's worth pointing out also that when we went down a big rabbit hole looking for all kinds of different solutions here

775
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,152
I noticed that a lot of the

776
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
Manufacturers of

777
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:48,832
Fridges and freezers are now starting to include sensors for this type of thing such a Samsung NGE for example

778
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,624
So they're in the future

779
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,744
When you do replace the freezer cuz he said it was 10 years old Can I some point it's going to have to get replaced

780
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,072
I would consider looking at one that has a sensor built-in

781
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Yes

782
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
Yes

783
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
What's the magic

784
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
All right

785
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,472
So hopefully bread

786
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
This helps you

787
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Otherwise

788
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
I think you should get rid

789
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,944
We don't really know how did they get past the locks

790
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
All right

791
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,016
So

792
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,064
That is a lot we discussed this week

793
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,088
We hope you guys

794
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,624
Enjoy this segment of the show

795
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
Please stay tuned

796
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
A conversation with

797
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
Rayford Smith

798
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,744
Who is with Entergy

799
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,328
A utility that serves 3 million customers as he explains

800
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
Holy cow

801
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
How they're bringing

802
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,912
That company

803
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
2 current digital standard

804
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,264
It's a pretty involved process in

805
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:45,920
I think it's an interesting interview so stay tuned for that and for a message from our sponsor hey everyone.

806
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:52,320
Taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is SAS

807
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:56,928
And I have json man who is the VP of iot at SAS

808
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,952
Here to talk to us

809
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,256
We talked about SAS at the edge

810
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,792
A new iot division

811
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,328
And his partner ecosystem

812
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,376
Let's talk about

813
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Hey I and II.

814
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,704
So which comes first

815
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,984
Iot data

816
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,264
Rai

817
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
That's a good question

818
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,080
You seen a lot of ink

819
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,616
Towards both topics

820
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,896
Am I singing though it's

821
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
Iot data

822
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,224
Certainly a I in

823
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
Capabilities

824
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,040
Analytic evaluation

825
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
Associated

826
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,856
With that is critical but the fact is

827
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
AI

828
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
Routines Alberta

829
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
R train

830
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
Against data

831
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
Anorexic cute

832
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,768
In my opinion

833
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,096
Okidata is required it comes first before you can achieve value

834
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
Applied artificial

835
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,960
How does AI in iot

836
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Work together

837
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,032
AI is certainly a path

838
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,056
To incite

839
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
Passive value

840
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,384
Decisioning iot infrastructure

841
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,408
On the other hand

842
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,176
Provides

843
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,456
The foundational element

844
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
4X

845
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,504
Execution of Iowa

846
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
Key principles

847
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
What you think about

848
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
To first question

849
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,112
The data is critical

850
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,952
But also as you look to the distributed environment in many cases

851
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
Just pushing to the edge

852
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,560
The models may be trained in a persistent environment AI models

853
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
In there but the execution

854
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
The volume

855
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
This generator from EX

856
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
Execution

857
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,704
Scoring of the models

858
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,776
Self can only be achieved when you have that infrastructure

859
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,056
Ford appointment

860
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,592
We talked about reduce latency

861
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
Can be a primary driver

862
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,968
Latency is reduced by pushing his decision and closer to the source

863
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,760
Updated so you can have the best

864
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
AI model in the world

865
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,064
But if you don't have the

866
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
The ability to apply at

867
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,112
At the right time

868
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
Right place

869
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
The value

870
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
Is quickly

871
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,512
Power companies applying AI to their iot data today

872
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,560
Switching examples across multiple annies

873
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,864
Mysteries usually in cases where the

874
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
Requirement is to

875
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
SF state of volume

876
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,448
Games that are just outside

877
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,008
One example is in Hi-Tech

878
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,312
Manufacturing what are using video.

879
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,592
Detect effect

880
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,152
At the most granular level all the way down

881
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,176
Pixel levels

882
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,968
Within high definition picture

883
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,016
And it provides the ability to

884
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,088
To do this at scale and generate inside into Gildan

885
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,368
Improve throughput that

886
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,648
You just couldn't do

887
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,672
Human interaction

888
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
More required

889
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,232
Awesome json so

890
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,304
Where can we go to find out more about how fast

891
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
Just helping customers use AI

892
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
In iot

893
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
So we have a landing page

894
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:18,496
Sas.com coyote it's a great starting point

895
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:23,616
For both industry use cases in horizontal messaging around on their feet

896
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:35,136
Everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

897
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:41,024
Today's guest is Reaper Smith with VP of energy technology and Analytics

898
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,304
Entergy

899
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,864
Which is an electricity and gas provider

900
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,912
Million customers

901
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
So

902
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Raeford

903
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:53,056
Let's talk about your journey because you came into this

904
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,104
Two-and-a-half years ago

905
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,152
You describe it is

906
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,968
Right it feels like a monster

907
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,808
Beginning of the Bible right in the beginning it was voided for Maleficent

908
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,624
Overtime in a we had seven days

909
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,184
More like two and a half years of trying to

910
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
Come up with

911
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,488
What defining analytic

912
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
Coming up with a guiding Prince

913
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,352
Coming up with our roadmap or strategy

914
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,936
And then ultimately now shifting into development end

915
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,216
Appointment of antelope

916
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,288
Okay so he started

917
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,568
You guys from the Dark Ages

918
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
You started with nothing

919
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,408
Now you are in a relation

920
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
22 people

921
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
You help a company

922
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,504
Deliver a 12s

923
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
Investment

924
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,112
I'm assuming buying analytics software but maybe there's more to this

925
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
So

926
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
Let's start

927
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,208
With some of the concrete

928
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
Sure

929
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,584
I was just coming up with a common definition of what

930
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
Analytics

931
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:52,448
It's amazing certain terms get used and people

932
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,240
Variation of

933
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
What they mean

934
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:59,872
But we came up with it which is really that analytics are meant to help us

935
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,664
Use data to predict

936
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,712
Create some sort of valuable out

937
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,552
That really been led to

938
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,600
What that's what analytics is

939
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,440
What are the rules of the road for how we should go about doing

940
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,256
And we came up with a series

941
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,328
Guiding principles that informed our development

942
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
One being

943
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,168
That we think analytics is synonymous with

944
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
Strategy

945
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,216
And as such

946
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,288
Cuz it's this key capability we should naps work

947
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,592
Instead we needed to develop

948
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
Those capabilities in house

949
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,200
And because it's that important that relevant

950
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,504
Toonami the growth and direction of Art

951
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
Future

952
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,600
The analects wasn't so much about technology

953
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
Tencent about

954
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:46,976
How many weird sounding things I could get in and get the objectives to pay for like Pig

955
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,744
Baidu

956
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,560
Spark and whatever it was really around

957
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,584
Change manager

958
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
How do you get

959
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,936
An organization of 13000 people

960
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,752
Already got a hundred plus years

961
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Process

962
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,848
History and everything else on the way they do things

963
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,152
To fundamentally alter

964
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,200
That way of doing business

965
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,504
So how did you do

966
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,784
Pick a project

967
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,320
Pick up

968
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
System

969
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,392
You're kind of talking philosophically the lips

970
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,280
So yeah so it's really important so we set about creating an analytics roadmap

971
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,864
Which was our strategy is a three-year strategy for how to act

972
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,448
And fundamentally create that chain

973
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,080
The route map in and of itself the process to create it was the first step in creating the change

974
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,896
We gave it The Guiding principles we gave it

975
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,968
Architectural high-level architecture what we wanted to accomplish

976
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,808
We really executed the change through a whole series of workshops that we

977
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,344
We did it

978
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:51,488
The first of which was to identify where the value was that we

979
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,304
And more than just Fanta results

980
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,120
Conan just on financial results you

981
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,424
Send it when I called the Grim Reaper affect which

982
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,752
I'm here and I'm using air quotes I'm here to help

983
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,336
And you cut the budget just once and then you're never invited back

984
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:10,688
And so we knew we needed to get outside of just the narrow or myopic

985
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
Benefit

986
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,808
The workshops really helped us do that we would go eat

987
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,112
Speak with the executives and then later we do

988
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
For the workshops with

989
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
13 * 2

990
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
Identify

991
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,464
Pain points

992
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,512
What kind of value they thought they

993
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
Create Beyond just the dollars

994
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,632
Sense that process also help us uncover

995
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,680
Talent within our own organization

996
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,568
We as a company didn't think we had if I well we're just going to have to build the organization from

997
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,408
Hiring everyone from the outside there's no one inside the company

998
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
Can you walk with you

999
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:50,624
An example of one of the workshops that what the team did what they were trying to tell you to tackle

1000
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,208
Sure sure so. It's important who was in the workshop

1001
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:58,560
So the first workshops we would typically do they were about 2 hours long

1002
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,864
And in the workshop we had a purse

1003
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,680
Me or someone from the Enterprise analytics area

1004
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,960
Meaning we also brought in

1005
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,496
Consulting outside support

1006
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,032
We wanted to bring him

1007
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,616
Someone to facilitate that conversation that kind of been there done that

1008
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
So that they could help

1009
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,688
Guide the conversation

1010
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,480
As a neutral third-party

1011
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
I think it also layer in

1012
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,320
Hey I've seen this elsewhere here something

1013
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,856
Hangouts you haven't thought of where you

1014
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,672
And then of course we also brought it with

1015
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,464
Our organization is not

1016
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
Part of the information technology

1017
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,792
Organization where I actually like I said

1018
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,096
If analytics is strategies

1019
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
Strategies

1020
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,704
But we did bring it because there a key player in

1021
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Getting access

1022
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,520
Most of the data standing up

1023
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,544
System

1024
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
Keeping it patched

1025
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,664
And then we also started at least the first conversations

1026
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,688
2 hour one

1027
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,992
Executive Suite to the major organ

1028
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:53,088
That typically the way the process will always start with

1029
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,368
What is Analytics

1030
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,416
Write just a simple question

1031
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:02,304
Trying to get everybody to bring out their ideas have a conversation around largely to coalesce around that

1032
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,352
Forward-looking view up

1033
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,632
You want to use Analytics

1034
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,168
Freedom Valu black

1035
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:07,936
Predictive

1036
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,776
That was usually the first 30 to 45 minutes

1037
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,336
And the remainder the conversation was on

1038
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,360
High-level paint

1039
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,920
Where in your organization

1040
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,712
You really see opportunity

1041
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:25,088
Interspersed into that we would give them a state of what is the art of the possible

1042
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,880
That was tuned to the area

1043
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
Supply chain

1044
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,976
It was another reason why we brought third party

1045
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,256
Military wise

1046
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,584
Have a conversation Saved By the way supply chain

1047
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,120
Outside of our industry

1048
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
What's your summer

1049
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
Interesting things you can do

1050
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,568
We'll use that is kind of a way to stir the pot and help create

1051
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,592
Interest

1052
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:51,200
We would ask him vaguely high-level questions but where's your data

1053
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,248
Where your Key Systems those switches

1054
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,528
That's the first

1055
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,296
Conversation

1056
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,112
We then would go to in-depth conversation

1057
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
Update full day

1058
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,232
Then based on the areas that they identified in that

1059
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,048
How long did this process

1060
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,096
Within different word

1061
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,656
About a 3-month process

1062
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,264
We spend another two months after that though harmonizing all the results

1063
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,288
We found so we

1064
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,616
At the end of the day we created not only a series of use cases

1065
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
Christmas tree

1066
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,944
This is of interest to us

1067
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,480
This is the value we think we

1068
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
Free from it

1069
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
Here's where the data we think

1070
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,576
We need for that is

1071
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,624
And here's the rough Bar Association we might want

1072
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:37,024
We have a synthesizer harmonize all that because obviously how one team might make an assumption of Valium

1073
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,304
Different than another

1074
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
We need a time to come

1075
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,400
Bring all that stuff together so roughly from

1076
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,960
Initiation to about the six-month mark

1077
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,984
Is how long it took

1078
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,776
To go through the full process

1079
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:51,104
Workshops interviews executive updates and then

1080
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,943
Harmonization and ultimately creating this roadmap in terms of where we

1081
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,271
Okay so now you have a road map

1082
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,087
This when you brought inventors or

1083
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,391
Did you have them in beforehand like

1084
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,183
What's after the route

1085
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:10,559
Yeah well so there's one key question you have to ask while doing the roadmap that we had to get in

1086
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,095
And that is

1087
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,911
What kind of way do you want to cross

1088
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,471
Another word for towards

1089
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:21,823
The places with the low-hanging fruit or readily available data

1090
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,847
Or do you want it

1091
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,895
Step back and take a more Enterprise

1092
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,455
We call them that no business unit left

1093
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,479
Behind strategy

1094
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,551
But we went around we surveyed all the senior

1095
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,391
With focusing on one or two areas

1096
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,183
But that creates the halves

1097
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,207
And the Have Nots

1098
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,999
And you may be a have

1099
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,583
But you're likely going to be a half not are you okay with that

1100
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,143
By the way if we do the Haves and Have Nots

1101
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,679
We might go a little faster

1102
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
To start with

1103
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,519
But it might create some unintended

1104
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,591
It's right because the Have Nots my team up and go well

1105
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:58,943
I really didn't work for me

1106
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,295
Alt-right terrible Silo don't want to create silage from the

1107
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,343
Heading into a person every one of the leaders

1108
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,623
Demon energy said

1109
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,415
We want you to go with the Enterprise

1110
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:12,767
Which was really great because it allowed us to take a longer View

1111
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,863
And it's far more comprehensive you about how to

1112
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
Roulette

1113
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,191
Architected and ultimately emblem

1114
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:26,335
So when we got the business cases and all the roadmap in the strategy that we

1115
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,359
You said okay this is what word

1116
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
2

1117
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,919
It been created the next

1118
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,991
Fertilprep to do which is okay now we have to go pick tools

1119
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,063
That conform with our architecture on our strategy

1120
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,599
We need to hire

1121
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,367
Do we have

1122
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,647
Literally knows that

1123
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,719
And we have to do this in a very short amount of time because

1124
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:46,559
Company wants to start recognizing benefits as soon as they

1125
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,887
So we went down a couple Tracker boats hiring

1126
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
And

1127
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:56,031
Going out until you shoot a whole bunch of rfps for particular components that we went through

1128
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,847
Define nauseous the tools like

1129
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
Yale tour guide

1130
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,711
Are you going to govern your data what are you going to store it in

1131
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,759
But also

1132
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,295
Some more importantly was

1133
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,111
Are you going to enhance the data that you already got

1134
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:14,463
We knew from the very moment that we started that our data wasn't very good

1135
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,255
And there was a lot of data we just didn't

1136
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,095
And so we knew we had to augment our data as much as we

1137
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:20,863
We had a manager

1138
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,959
Relaunch recipes

1139
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,007
We Begin the hiring process

1140
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,591
And by the end of the year we had selected

1141
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,407
Vendors that we thought we really wanted

1142
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:38,271
And we had also begun rnfl pirate we did not finish the hiring though

1143
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
About

1144
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,087
Really up until about the last two weeks

1145
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
So the me

1146
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,159
On the vendor side

1147
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,695
What kinds of things

1148
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,719
You decide to

1149
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,743
So what are they

1150
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,399
So I would say that I like to explain things

1151
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,447
The two are senior Executives using

1152
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
Cartoons

1153
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:01,055
RIT infrastructure and our human capital

1154
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,103
Spring from the womb and

1155
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,663
Work effort something 30 years in our industry

1156
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,479
Knowing the ins-and-outs about analytics

1157
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:13,599
And so far everything into four different categories of things using a card

1158
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,879
Arthur really

1159
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:18,719
Simple easy to understand we said really there for parts to RL example

1160
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:19,999
The first

1161
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:24,095
Human capital write the driver or the passengers are really important

1162
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:28,703
They're going to tell you where you're going and they're going to steer the car

1163
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,007
Second part of it is

1164
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,079
The fuel for the car which is your data right

1165
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,919
How do you move your data how do you manage your data how do you augment

1166
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
Governor

1167
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,759
That's the second major category

1168
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,575
The third was the engine

1169
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,135
Consumes the fuel to create the

1170
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,695
Does the mechanical energy to move you down the road

1171
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,047
It is the inside itself right

1172
00:45:56,351 --> 00:46:02,495
I had a meeting with Executives and said I'd like to talk to you about a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity

1173
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,287
Fastest way to end a meeting right

1174
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
Beijing

1175
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,847
Don't want to talk about that

1176
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,151
But you say I'd like to talk about

1177
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,223
I'm inside a really cool inside that we did for your area

1178
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,015
That resonates far more

1179
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,343
I've got to find a way to take the math that you built in the engine

1180
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,159
Visualize it and created and put it in a way that

1181
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,695
Really helps Executives understand

1182
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,463
Just what the hell

1183
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,303
In my car exhaust right

1184
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,375
It helps you see what the engine produce

1185
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:34,495
But it also helps you monitor what's happening what's going on

1186
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,823
And so forth

1187
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,615
Key components of what we're doing

1188
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,431
And we're going to try and RFP and

1189
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,967
Find Partners to helping

1190
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,551
Obviously human capital were going to hire

1191
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,367
How we did it that's how we went about structuring it

1192
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:55,999
And each of those areas that we also had to be mindful because the company isn't just trying to transform using Analytics

1193
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,047
Trying to transform everything

1194
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,071
All at once

1195
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,167
We are doing our smart meter deployment or Ami deployment going on right now

1196
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:07,775
We are at the same time changing out roughly 70% of our it infrastructure

1197
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
Adult management

1198
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,151
You name it it's all in there and then change out

1199
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,735
The same time we are trying to rebuild our infrastructure for Analytics

1200
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,807
We're attempting to launch products and services with our customers

1201
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,599
Remake and rebuild our grid

1202
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:25,183
Shelley Angela not all this change going on simultaneously

1203
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:31,071
So we had two in that contact we had to also coordinate with all those other teams and go like

1204
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:37,215
NRP for this but we need you all to be part of that RFP process because while you're putting in your things

1205
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,775
We have to put in our time we all got to sing Kumbaya

1206
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,871
And have one big group hug at the end of this to make sure that we're going in the same direction

1207
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,175
So those were all resolved

1208
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
Credited sent out

1209
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,271
Yes absolutely.

1210
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,551
So now you

1211
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,343
Biot that are thieves out

1212
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,391
Starting on YouTube

1213
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,183
Where are you and what are your

1214
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,975
Shores

1215
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,023
You really get a diversity of responses

1216
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,839
In or instance we got a whole bunch of results

1217
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,471
Anyone tried to do what

1218
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
You were doing

1219
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:13,567
And our executive became a little worried they were like

1220
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,871
We really like what you're doing the world so nervous about it

1221
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,687
We had to talk to them through about How We Do lyrics

1222
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
Re-implement

1223
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,551
Risking the process to select even vendors and partners

1224
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,647
Which is to say that an alarm strategy was really built around Flex

1225
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
Ability

1226
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,951
Around standards

1227
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,535
Around broad industry acceptance not just our own engine

1228
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,351
We found that

1229
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
Taper example

1230
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,935
Open source is great

1231
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,495
But at the same time I have a CFO I have a

1232
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,519
General counsel

1233
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:47,871
Eva CEO and they worry incessantly over the operations of our business

1234
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:54,783
Are compromised in wanting to get the flexibility and the growth in the capability that open source off

1235
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,087
Was to buy a license

1236
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,391
After all Hadoop is

1237
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,439
And itself an open-source capability but

1238
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,463
License

1239
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,791
Similarly we went with a platform

1240
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,375
What size because it really was broadly used

1241
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
Well beyond

1242
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,703
I never really intended just for RN

1243
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,007
We knew we could Flex

1244
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,031
Really quickly

1245
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:21,663
On any number of problems that are Executives might come up with whether it was a safety

1246
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:22,943
Customer

1247
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,783
Audit supply chain nuclear anything they could come up with

1248
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:30,367
If we picked those tools and conform to those prints

1249
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,439
And did you also as you were evaluating them

1250
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:36,767
Test how well these things could work together in these

1251
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,303
Player's head work together

1252
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,071
Correctly

1253
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
Because

1254
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,167
These things have to work together as a system and that could be

1255
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:48,031
Yeah oh yeah could be a huge pain point in Nebraska

1256
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
That's why

1257
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:53,663
We in the rfps as well as in our roadmap development we spent a lot of time talking

1258
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,687
Architecture

1259
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,479
And about how those different pieces

1260
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,527
Integrate well with each other

1261
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:02,367
We really wanted to make sure that to the extent you're going to pick

1262
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,647
One solution

1263
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:10,047
That it work well in an ecosystem and had a proven track record of working well on ecosystem

1264
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,119
Studio Luxe year-and-a-half

1265
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,167
So what came after that where we ended

1266
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:18,239
Yeah so we started we continue to hire

1267
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,287
We started out with hiring five data scientist

1268
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:23,359
3D to Engineers one director for the organization

1269
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,919
As well as a data governance manager in an agile

1270
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:29,759
Savory necessary early components

1271
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:35,391
Infamous meeting with our CFO general counsel saying what we've got lots of different ways to prioritize use

1272
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
This case is here

1273
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,695
What do you want to start with

1274
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,255
And there at least 8 different ways we came up

1275
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,143
Yeah which means if you have a way to prioritize you have no way to prioritize

1276
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,679
The end

1277
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,983
Customer is our number one issue right now

1278
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,519
You really need to work on customers

1279
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,591
Go find some easy winds are from the customer

1280
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,639
So that's where we started

1281
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:02,015
With our while we were doing all the hiring everything else we've also started to try some of this risk

1282
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,855
In that time we prosecuted 19 of our initial 100

1283
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,879
42 use case

1284
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,719
142 use cases

1285
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,999
142

1286
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,839
Gas are really well and what's so funny is

1287
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:20,703
We did after we will start work on the 19 what's really important that we get back

1288
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,471
Hell

1289
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,751
All the executives

1290
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,823
What we've been up to but we kind of went quiet there at wework

1291
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,919
Wake of the RFP process if we were picking Solutions Contracting

1292
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,967
Tell everybody

1293
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:38,111
I'm afraid that was really meant to go around and talk to all the executives

1294
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,903
Here's what you saw

1295
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,439
Here's what we've done

1296
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,719
Are the results we've gotten

1297
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
Today

1298
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,023
19

1299
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
12

1300
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,071
That's r12x return

1301
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,887
The good part about the parade that was

1302
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:55,519
What person every executive every leadership team that we talked with reservation was blown away with the results

1303
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,055
Gotten so far

1304
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:01,407
Those were primarily all in a customer area everything from food forecasting to

1305
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,711
Segmentation and propensity models

1306
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,015
Things we could use again and again and again

1307
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,807
Providing instant benefits

1308
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
Company

1309
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:14,975
They were also some that we could use in our future deployments for technology Ami Advanced metering infrastructure

1310
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,023
Takes years to deploy

1311
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:20,095
We are ready now with some of those capabilities because we

1312
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,375
Filthy early stop

1313
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,399
Priortax

1314
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,727
We went around to the parade deck

1315
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,007
The unintended

1316
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,311
Someone into the consequence was that now

1317
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:33,407
All those Executives were so excited by what we had done already they wanted us to work on

1318
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,455
Right there feeling like half

1319
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:41,599
Right exactly into that triggered the next round of why we need to start hiring is

1320
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:46,207
We need to go ahead and staff up those capabilities but if your resources come on and shocks

1321
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,255
You really need to flex

1322
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,815
Capabilities that you bring in from the outside

1323
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,375
And so what we've been doing in that process

1324
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,167
We have Consulting agreements

1325
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:59,007
Long as we can form with the architecture in the standards of what we've done

1326
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,055
To use third parties to come in and

1327
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
Help us

1328
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:08,223
Manage our workload between your initial hiring to our next level of hiring a smoothie

1329
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,807
Capabilities for all these different organization saying

1330
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,111
Me too I want some of this stuff also

1331
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,951
Until these are things that can be easily codified in

1332
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,719
So

1333
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
Random

1334
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,815
People outside the organization

1335
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,143
Yasmin use case

1336
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,727
Development process from initial idea all the way to hand over

1337
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:34,335
We do not own any of the models at the end of the day that's really important

1338
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:38,175
From a change management perspective because of the results

1339
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:42,015
But if a business owns the model and they own the result and therefore they

1340
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
Change

1341
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,831
Just one of our key drivers

1342
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,879
But for us when we think about this

1343
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,671
Journey and pain

1344
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,975
Getting to where they were ization

1345
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,023
Has this innate capability

1346
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:56,351
Are you skis process has a really rigorous.

1347
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,399
Tatian process wrapped around it

1348
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,471
We also invited a lot of different players we invite in finance

1349
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:04,287
If you want them to document the benefits that are coming

1350
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:09,919
We don't think that keeps us honest and also keep us out of the Grim Reaper business of trying to cut other people's budget

1351
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:14,783
We bring an it because they are critically important that getting the data and getting access

1352
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,599
Make sure the infrastructure is up and running the way it ought to

1353
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,927
And we do that and of course the business units the customer themselves

1354
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,207
They're the domain X

1355
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,023
May we bring data science City engineering Adida governance

1356
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:31,679
We use that process Auto to dictate our order in which we govern data upgrade infrastructure Etc

1357
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,983
Use cases determine the order

1358
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:39,871
Exciting is probably not the right word but that was really educational that was a very good to dive into something that's so many

1359
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:41,919
Thank you

1360
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:48,831
