00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:13,056
Hey everyone this is Stacey Higginbotham and you are listening to The Internet of Things

2
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:13,824
Podcast

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,848
I am your host

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,384
And she's co-host

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,152
Is

6
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,992
That's right y'all Kevin is a Google IO

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,040
Actually so is yonko

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,464
But something in 4k

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:31,488
He's busy

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,024
Spelling is Nuova.

11
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,560
Exactly

12
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,352
Yonko is

13
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,912
Former colleague of mine from Ikea

14
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,728
He is the smartest man in the room if you want to talk about

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,824
Well a lot of things but the fate of digital media television

16
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,128
Like both hardware and Zack

17
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,664
Programming and

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
I don't know what else yonko

19
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,648
Good I was always exciting

20
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
Weather for this week

21
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,720
And I should get right to it because I

22
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,744
I think there's a bunch of

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
Google News throughout

24
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
Vishal today right

25
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:11,424
We have a lid actually we have the words with Nest to be confused

26
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,728
Basically

27
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,056
Just announced a whole bunch of new Integrations for the

28
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
Works with Nest program

29
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,896
So we're going to talk about a couple of them

30
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,224
Most notably for a lot of old-school smart-home people

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,552
The Belkin WeMo finally works now with

32
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,320
The nest

33
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,416
So this is exciting because a lot of people have wemos

34
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:37,024
And it works with your nest thermostat so if your thermostat notices the house is empty

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
Light skin turn off

36
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,632
Maybe your Crock-Pot or your curling iron whatever is in there

37
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
What I saw at Weston

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
It does

39
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
Lucretia how that works

40
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Two cameras work

41
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Each other

42
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,528
Oh so this is the August doorbell cam

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,600
Okay so this is actually cool so the August doorbell cam

44
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
Basically what you do

45
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,440
Is when someone

46
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
Comes to your door

47
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
Eventually the August

48
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
Emotion sensor

49
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,864
As part of this soda

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,168
And utility comes when the August doorbell is like

51
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,752
Hey something's at the door and what'll happen is it will trigger your

52
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,312
Camera

53
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
Basically being able to say

54
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,920
Because they have this August Access program

55
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,016
Can say the person at my door it's the guy from Postmates

56
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
Delivering something

57
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,600
You can actually let him into your house

58
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
If you have an August lock

59
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,720
Now if you have an S cam you can also keep an eye on it

60
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
While he drives whatever inside your

61
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,280
Front door

62
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
So

63
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
The light bulb

64
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
Integration made

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
More off your scent

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,704
Beware the camera senses motion

67
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
10

68
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,264
Lightbox go on or off

69
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
If you want to

70
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
Exactly

71
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
Dollars for you

72
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,504
So there's one that I want to talk about because I think it's

73
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,808
I don't know if it's pee or if it's going to be like

74
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
The Breakthrough device

75
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
It makes the Internet of Things

76
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
Things useful for like

77
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Middle America

78
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,488
I don't know if we talked about the

79
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,304
Febreze connect but basically this is one of those

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
You know how you can

81
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
Plugin sense

82
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,424
It's not potpourri it's like those sensory

83
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
Essential oils

84
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
You can actually

85
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Plug the P&G

86
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,336
Febreze Connect into an outlet in

87
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
Control it from your smartphone

88
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,432
So what they done with their nest integration is

89
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
They've got algorithms

90
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
Because everyone has to have them

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
That will actually

92
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,064
Time your

93
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
Thermostat

94
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,136
Spike turning on the hbac

95
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,976
Whiskey release a fragrance in your house so like

96
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
Fragrances disbursed

97
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
Most efficiently

98
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
Okay

99
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,864
What kind of extensor doesn't smell

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Aladdin one Rohan.

101
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,032
Yeah so I kind of like

102
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:01,664
But I really am curious because the pg4 rescan it is what it is like

103
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
Maybe it's like an ant

104
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,040
Grandma or someone always has those like fragrance

105
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
It was in their house right

106
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
I don't have them

107
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,280
Maybe it's when you turn 40 or 50 you get this and I just haven't experienced it yet

108
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,703
Baby. So anyway I'm really curious to see

109
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,519
If people find this really useful because

110
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,359
It's a product a lot of people buy already and it's actually relatively

111
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
So I don't know

112
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
So

113
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
AR

114
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Worth mentioning

115
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,391
Just in general some of the other companies that it's going to work with is a thermostat to work with Lutron

116
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,463
Misfit Waxman which is a water leak

117
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
Sensor so

118
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
This is cool because if it detects

119
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,327
There's a leak and your way from home

120
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,167
It's going to give you a one touch dial to an emergency contact

121
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
Hopefully we will eventually

122
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:02,591
Instead of just being able to call someone and be like hey something's making my house go turn off the water would be awesome if

123
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
Here's the number of local plumber

124
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
That's a business model

125
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
So I have a question

126
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
You sing this

127
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,647
Is Nest sort of

128
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,743
I mean obviously everybody likes to work with other devices but everybody else

129
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,303
Do you think that is is part of it like

130
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,095
Tassets mix together

131
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
Dick Hannah Lofton

132
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
How many devices

133
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
He said I could

134
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
So the way Nest has

135
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,175
People share data with it like Nest is very limiting

136
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,223
With what people can do on its play

137
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,319
So some companies like SmartThings had decided it didn't want to work with nest

138
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:49,183
Because it didn't like the terms other companies have talked to me behind the scenes and said

139
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,327
Just ask them to do a lot that they didn't want to do and it first they didn't have the power to say noted

140
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
But now that they're

141
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,167
More platforms out there that they could integrate with

142
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,215
To have negotiating power with nest

143
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,543
So I think there's kind of a power shift happening in the industry

144
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
Competitive thing

145
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,407
I don't know we don't see a camera on here

146
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,455
Example I don't see any

147
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
Fire smoke detector

148
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
I don't think that desk

149
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
Could resend

150
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
It's

151
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
Program

152
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:21,951
From somebody who has an established thing so you know it's got so many lighting kind of things I don't think that if it

153
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,023
Ever decided to introduce a light bulb that I could take all those others back

154
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
Because

155
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
Users would probably revolt

156
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,655
So I guess the answer here is

157
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
Nest is kind of growing and learning ally

158
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
The industry as a whole

159
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
And I'm guessing

160
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,591
What I would look for is the security stuff

161
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
They don't have a lot of

162
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,199
Security sensors or anything like that so I'd be curious

163
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Skitto

164
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
How that kids integrated

165
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
We don't see a lot of those.

166
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
Decorations

167
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Travis just

168
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
Especially

169
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
In light of the

170
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
Confucius over there with

171
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Getting you

172
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
New devices on the house

173
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
Launching new devices

174
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
Power struggle

175
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Having some of that maybe

176
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
But

177
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
It's interesting to see like this

178
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
These moves under those

179
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Google sites

180
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
It is

181
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
I think

182
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,175
For a while nested no

183
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,479
How it wanted to play the smart home game

184
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,855
Seed a little bit to the reality of the industry which people buy one else devices

185
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
Instead of hugs and hugs are just too hard

186
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,207
Plus that's not a strategy they ever really

187
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
Working and pursuing

188
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
So I don't know

189
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
Bassinet stuff

190
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,399
I want to talk real fast about some big news that actually happened last week

191
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
Which was

192
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,239
Amazon web services launched an iot button

193
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
Basically

194
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
It's like the Amazon Dash buttons

195
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
So those are that

196
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
One press button

197
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Is that you

198
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
Can use order like

199
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
Certain products

200
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
Brita water filters

201
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,503
Toilet paper

202
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
Do you have a dash button

203
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:57,183
Okay me either I've never been like super excited about it but this

204
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
Is basically a programmable button

205
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
That connects to

206
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:05,887
The Amazon iot Cloud so Amazon Lambda and what's interesting there

207
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,447
Where is it people are super excited about it because

208
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,263
Right now getting a device on to Amazon's iot cloud

209
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:16,383
Requires you to get a certificate

210
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
Enter the code on the back of this

211
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
Iot dash button

212
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
And boom your device is online and

213
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
You can start playing with it

214
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
So

215
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,415
To me this is kind of fun because it's a marketing move and it also gives you like

216
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
Ability to be liked

217
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,231
Turn on my Hue Lights

218
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
Quick

219
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
Do that

220
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
Exciting

221
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
How did the differences

222
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
Specifically for Developers

223
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,655
Exodus not something that

224
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
You would envision

225
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,007
Gettings consumers like this

226
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
The first step

227
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Amazon

228
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
White label e-juice at some point

229
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Settings

230
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,503
1 this is totally for developers It's 1999

231
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
Find a ticket sold out right now

232
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
This is to get them to try

233
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
I forbid you actually have to learn

234
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,207
Like so I talked to someone who is set up

235
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
A Raspberry Pi

236
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,839
As their home automation Hub and they use this to connect

237
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Route command

238
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,215
From the dash button to AWS Back Down 2

239
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
Wichita to like their lights

240
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
So

241
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
They had the three press it's a it's a

242
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
One single press

243
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
A double press

244
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
Lawncrest

245
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
3 button options

246
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,807
They said it was fun but this is also they also pointed out this only has a thousand clicks

247
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
Before it runs out of batteries

248
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,671
You throw it out and get it

249
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,999
So I don't think this is going to be like this huge thing

250
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
Super home because most people don't

251
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,607
Program and you can't just be theirs

252
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
GUI interface

253
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,471
Hue Lights over tula

254
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
The button

255
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,799
Programa as easily as I could like

256
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,687
But I think it's good because right now in the cloud Wars

257
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
The warrior for iot is

258
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
The word for develop

259
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,111
And this puts Amazon kind of in a stronger position to get them

260
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
Right now probably

261
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
Microsoft Azure is one of the

262
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
The number one clouds for

263
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
The Internet of Things

264
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
And then IBM

265
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,839
And its iot foundation

266
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Cloud

267
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
It's probably

268
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
Second

269
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
So

270
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,263
Alright yonko you just got back from CVS

271
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
Yes

272
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
Just got back from Shanghai

273
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
I don't even know how many hours ago because

274
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
That's quite a jacket

275
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,735
But it was sad

276
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
Interesting events with cas

277
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,087
Obviously everybody knows the main Show in Las Vegas

278
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
DeSoto

279
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
A couple of

280
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Spin-off

281
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
Cities around the world

282
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
But csho tries to be the

283
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
The whole wheel trade show

284
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
Specific event than Asia

285
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Unifocus

286
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
And this year

287
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
I was there last

288
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
Egg for 3 days

289
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Show happen

290
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
And it's

291
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Chinese

292
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,783
Oh you got to explain cuz yonko you and I were at CES together so

293
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
Yes

294
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
To be honest

295
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
I mean it's it's as much smaller show so I think

296
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
In Las Vegas today

297
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,255
I don't know how to 20000

298
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
50000

299
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
Attendees every year something

300
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
Hear that 30000

301
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
And was also at

302
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
300 exhibitors

303
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
Magical anyway you could actually see

304
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Almost everyday

305
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
But it was a little hard to understand

306
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
It was in China and

307
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
That was very

308
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
The folks on the

309
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,087
So I try to find my way around anyway and try to see you

310
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,439
Reckful riding outside

311
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
The media Focus

312
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
And there wasn't quite as much

313
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
Ragazza media Austin

314
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
Shipping devices

315
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Thanks

316
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
In part because I didn't have any TV stand

317
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,799
Exhibiting in Santiago Peak

318
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,663
TV's really didn't play that much of a role which was kind of surprising

319
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
But everything else bad drones

320
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
They had IRT they had

321
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,599
Weird fun devices to haneda robotic suitcases

322
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,927
It was kind of cool it's a it's a suitcase of kind of follows you around

323
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
You hold a sensor on your hand and it dries

324
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Behind

325
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
Tickets at the airport

326
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Pretty cool

327
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
I like it when is that coming out

328
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Butts

329
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
A lot of things to be honest that had

330
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Big Sean

331
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
Previous in CSS

332
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
It was weird

333
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
Especially pets

334
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,807
You have a lot of Cs and out in all states

335
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
You are

336
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
Twice now together

337
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
When you franchise a little further into

338
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
To the hearts

339
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
You would like

340
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,743
Who would make a massaging West

341
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:52,351
Well the people who does it go to CSS Rancho de adictos other people with me

342
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
Pretty weird products

343
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
Interesting stuff

344
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,359
And any cool Smart Home Trends or anything like that or was it pretty much the same

345
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,967
I think it was a lot of the same things except a lot of

346
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,271
Cause of Chinese takes

347
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,319
Trends

348
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
Pop that has to do with

349
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Light companies.

350
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
Business

351
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,791
So you can look you up

352
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
That's right and

353
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,119
Facebook Snapchat

354
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
Just one of those other exam

355
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
And then there are big

356
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
People have this conception

357
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Chinese cat

358
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,871
I think it's partially true partially that's whatever

359
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
Anthony. But there are some obvious example

360
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,479
Ding dong ding dong

361
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Is

362
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
Did Chinese Amazon Echo

363
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
John Bailey

364
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,623
And it's made by jd.com

365
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
Chinese speak

366
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
Meijer retailer

367
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,487
So they decided to make that one smart speaker

368
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
I think the exterior

369
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,607
Last year but they just added more capabilities to it

370
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
So it's not black

371
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
Wind speed

372
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,727
That's not quite as round

373
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
Olympic death

374
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
Shape

375
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
But it does a lot of the same things

376
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
Ask question

377
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
I can't read some stuff

378
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
The news

379
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
Korea calendar

380
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,247
You can play music on

381
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
And

382
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
All those things

383
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
Thing that you can do which was

384
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Surprising

385
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
That was the first

386
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
That's what everyone does

387
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,279
Yeah I think so maybe that's

388
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,143
But yeah so they told me they were going to add that as well and

389
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
I thought it was interesting

390
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,215
Because it's a very popular product

391
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
The US and

392
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,311
Supposedly it's inspiring companies that Google to do the same

393
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,639
Officer assaulted by big companies in China

394
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,967
Alright well we got to cut this short

395
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,527
So thank you so much Uncle for coming in

396
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
Thanks

397
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,999
Hi we're going to have a quick message with Kevin bomber who's CEO of my devices in a quick sponsor

398
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Good interview

399
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,911
Hey baby how's it going

400
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
You're here to talk about cayenne

401
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
What is cayenne

402
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,311
So Kyon is the world's first

403
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
Dragon drop

404
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,383
Iot project Builder

405
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,967
That empowers users to quickly create iot projects

406
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
So we're literally talking

407
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,575
You're taking an iot project Down 2 minutes

408
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Instead of

409
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
Mutts

410
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
And why did you build this

411
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:30,047
The primary reason is when you look across the landscape of iot platforms are out there there's hundreds of them

412
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:35,935
Organizations who want to start building iot projects just don't want to spend the time or the money

413
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,031
Did it takes to get invested in one of these large iot platform

414
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,591
So even though ours is a very powerful plant

415
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:48,991
For misery easy to get up and running literally in minutes and we launched this at the end of January 2016 Ranieri

416
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,599
20000 developers and we think we're satisfied

417
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,159
Create rules and triggers you can do scheduling

418
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:02,559
Are you going to visualization and business intelligence so we think it's a great way to get started with an iot project we wanted to be the

419
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
AutoCAD for iot

420
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,655
All right so where can you find Cayenne

421
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:11,263
Stacy the easiest way to get it is to go to my devices. Com

422
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,615
Or you can go on to the Google Play Store and search for cayenne

423
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:22,015
From my devices or on the iPhone store so it's available as an app or off of my devices. Com

424
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,831
Thank you so much Kevin thank you

425
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:34,815
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is Stacey Higginbotham and I am here

426
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,119
Rick clemmer who is the president in

427
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
CEO of Xanax

428
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
Hey Rick how you doing today

429
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Terrific

430
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,055
Thanks a lot for having us I'm so excited

431
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
VR technology for

432
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
I want to ask you so many questions

433
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
First let selfie

434
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
People what NF

435
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
So our real focus is

436
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,783
Providing secure connection

437
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,415
For the smarter world you know what you call it internet of things we're not really sure what the internet of things really is

438
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,231
So we like to call it this morning world which is more include

439
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
Includes wearables

440
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
Include smartrdriver

441
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
So as we think about

442
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
The Internet of Things or is

443
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
People like to think about the Internet of Things

444
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,311
We actually think about it as a smart of world and how we can make all of our Lives easier and safer and more

445
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
Secure okay well that kills my first Quest

446
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
Like it's too many things

447
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,015
So you guys make all of these chips

448
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
You make microprocessor

449
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
The tiny little brains

450
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
Who makes sensors

451
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,695
We do

452
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
Secure things that organizes things

453
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:42,655
We do anything else we make the connectivity to be able to do it and importantly we make the security

454
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,055
For example the chip that's on if you've recently gotten a bank card that has a chip in it we make

455
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
There's a good chance that we make

456
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,175
The ship that's on your card in fact if you're in China

457
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,503
And you have a contactless card which is more advanced than the US

458
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
Payment cards

459
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,855
There's a virtually a assurance that it's an egg

460
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
Picture of associated with it

461
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,439
Alright so this week you guys did

462
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,231
Really too cool announcement

463
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,303
I'm sure you did more than just too cool announcements but I'm thinking about

464
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
The coolest

465
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,655
And one of those was the first of those

466
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Was

467
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
With a smart car

468
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
You guys

469
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Have our work

470
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
Blue Button

471
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,407
Department of Defense

472
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:30,783
Department of energy

473
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
Yeah

474
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:38,975
Yeah so what we're basically doing is providing the capability for car companies and for the men

475
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
Manufacturers that are providing

476
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,815
Technology for the car companies

477
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,375
Actually have a demonstrated will product

478
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,935
So that's the Computing horsepower has them

479
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:54,079
Microcontroller that we use for automotive it also has a microprocessor that's out of her digital networks business

480
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,663
It has all kinds of sensor capability and software

481
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,735
12 users to really experiment with a.

482
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,015
What's with assisted driving

483
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
With automated driving

484
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,599
Figure out how you can make driving more safe

485
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,135
If you look at that

486
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,951
Through basically the third level

487
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:15,071
It's about 80% of the semiconductor content of a completely self-driving car but

488
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,351
It really provides

489
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Much more

490
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,679
Safety it provides much more assistance

491
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,751
What's the driver about 85% of all accidents

492
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,287
What's the did happen today

493
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
Are created by driver error

494
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,943
So if we can make the driver smarter but they're running the more information or helping them out

495
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,735
It will make driving Cypress

496
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
So 80 /

497
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
Percent of

498
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Conductor Conte

499
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
My car is

500
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
Adidas today

501
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
No not today

502
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:46,815
I think when we look at it going forward you know the significant growth engine associated with components

503
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,631
Will be in the p****** 8 oz

504
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,215
If you look at the Innovations in the automotive industry

505
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:59,615
About 90% of the Innovations in the automotive industry is coming from Electronics today so it's not coming would steal its

506
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,455
You know with different forms of them mechanical

507
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,247
Platform Electronics

508
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
Ixtel driving innovation

509
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,319
And the car today but 90% of it

510
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,903
It really the area that we see the most opportunity to really

511
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
Assist drivers in make

512
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
Driving safety

513
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
Is in the area beta

514
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
As we bring

515
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
More

516
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
Computing into the car I think we're going to see this

517
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
But the car is a really good one

518
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
What needs

519
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,751
How to change about

520
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,031
How cars are made

521
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
How even car manufacturer

522
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Think about

523
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,639
Vehicles and then also

524
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,175
As a user how should I think

525
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
About my day

526
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,599
Yeah so you know it's really interesting because the user experience if we can help a driver you know I'll give you

527
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,879
One example of its kind of be

528
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,207
Extreme so you know we are one of the key semiconductor

529
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:52,607
Suppliers to BMW in the seven series which was the car of the year at the New York Auto Show

530
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,399
BMW

531
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,959
You're such a good partner that we had an investor day in

532
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,287
New York and they actually brought that car to show to our investors

533
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,359
Because of the capability we have over $300

534
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
Semiconductor content

535
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
In the BMW 7 Series

536
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:11,295
And with that the feature you can take the key fob that we manufacture by the way

537
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
You know better

538
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,623
But you can take the key fob and you could actually

539
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,720
Park the car so when you approach the parking spot if it was too close

540
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,304
She could get out of the car close the door in with the key fob

541
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
Actually pull your car in a park

542
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
Associated with

543
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:33,056
No this is just parking the simple parking spot where there's no closed doors but it also would do parallel parking impact

544
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:39,712
I had that lady I was trying to shesus with my husband can't park the car in the garage so he can use the five to be able to do that so

545
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,576
So you know what it's really about making driving safer

546
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,880
But things as simple as parking

547
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
Is a convenience

548
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:53,024
So we make all of our life easier but really the key features are being able to make it safer

549
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
Warning so if your

550
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,888
If you happen to doze off or be doing something

551
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,680
And you do across a lane

552
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
Being able to have Lane change warning

553
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:06,592
Stability where somebody stops in front of you and you don't happen to be looking to Auto stopping word

554
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616
Stops your card

555
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
So that you don't run into another car

556
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,016
So that's really the key features that were trying to be able to provide when it comes to the

557
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
So

558
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
You're talking to

559
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,672
The car maker so I think it's really interesting.

560
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,488
Most of my electronics items last

561
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,072
Baby 7 years maybe 10 if they're really amazing

562
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
And hardened

563
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
But my car

564
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
Actually last 11 years

565
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,984
Right

566
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,848
That's about the average age by the way of the US Car Fleet I think

567
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
So

568
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,688
I guess how should they be thinking about it as they add more

569
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
More advanced

570
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
About module

571
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,672
So one of the key things that we're trying to do is work with the car company so we provide the Platforms in the technology

572
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:58,816
So they can upgrade that on the Fly and actually was some of the products actually upgrade over there so for example and

573
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
Security

574
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,168
There's always hackers are always making progress and Improvement

575
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,568
So we actually are trying to develop technology we're over the air or let you know through the network

576
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:13,152
We can actually upgrade the security levels associated with

577
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,992
One of the key things in working with car companies after the

578
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,784
Hacking incidents that took place last

579
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,880
The car companies are very interested in security so we're working

580
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,464
With the car companies on a three-tiered approach to be able to make

581
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,512
The cars absolutely safer soap

582
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,584
For example will put a secure element the same device

583
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,888
As I used on your bank card

584
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,984
In conjunction with the input the LTE input into your car

585
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,544
ISO that provides that someone can't hack into

586
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Qcarbo32

587
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
Access

588
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
We can put

589
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Hi security

590
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
In conjunction with my crew

591
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:49,248
Controller so that the processing knows that any input coming in

592
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
Is actually supported

593
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,928
And actually we're the leader in NBA goal networking you know if you'll have the transceivers in the car because of all the lights

594
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Points

595
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,280
It's a were actually typing out a product later this year will but

596
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,840
The basically the same thing as a secure element

597
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
We have

598
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:09,472
Which bank cards are electronic passports in conjunction with a transceiver string vehicle networking

599
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,800
Subwoofer secure a note in the car so now you don't need that for the

600
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
Complete Car Care

601
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,128
Your electric windows you probably don't care if

602
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,688
If that's secure to keep it from being hacked

603
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,528
Your mirrors you probably don't care that Jasmine is you know

604
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,808
Prevent that from being hacked

605
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,368
But your engine control your breaking your speed

606
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,952
Those are things that you want to have control over that somebody can't hack intake

607
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,256
Are they thinking about how to

608
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,560
Speed up the development process

609
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,400
On vehicle because I know right now things are coming out on cars

610
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
Thought of

611
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,728
Really built like 4 years ago

612
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,312
Yes it is changing and one of the things that we're working with them

613
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,384
Is how to provide that information you if you look at it

614
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,784
Historically the car companies have used intermediary electronics companies now they're working with a Semiconductor Company

615
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
You still have the

616
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,856
Continental Zar Bashas

617
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,416
For example or delphi's build the product

618
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,048
Weather doing is a working with the semiconductor companies to understand that technology and then specifying that

619
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,888
To those companies so that the decision process about what they do

620
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,704
Is now a shared responsibility associated with

621
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,496
But that's really a significant change for

622
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
For the car companies

623
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,312
A lot of the car companies are putting some

624
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,664
Lead technologist in Silicon Valley so they know more about what's going out

625
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:28,064
I wanted to things that were excited about the blue box is being able to work with all the car company so they have the ability to

626
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,600
Begin to think about 8oz

627
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,136
In automated driving

628
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:35,488
Without having to have a complete architecture of a car but just having a simple

629
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,536
Experimental tool that they can use

630
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Is to be able to

631
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
Experience

632
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,912
A Dawson the efficiencies of automated driving

633
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,936
Eros on demand

634
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:50,592
Alright well let's think about smart cities because you guys are working with the Department of Transportation on the 40 million dollar Grant

635
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
Smarter cities

636
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
Trials here

637
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
Here in the US

638
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
What do you think of

639
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:02,112
You know I think it's a really a phenomenal experience so you know secretary box

640
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,952
Department of Transportation that has originated this with this

641
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,512
Were they had a grant in the rooster

642
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
I think it was like maybe 50 or 60 cities across the US that actually applied for this and the finalists were

643
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:18,240
They're so sweet five or six and they ended up with Seven Cities original

644
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
Nothing we're close enough

645
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:26,176
Could not eliminate down to the absolute by but they have seven cities that are going through this process and what

646
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:32,576
What they've done is we're working with them to be able to provide the technology to each one of these cities so that they can then structure there

647
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
Proposal

648
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,928
To Department of Transportation to be able to facilitate this now

649
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,976
In addition to the 40 million dollars

650
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:45,120
Vulcan Ventures going to Paul Allen's companies adding another 10 million out so it's actually a 50 million dollar Grant

651
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,656
The city that Wednesday is

652
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,216
So we're working with them where they can drive

653
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,520
You smarter driving so the Billet deeper

654
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,800
Buses and

655
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,640
Police cars and Transit vehicles to be able to communicate with

656
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Each other

657
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,968
So that you can prevent accidents so that you

658
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,504
Can regulate traffic

659
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,088
So that you can provide the capability associate with that but we just announced

660
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,368
What's the today

661
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
Soda partnership

662
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:12,256
We had originally we announced a couple months ago after CS with the Department of trash

663
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,048
Station we just announced

664
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,840
Expanded program with the Department

665
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,376
Transportation today

666
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,656
So we take some of these

667
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,960
Security capability and Technology

668
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
Need to wear for government documents

669
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,848
And expand the program to include that so we're now working with the cities

670
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,152
On how they can do Transit ticketing

671
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:35,552
Be able to facilitate that where they can do electronic vacation of government documents you know where the Red Sun

672
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Driver's license

673
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,600
Exactly

674
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,880
Regulations

675
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,720
So then you won't have to worry about you know the the Youth of today

676
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,304
You know we're all trying to get their fake driver's license so they can go the bars

677
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,376
If we can put a chip in it then you can at least be sure

678
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,424
It's really a driver's license

679
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,448
Continue don't have that

680
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:59,360
I know some teenagers who don't like the fact that we're proposing this but in Europe

681
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
All drivers license X

682
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,688
We have a chip so you can authenticate that

683
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
Chucky

684
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:07,552
A police officer they can actually scan that to confirm that it's a real device

685
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:12,672
You know it's not like you have the opportunity to have a fake ID

686
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
Let me ask you

687
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
2 questions about

688
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,536
Kind of smart cities in actually this relates to driving

689
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
What about standard

690
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,120
Cuz I can see a lot of cities being like

691
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Hey

692
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,032
We got this reading is even even bigger standard like we're going to use RFID to track people

693
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,848
How do you see

694
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,664
Your customers thinking about

695
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,456
The fact that people travel from place to

696
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
Things need to work sort of the

697
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,856
Yeah so that's one of the challenges that we have is

698
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,696
Is we need to be sure that we can provide the technology whatever it is so you know

699
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,768
Iconnectivity yoga all those areas you talk about with

700
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,560
Bluetooth or NFC

701
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:55,424
You know that's all connectivity capability until there are standards associated with connectivity

702
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Is positive

703
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,104
But we also have to be sure that the interoperability exist so that you know is you have a electronic wallet on your smartphone

704
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
Did it came work around the world

705
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
Night so final question

706
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
What are you most

707
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
Excited about

708
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
So you know in the next 5 years

709
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:18,976
I think we're going to see a lot of change I think the ability to make all of our Lives safe

710
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,536
By having security associated with it

711
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,840
Thank some of the examples that we talked about

712
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
But making life easier

713
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,424
It whether it's self-driving cars

714
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,704
Stability

715
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:34,336
The only carry your mobile phone around for using for banking for entry for door entry

716
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,640
No just making all her life easier

717
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
So much for coming on the show

718
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,808
Fantastic thanks for coming to her technology forum

719
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:50,208
That's all we have for you this week but join us next week on the Internet of Things podcast thanks for listening
