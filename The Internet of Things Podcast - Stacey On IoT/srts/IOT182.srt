We talked a little bit about that

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,872

Okay Kevin this show is going to be a bit of a

37
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,424
Challenge because one of our big stories

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
Is Amazon planning to release

39
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,752
At least eight new

40
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,544
Madame a powered gadgets

41
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,616
Set a reminder to everybody listening that Madame a is

42
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,664
The Amazon echos digital assist

43
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,480
So these devices include a microwave

44
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
Amplifier

45
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Dim sum in car garage

46
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,088
I expect we're going to see these

47
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,136
Pretty soon because the holiday season is

48
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
Is coming up

49
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
So we're not going to talk

50
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
Whole lot about

51
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
I want everyone to stay tuned

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
For Amazon news

53
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,328
Because if and when these come out we're going to be

54
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,864
Audit right Kevin

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
Absolutely

56
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,448
It could happen at any time you never know with Amazon

57
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,496
That's how to cut a trumpet the way you

58
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,080
Evidence I'm sorry

59
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:27,712
Okay we're going to talk about Terrace later don't worry you don't have to do that cuz I know that that's a favorite topic right there

60
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
So we can talk

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
What is actually happening

62
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:35,392
With the Amazon ecosystem that they launched this week something called

63
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,696
Madam egg gadgets toolkit

64
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
And this

65
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
This is a really kind of

66
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:45,376
I think this is actually really cool thing what this is is this lets your devices

67
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,400
Interact

68
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
With the Amazon

69
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
Echo device

70
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,496
Kevin do you want to give an example

71
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:57,152
Yeah these devices which work over Bluetooth and I say these devices meeting these are devices that will be coming people

72
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
We'll have to make these devices are add these feature

73
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
Existing device

74
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
They can

75
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
Send events

76
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,832
To an echo where they can receive

77
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,696
Information from an echo so some examples that Amazon gives because against is all

78
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
A software development

79
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
Kid it's not an actual product

80
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,536
You just go out and buy

81
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
They have like wake word to text

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,704
Frank Zappa you are Gadget could respond when it hears the Madam a wake word

83
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
So if you had

84
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
It's not great example but

85
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,104
A Bluetooth connected cuckoo clock it could pop its head out whenever

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
You say mad at me

87
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,224
So you can add some things to your house that can do other things like they even say

88
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,064
Maybe have a robot that can lip-sync Asmat America local weather

89
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
It would appear as if

90
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
The robot attacks

91
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
She saying the word

92
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,952
Odoo notifications timers and alarms on

93
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
Even music I thought the music example

94
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
What kind of cool cuz

95
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
I don't know

96
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,120
Growing up you saw these on dashboards of cars

97
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,752
Oh my gosh are you serious that's exactly

98
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,848
It's exactly about so here's what they say the music aspect of this

99
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,408
Gadget sdks coming soon you can't do this yet

100
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,992
I didn't say for example you could create visual performances with music

101
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,576
Such as a hula girl that sways her hips when songs are playing on

102
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Amazon music

103
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,648
So it's kind of extending

104
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
The

105
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,720
Echo into other devices not

106
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:19,071
For providing information per se but more for interactive thing

107
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,679
Right and it's clearly Amazon is looking at this for games

108
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,495
Probably heading into the holiday season because

109
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
They

110
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
Talk a lot about using it with

111
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Toys

112
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,847
Baby products

113
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,431
So I think this is interesting because big picture

114
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,015
We should talk about this I think I'm last week show where we said that basically

115
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
Google +

116
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Amazon

117
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,879
Ecosystem are basically the standards and iot

118
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
And from that perspective this basically gives

119
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
The echo

120
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,047
A data schema that other devices can now

121
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,351
I'll see so we can understand when

122
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Madam

123
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
Alerted it

124
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Darius

125
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
Samantha

126
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Information

127
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
Things that it can do

128
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,079
So this is a pretty powerful tool and it sounds like

129
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,407
I mean if you think about the native support for various

130
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
Devices like light bulbs

131
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
Wasn't switches

132
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
Even ovens down

133
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,599
Those are also data schemas for those devices that only work with

134
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
Madam a

135
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927
Until they're kind of building the standard out here

136
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
And is it

137
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
Great because

138
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
It's not interoperable well

139
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
No but

140
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
It is happening

141
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,167
Yeah I agree I say no it's not great that it wouldn't be interoperable

142
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,239
Between everything in the house for example

143
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
But I'd rather at least have

144
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335
A platform that has its own standard

145
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,919
Yes so that way all of the devices that work with that platform

146
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
Suggested words with Madam a

147
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
Logo and such

148
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
You know it's going to work

149
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,855
You know I think it's smart of Amazon to do this

150
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
Yeah I wish it was more open but it is what it is

151
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,975
Yeah and if I mean if you only end up with

152
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
Google Amazon

153
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
Do we still count homekit

154
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
Yeah we can have to count it

155
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
So okay

156
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
So yes

157
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
Those might end up being our

158
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
And I mean that's not

159
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Terrible it's

160
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,591
And if you're a developer Building C

161
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,711
New product it is possible to get all those three things working on a device even though it is

162
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
Really freaking hard

163
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,551
So it's better than having a degree

164
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
Every other

165
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,951
You mention that there's going to be some kid Focus product

166
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
That could work with this in fact

167
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,791
Amazon announced that later this year

168
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
The Meta make gadgets for

169
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,143
Kids would be implemented and they have four five different

170
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,495
Car makers that plans already brushed spots by while we while we are thinking

171
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
Small little robots and things but

172
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
They're making smart toothbrushes

173
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
Call Brock Bots

174
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
San Antonio

175
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
Measure motion and cents

176
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,991
It's the motion so that way and the time of kids brushing their teeth

177
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
And that could interact with

178
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
Matinee

179
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
Through this gadgets for

180
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
Kids so they

181
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,415
Like how you can make games because

182
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
You can have an Interactive

183
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
But this toothbrush

184
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
Lots of potential

185
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
I think so

186
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,095
That really excited plus you tie that to last week

187
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
Snooze that we talked about and I think was actually 2 weeks

188
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
Which was the

189
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,495
Mattamy talking to sensors

190
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
And expanding

191
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
Capability

192
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,871
To Central light sensors and sensor stuck to the SmartThings system

193
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
And we're starting to see

194
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
Some really powerful stuff

195
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
With

196
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
The

197
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
So

198
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Again

199
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Really excited

200
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,367
Don't overlook waddles the smart duck

201
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
Waddles the smart. Yes

202
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
The rubber ducky that plays music and

203
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
Talks to the echo.and

204
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
Hangs out with you and your kid

205
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
Skip

206
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
Okay I joke but man

207
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,911
When my daughter was born you guys it was

208
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
2006

209
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,495
And I want you to know that the iPhone wasn't

210
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Get out

211
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,335
Get out so I tell people

212
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:48,223
Like new moms are like oh you know at least I have my phone while my baby sleeping or nursing or whatever and I'm like

213
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
I had nothing

214
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
I didn't even have a Kindle

215
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
It was a dark time

216
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
So

217
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
It's good to be a parent

218
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Okay

219
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Peking

220
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
Of giant

221
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,815
Smart home platforms let's talk about

222
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
Google

223
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,655
I did get my new Google speaker I haven't been home

224
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
Witches

225
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,495
Tougher smart home reporter so I haven't been able to install it

226
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
But

227
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,567
Soon soon I will be as excited about it as

228
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
That's the Lenovo smart cast

229
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Yes but

230
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Their new products

231
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Allegedly

232
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
Allegedly

233
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,575
This is the week for alleged products

234
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:29,951
Let's talk about Google's I believe this is real this looks like a very legitimate

235
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Leak

236
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:37,375
We knew that Google was going to do its own smart speakers or had plans to do its own it just work with Lenovo and Jay

237
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
JBL first

238
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
Earlier this year

239
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
But a

240
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,263
Site called mysmartprice.,

241
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,079
Apparently has all the leaked information on the

242
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
Brand new coming soon

243
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Google home hub

244
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:53,759
Which is their smart speaker it's a 7-inch display I would anticipate

245
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
It will be debuting on October 9th

246
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,391
Because that is the Google Hardware event in New York

247
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
And

248
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,231
I like this in I don't like this

249
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
That's because

250
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,839
It is very similar in terms of functionality to the existing smart displays

251
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:14,239
However Stacy you have a camera on your Lenovo smart display along a little privacy shutter and you use that

252
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Duo calls

253
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
Surprisingly

254
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
There is no camera

255
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
On this

256
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
This device this device is like a 7in

257
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
Tablet in landscape mode

258
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
It's patch the back of a

259
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Speaker Bass

260
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,831
Which the speaker bass looks much bigger than what's currently available from the other smart

261
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
This place

262
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,183
That's good but I'm shocked ordino Duo support no

263
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,999
Camera that maybe because this is a landscape only device

264
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
You know I also think it might be

265
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
Might be smart because

266
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,471
People are a little iffy about Google it right at this particular moment in

267
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
In time

268
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,543
There's even remember the location drama

269
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Oh yeah

270
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,919
Ghetto in more so than Amazon which has a business model that we

271
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
Tend to think we understand

272
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Which you like

273
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
They sell us stuff

274
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
That's their business

275
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,087
Google is still they have this kind of weird

276
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Add

277
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,695
Director of data broker is what they are

278
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
Yeah so I can

279
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,303
See why there might be a little hesitant on this Plus

280
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
Harley lowers

281
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
The cost a little bit

282
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,423
Good and they also have

283
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,751
Maybe it makes sense cuz you're not cannibalizing their other of their partner

284
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:24,383
But that's the funny part of it it's almost like hey people don't trust us with data so

285
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,431
We're going to be a little more private up the camera

286
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
But he Partners you go ahead and put your

287
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
September 2nd

288
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
That is

289
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
It's kind of funny but whatever

290
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,903
So everything that you're

291
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
Smart display

292
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
But you haven't had chance to use yet

293
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Can do

294
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
This will do so you can

295
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
Stream music

296
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
Chromecast receiver

297
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,423
You can watch YouTube videos on it you can use the Google Assistant

298
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
Controlling your home getting information

299
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
Etc and you have the display for all that time

300
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Screen display

301
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
So everything we talked about with the

302
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
LG Smart display

303
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
You can

304
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
Do

305
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
Here's the thing

306
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Here's the thing

307
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
The rumor

308
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Is

309
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
149

310
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,111
Which is cheaper than the smart display even the 8in

311
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
So that's

312
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Good

313
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
Here's the thing that I said I was kind of not excited about

314
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
I said back in March

315
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
Time for Google to make a smart home hub

316
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
And this only supports

317
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,447
2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth

318
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
So I will

319
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,775
Have liked to seen zubeen

320
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,079
Seaway videos in a product like

321
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
Or even even

322
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
Make it a Google Wi-Fi router

323
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
As well.

324
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
I don't see any indication of that

325
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
This just feels like I'm

326
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,087
Missed opportunity but maybe I'm too needy I don't know

327
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
Man you are so focused you

328
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Kevin you're like

329
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
Having dreams of

330
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Yes so

331
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,047
You got that straight you like I hate her

332
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,119
But I want a hub

333
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
The issue here

334
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
And this is a big challenge in

335
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,543
The smart home is for most products that people are buying today

336
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
The one-off

337
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,615
Products there like I needed

338
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Hubs

339
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
What you want is it be in Z-Wave

340
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
Which makes sense

341
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,295
But those are sensor-based products those are for things

342
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
Light switches and all kinds

343
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,159
For the most part the only thing we don't really have

344
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,183
Great stuff in

345
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
In the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth world

346
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Is sensor

347
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
Because you have Wi-Fi

348
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Is battery hog

349
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Bluetooth mesh

350
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
Took a while coming and

351
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,447
And it's starting so we might see some Bluetooth sensors that are really capable

352
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
But for now

353
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
That's what

354
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
And I think that'll actually

355
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Relatively

356
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
And if it does I'll be okay

357
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
I'll be okay

358
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,575
I told about me obviously it's all about it

359
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,135
You know something really cool stuff requires

360
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
And

361
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
Yeah so I know you

362
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
I know you hate the

363
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
There's a really good reason they're not out there

364
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:54,911
If everyone started clamoring for sensors and wanted to really like deeply program their smart home I think we get there

365
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
But until then

366
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
I don't think

367
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,823
And I should say that you're going to be at this event so

368
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,383
The podcast coming out the week of the Google News

369
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
Kevin will have been there

370
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
He'll give us all his

371
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Also

372
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
Speaking of Google

373
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
Little step for you

374
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
The Google home Mini

375
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
What's the best selling

376
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,743
Turn speaker into tube was it really sold or was it just packaged along with every single device I felt like

377
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,447
I don't know why it's really it's shipments not sales this is a report from strategy Analytics

378
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,543
At a pretty good regardless of the word they use sales or shipment

379
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
They say in the second quarter

380
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
That

381
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,223
The Google home have 2.3 million Global shipments compared to the echo Dot

382
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Stupid

383
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Tonight

384
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
Pretty darn close but

385
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
I think

386
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,647
This may be the first time that has happened

387
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Ask could will be

388
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
I don't know

389
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
I think it's the first time

390
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
And speaking of all of this

391
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
Especially the housing

392
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,311
I should say because I wrote about it for the newsletter but if you don't read the newsletter

393
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
Which is okay

394
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
You only listen to us

395
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,663
I had an Amazon smart person

396
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
Coming to my house

397
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,223
House and set it to rights

398
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,039
Guess you paid 50 bucks for that

399
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,343
I think it's 4995 and I had a

400
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Lovely gentleman

401
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
Who's actually employed by Amazon

402
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
Show up at my house

403
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
Cost for a hour-long comp

404
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
Application

405
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
And

406
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
Some people ask they were like

407
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
Did you do it just to show him up at

408
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,423
I was like I did not I really want it I had some problems with

409
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
My implementation

410
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Defects in

411
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
Let me tell you guys

412
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
This fellow knew

413
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:43,199
What he was talking about he walks in he's like wow you already have a lot of stuff like within 2 minutes of my home yet identified like all

414
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
All of these brands of products

415
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,807
Even identify my Logitech Harmony Hub just a little IR

416
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,599
Receiver that was stuck on top of the cab

417
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
And just to be clear

418
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
He did not know

419
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,511
Who you were that you do this show or anything like that you

420
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
Winter the typical customer process

421
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
Yes

422
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
I did while he was there

423
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Tell him

424
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
You know cuz he was like

425
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,703
You really have a lot of stuff and I'm like

426
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,239
I do this for a living I

427
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Gadgets for

428
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
And I'm not mentioning his name

429
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
There was absolutely nothing wrong with the experience

430
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Set there had been

431
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
Talked about it before we talked

432
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
But

433
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
I will say

434
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,319
He was prepared to install he was

435
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:24,159
Prepared to give me advice on which things to buy what we ended up doing because

436
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
We have a lot of things

437
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Installed

438
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
Is we ended up

439
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,327
Focusing on programming a few

440
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Because I find it so too

441
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,519
I like I'll make him do the boring stuff and maybe I'll have ideas for things I can include

442
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
So

443
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,591
We also talked about my naming a

444
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,127
So I have

445
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,175
A lot of devices and sometimes

446
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
When I asked

447
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
The echo to turn something on or off

448
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
Madame Abel be like

449
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
Which device did you mean

450
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
And I have to say it again

451
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,695
So his advice to me was actually to name everything that was in my living room

452
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
Living room light fun

453
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
Living room light 2

454
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,559
Living room lights for the group

455
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
And

456
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
Living room blinds

457
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
Sitting room fan

458
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
All of these things

459
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,799
Is that actually for some reason help I have been trying to come up with creative names for everything

460
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,591
Because it seemed easier with

461
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,871
Other systems

462
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,663
But I just kind of acquiesced

463
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
He did say

464
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
Couple things I didn't realize you could add for

465
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,599
Teens if you create a grouping of Lights you can just add the group into the

466
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
So you don't have to add the light

467
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Italy witch

468
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,463
Helpful if everyone else do that

469
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Good on that but I didn't

470
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
And I was like who

471
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Thank you

472
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
And then the other thing

473
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:40,447
He told me is if I could if I wanted to name things only in The Madam a app

474
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
If I didn't want

475
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,567
To do it like my Lutron lights for example like either name them in the Lutron app

476
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,359
And then those would populate because

477
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
Is my Lutron hub

478
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
Shares data with

479
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
Madam

480
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,479
With Siri and

481
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
With Google

482
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,831
Or I could just change the names in Madam hey if I didn't

483
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
Want to mess up

484
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
The names in the other two

485
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
This is important

486
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Because

487
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
For a while

488
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Google

489
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,071
Really hated it that I named everything in the living

490
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
I personally do not want

491
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
Different names for everything in each differ

492
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
Ecosystem

493
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
So I'm still

494
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
Dealing with the frustration of certain

495
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
Systems like

496
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
Different naming

497
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,127
Procedures butt

498
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
You know if your

499
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
Really organized and you want you

500
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
Devices to basically have three different names

501
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
You could

502
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,599
So is this available for pretty much anybody wants to

503
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:34,719
To call Amazon and say Hey I want somebody come to my house or 49 bucks or whatever it is

504
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,279
Help me get started or whatever

505
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
So I'm not sure

506
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,887
It came up as an option in my Amazon

507
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,679
Because they're an employee

508
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
Of Amazon

509
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,007
My hunch is if you're out in the middle of nowhere

510
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Maybe not

511
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
But I bet

512
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
You could find it

513
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
You're near major city

514
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,407
Right I probably could do it

515
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
I don't know that I will but

516
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,735
It sounds like you had a pretty good experience

517
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
And

518
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
Like would you recommend this

519
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
For somebody who's Brand New

520
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,391
That's like the typical question and get right

521
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:08,767
You know I don't know where to start but I know what I want I don't know what I want to do I don't know what I want to have but I want us tomorrow

522
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
So would this be good for those people

523
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
Yes

524
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,607
He would be

525
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
This one guy

526
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
Just this one guy I mean I'm assuming and I should tell you he was a genius before he was so it Apple Genius before he work for

527
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
He did

528
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
The Border

529
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,431
Where the Rubicon

530
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Not sure which one

531
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,271
So this particular individual

532
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,599
I feel confident saying that if you called this person to your house

533
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
That he would be able to help you

534
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,487
Setting stuff up he actually gently prompted me for he's like

535
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
What can I see in July

536
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Do you want

537
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,863
Let's do movie time and have a conversation

538
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:50,751
And I explained what I was after he's like oh yeah that's really cool okay and then he actually even Mesa

539
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
Superlative suggestions

540
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
Based on the prices I had

541
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
And

542
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,639
He suggests he looked around he's like

543
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,455
Oh the Lutron light I love those actually recommend those

544
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Everybody

545
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,295
And you know he liked the wink Hub he liked the ledge.

546
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Lake Harmony

547
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,879
He did not force me to buy a Fire TV infrared

548
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Cute saying

549
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,255
So overall I would say it was a really good experience even

550
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
Bless his heart tried to help me find

551
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
A Smart Lock

552
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
For my front door

553
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Impossible

554
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
Because of the Locking

555
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,727
Because he was like already he was gung-ho ready to try it

556
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
I text you if I find

557
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,175
If he find something he's now going to be elevated till I coyote hero but

558
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
Pradel

559
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,247
I got really positive experience

560
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
$50

561
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
For an hour of this person

562
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:40,159
Time you if you didn't feel comfortable installing you probably have to do it at least two

563
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,743
Because you would want this person and there's additional installation piece

564
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
But coming out and saying

565
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,375
Oh this is your life will to hear some ideas that might work for you

566
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
And here's the products

567
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
You should buy

568
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Or I think

569
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,519
You should buy and I think you would actually have a good

570
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Experience

571
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
Okay hey

572
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,383
Let's talk about utilities Kevin

573
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
Woohoo

574
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,247
Yeah let's do that with Telstra

575
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,319
Right so Telstra down in Australia

576
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Which has now

577
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
2

578
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,135
Iot Networks

579
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
So they have a

580
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,463
NB iot Network as well as a cat

581
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
M

582
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,791
Network they have hooked up with

583
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,607
Some major water utilities down there we don't know which one

584
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,423
But basically this will allow the water utilities

585
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,727
To track and monitor water usage

586
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Conservation

587
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
Netty leak

588
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:32,639
Etc said something that you as a consumer going to use but maybe it's offered through your utility

589
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:37,503
Nowthis uses their NB iot Network which covers 3.5

590
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
Million square kilometers down there

591
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,831
And

592
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
They do have

593
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,903
As I said the cat m

594
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,743
Network as well but they're not using for this and that's because of the amount of data

595
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,559
They're two networks depending on what it is you want

596
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
To do

597
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,143
With our team one is better suited than the other

598
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,983
I was just going to remind people nb-iot

599
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,263
Cat M1

600
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
Up to

601
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,359
Megabit per second of data so you can do a little bit more

602
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Exactly

603
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Isolate for instance

604
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,479
The water services don't need a ton of

605
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,831
But Telstra does sell three different

606
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855
Tracking devices

607
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,672
Slap need more bandwidth and therefore

608
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
They use the cat M1 Network

609
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
Yay

610
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,280
And in other

611
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
Exciting

612
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,328
Exciting news

613
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
After the utilities is

614
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
Insurance

615
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
So

616
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,704
A company called a hippo insurance

617
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
Is

618
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,520
Doing a deal with a company called no show

619
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
And I've written about notion they make these

620
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
Discs

621
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
Is the best

622
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
Hockey they're not hockey

623
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,456
Not that our sensors they have

624
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,504
Temperature humidity water leak

625
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
Lot of information motion

626
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,576
Very easy to use

627
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,112
So hippo has done

628
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,392
A deal with notion

629
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,928
To give new hippo cast

630
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,464
Samaritan qualifying States

631
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
A notion smart home starter kit

632
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
When they sign up for an insurance policy

633
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
This is like

634
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,632
About their time and be

635
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,192
Could have what we talked about for a while

636
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,728
Which is trying to

637
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,288
Get insurance companies to subsidize

638
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,848
What is kind of a high price for a lot of smart home devices

639
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
Does people feel

640
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,176
Water leak sensors

641
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,992
Kind of pricey I'd rather do something cool like a color-changing bulb

642
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
Or nothing

643
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,552
That's probably the more common thing

644
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
Things to say

645
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,440
But this is you know your insurance providers helping you out with this kid and

646
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,024
It is also created a policy that integrates the information

647
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
From this

648
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,704
It's also the first policy to integrate this information into their pricing so what will happen is not only do you like a lot

649
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
Like a 5% discount if you

650
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
Add like a security system

651
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
Things like that

652
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,848
This they're basically

653
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,664
Lowering the cost as long as you have this kit

654
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
Installed

655
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
And I think it'll be great to see what kind of data

656
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
They get from that

657
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,368
So it's an exciting deal I would keep an eye on it because

658
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
If this I think

659
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
Actually is

660
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
The future

661
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
Okay moving right along

662
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
What about standards

663
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
Iot security standard

664
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,144
Are we excited yet

665
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:08,544
Going from utilities to standards I don't know in the world I don't know so Sprint has launched

666
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,824
What it's

667
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
Calling

668
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,408
The Curiosity iot platform

669
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,992
Oh I kind of made fun of this when it came out

670
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,296
Cuz who needs another iot platform

671
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
But here we are

672
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,856
With yet another one

673
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,184
This one has a lot of moving parts so it's not just

674
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Sprint order

675
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
Sprint

676
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,256
Portsmouth SoftBank

677
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
Who

678
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
Now owns arm

679
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,632
Yeah so there's the

680
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,936
Arm for connectivity management and

681
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,216
Sim Solutions

682
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Dislike for provisioning

683
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,800
Cellular devices with iot

684
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,104
As well as something called

685
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,504
Packets another SoftBank company softbank's really smart they're taking the buying all these other companies that are in the space

686
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
And then just

687
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,368
Putting together Thomas like being a smart venture capitalist you know using your own

688
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,648
Investment companies

689
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,928
Put things together

690
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
But packet

691
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
Enables an advanced Network

692
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,048
With bare metal servers at the edge

693
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,584
Watch that can be activated in minutes

694
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
Going to Sprint

695
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:10,752
Yeah and so the bare metal servers are important because the underlying feature here is basic

696
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,312
That you control your Edge Network

697
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Yourself

698
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:18,688
As a customer and that means you can put your own containers or virtualize it

699
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:24,576
However you want it also means that you can reduce latency because you're going to run everything at the edge

700
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,928
This is okay right now the network for it is going to be LTE and Cat m

701
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
There

702
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,000
They're very excited seeing 5G is coming

703
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,792
Isn't everybody excited by that

704
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
Yes I'm like

705
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:40,448
But let's see other things that are good they thought about power consumption

706
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,520
Which is good they allow you to run this with different operators and different

707
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,312
Countries which is good for you know if your

708
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,104
Monitoring things to travel around

709
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
The world and

710
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,176
Their plan is to launch it

711
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,016
In eight areas in November 14th of February and then

712
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,552
150 + 29

713
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:01,952
Team so that's the Curiosity core they also have an operating system that ties into this and handles

714
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488
Device and data management all that

715
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,280
Fun stuff that every iot platform

716
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,864
Have anime have on top of that with their call coyotes

717
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
Solutions

718
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
These are actually pretty

719
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Packaged

720
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,752
Clusters of features for things like vehicle and Fleet Management

721
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,288
Or personal safety

722
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
And smart cities

723
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,384
But some of these are

724
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
Really aimed it like

725
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:26,016
Companies that don't want to have to do all this integration work and build everything

726
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
And that makes sense because you can

727
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:35,232
The platform out there but if nobody wants to do the world to use it it's not going to go anywhere so by targeting different verticals use cases

728
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
Isn't providing a

729
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:41,120
Place to start Sara speak or even a whole Solution that's how you're going to get

730
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,144
Customers

731
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,240
Anne-Marie to see if that it will see I mean the devil's in the details on these so we'll see

732
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,288
How Wellspring to straddle the line between

733
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
Customized enough

734
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,336
And

735
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
Flexibility

736
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,384
Which is everybody

737
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:57,504
So again nice package will see if people are going to use it

738
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,344
I feel like there's a lot out there but this could give someone a run for their money

739
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
Alright next up

740
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
Is

741
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,952
BlackBerry

742
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,536
And I'm surprised it took blackberry's so long to really

743
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:15,936
Get into the iot space but that's what they're doing. They been in there for a while remember cute

744
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,776
Way back in 28 12 2011

745
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,336
They were touting q and x which is an embedded

746
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,872
System software development

747
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,176
As something appropriate for iot

748
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,480
It really wasn't because it didn't have like a

749
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
Jeffrey Artis

750
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,784
Yeah qnx was

751
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
It still is heavily

752
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
In Automotive

753
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,648
Fur entertainment systems and such

754
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
And I think they want to leverage infected

755
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,744
Tried to once with their BlackBerry PlayBook

756
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
Tablet that went nowhere

757
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
So yeah

758
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,352
You're right I guess you could say they tried to

759
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,680
Pivot qnx into something that it really wasn't but

760
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,728
It's okay cuz now they have Blackberry Spark

761
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Exactly

762
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Kevin

763
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
What is black

764
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,104
So this is their plan

765
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,504
Top form for it security so it like for example it could cut off a devices connectivity

766
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,320
Send location when deciding on a risk factor

767
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,136
It has unified endpoint management so

768
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,976
That is part of the deployment and updating for devices also notification

769
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
Social Security threats

770
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
And

771
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,584
Oh I wasn't saying that that's about it however

772
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,168
They also are including something or calling London Shield

773
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
And this

774
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960
Will

775
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
Use the data from the system

776
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,056
This could be some people may not like this

777
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
It will

778
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:30,176
Take data from businesses and people that use this technology and use it

779
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,224
Train the AI software

780
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
In spark

781
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,832
And therefore the more secure organizations individuals will be at home

782
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
People use it and that makes

783
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,696
Sent him a technical standpoint but I wonder if anybody's going to be concerned about

784
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,488
Privacy on these iot devices

785
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,024
Well if it's just this

786
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,376
Security threats incursions that's actually something that a lot of

787
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,936
Security companies actually offer today

788
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
A pull that data in and

789
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,520
Then train their bottles and send out

790
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,592
They're paid him for the latest threats and then we also have like

791
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
Their groups you

792
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
Send your

793
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,664
Threat information

794
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
Take a pilot

795
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
Panda sounds like that

796
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,320
I don't know there's not a lot of details on London

797
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,624
Okay well we'll wait

798
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,392
Find out for

799
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
And in the meantime

800
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
It's time to

801

To talk about

802
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,512
Our question of the day

803
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
Rather

Very nice

821
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
Is that a tie

822
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,936
Remember smarter homes start with

823
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
Play

824
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
Okay so this week

825
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
We have

826
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
Hazard question

827
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,080
Voicemail from Alistair

828
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:08,992
Hey Stacy it's Alice to hear from Sydney Australia I'm a long time listener and I'm looking for a solution

829
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
For a

830
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,064
Adobada and remote into come

831
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,856
For my apartment that I live in

832
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,392
I have a current you to come

833
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,208
System by scr Electronics

834
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,768
And look around at a few Solutions

835
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
Like Melo and

836
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
Monkey

837
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:29,472
But just wanted to know your thoughts and if you had any solutions that's I guess would work better or if there was any kind of

838
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,752
Solution

839
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,544
That would be great thanks for not much

840
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,640
LOL Alistar about a year ago someone else had this exact

841
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,176
Same question for me

842
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,712
And they too were looking at

843
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
Nelo

844
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,528
And just so you know the monkey

845
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,880
Popcorn that you're taking out actually became mellow hits started as a Kickstarter for monkey

846
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
And now it is

847
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
Hello

848
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
Really trying say the word mellow

849
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
Okay

850
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,512
So what this is

851
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,584
This is a speaker that you pop on the intercom

852
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,864
Button area in

853
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
Your apartment

854
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
And

855
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
Yes your existing

856
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,728
And it's inside your apartment

857
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,312
And it basically it communicates with the electrical signals

858
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,848
That are happening so you can

859
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,152
Talk to the person at the door if

860
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,432
Want to and

861
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
You can also

862
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,248
Send a signal to open the

863
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,064
Now that's all well and good

864
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
If you want them to come

865
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,368
All the way up into your

866
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,392
Apartment though

867
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,952
After you post them in you're going to need a Smart Lock

868
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
On your door

869
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
And you're going to have to

870
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
Open that

871
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,304
So that's kind of how that

872
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
Works

873
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,608
Danella website

874
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
If you know your intercom Baker they

875
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Give you

876
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,216
Compatibility information

877
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,752
They seem pretty compatible slots

878
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,312
Announce have a 30-day money-back

879
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,080
Guarantee

880
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
So if it doesn't work you

881
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,480
I don't know how hard it is to install I don't have this problem so I haven't tried this device

882
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,272
Based on the Nilla website

883
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,064
It doesn't seem too difficult to install

884
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,904
Stop it literally connecting to your existing intercom

885
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
System in your apartment,

886
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,488
And therefore it's not any

887
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,280
Drilling ordering like that

888
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,560
You literally

889
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
Canada

890
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,608
Connected via jumpers

891
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,144
To your existing intercom so

892
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,544
System and when you're done when you move in that complex you can actually unwire and take it with you so it doesn't seem so

893
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,336
So bad but it's going to be late

894
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,360
500 euros

895
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Back

896
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
That's a lot of money

897
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,712
But if you never want to get off the couch

898
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,248
It might be worth it

899
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
True

900
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
A lot of money

901
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,392
No I mean there are people with like mobility issues

902
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,952
Or you don't do parents

903
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,488
You got a baby in one hand

904
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,024
Amazon Echo in another

905
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,584
This is high drama

906
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,656
Waddle the Ducks running around I mean let it slide

907
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,496
So yeah Alistair that seems to be the best option and

908
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,800
The nice thing is it doesn't require your landlord

909
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,336
Cuz I was thinking of

910
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,384
Nest doorbell out there type

911
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
Black butt

912
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
Then you got to talk to your dorm in a lot of

913
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,736
Apartments have

914
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,552
That's actually another thing depending on your apartment

915
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,600
Depending on your country's regulations

916
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,160
You may not be able to install a Smart Lock on Europe

917
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
Apartment because there rules about

918
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,488
Someone having a master key

919
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
Need to give emergency

920
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Personal workers

921
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,816
In cases of fire in

922
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,864
That sort of thing so just be aware

923
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
Of that

924
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Good point

925
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
But you could at least get the Buzzard

926
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Okay

927
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
Or you can actually do that not worried about fires

928
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
Your call

929
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
It's up to you

930
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
Okay

931
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,272
So if you have a question or you would like to enter to win

932
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,832
Can a Schlage sense smart deadbolt wifi adapter

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
Answer your question

936
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
All right

937
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:36,864
It is time to move on to our guest this week's guest is Kim Kelly the CEO of Hampton products

938
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,936
And he's going to talk about a new Wi-Fi powered

939
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,728
Smart Lock that they

940
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,312
Last week the impact of tariffs

941
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,360
On iot devices

942
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
Other consumer devices

943
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,176
This is big news

944
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,712
In the World At Large so

945
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
And now

946
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
A word from our sponsor

947
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:02,720
Hey everyone we are taking a break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor

948
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,744
Where is Basque

949
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,096
And I have json man who is VP of iot it's at

950
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,120
Ask you to talk to us

951
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,680
In the last few weeks we talked about sass

952
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,704
Edge computing

953
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,752
And what it's doing with iot

954
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
This week we're going to talk about the iot

955
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
Partner ecosystem you guys are

956
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,384
Can you tell us a little bit of

957
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,432
Jordans the critical element

958
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,456
And I empty space

959
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,736
The fact is there most

960
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:25,760
Components that are

961
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,296
Required to bring together two

962
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,832
Complete the total solution

963
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,600
Infor customers

964
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
If you think about the accident

965
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,184
Played

966
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Locomotive

967
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
Or turbine

968
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
Or windmills

969
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
Abscess

970
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,840
Some cells that are generating the data with all of the

971
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
Appointments around

972
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,656
There's a storage Networks

973
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,472
Weatherby cloud or crimmins the network itself

974
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
In the Methodist

975
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,008
The transport

976
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,544
The data and there's so many variations

977
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
Snare from

978
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,336
Satellite

979
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,128
Will power win Networks

980
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:52,896
5G

981
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
Xiaomi next

982
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
Matisse is certainly critical

983
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,736
And we think certainly an important

984
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,272
Component of that is analytic

985
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
So we really feel like

986
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,344
These ecosystems have

987
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,160
Define tested verified for

988
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,928
A total salon

989
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:10,304
Where do you see the examples of this ecosystem approach

990
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
Helping customers get better

991
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,144
Results so you do see it across

992
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,680
Industry what are folks

993
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,216
Just identified

994
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,496
These industry clouds

995
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
Partners that are in the

996
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
Space coyote

997
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Key platforms

998
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,104
Non example and then work

999
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,664
Put them to plug Sasson as he Analytics

1000
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,224
Choice a great example of that is important

1001
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
We have with g

1002
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
Transportation

1003
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,296
And their ads

1004
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
Offering

1005
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,600
Where SAS is

1006
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
Embedded

1007
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136
And their device

1008
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,416
In this case those devices

1009
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,744
Deployed locomotives but they can be deployed to any high top

1010
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
Last. End

1011
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,792
Helpful

1012
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,328
What's processing at the edge

1013
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,864
And the prep for data is

1014
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Get back into

1015
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,168
The server found

1016
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,984
So that's one example where we're seeing Great Sea

1017
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
Success with helping

1018
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
Dwell time

1019
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,824
Holly sociated

1020
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,592
Fuel burn

1021
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
An early in the

1022
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Indication of

1023
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,152
Central failures.

1024
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
The Operators

1025
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,224
And it sounds like when you're dealing with

1026
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
Lots of Partners

1027
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,296
In the iot we are that

1028
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
Openness

1029
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
This is really a big

1030
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
How do you guys a

1031
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,184
Dress that it certainly is Bears wide Market adopt

1032
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,232
What we have to be

1033
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
Be sure of is that we're not

1034
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
Displacement technology

1035
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
Around Latin invest

1036
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
Center Channel partners

1037
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,656
Or operators have

1038
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
What some of the open

1039
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,704
Resource capability

1040
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,984
How use Python path

1041
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
Example

1042
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,544
BYU Sadat with respect

1043
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,872
Creating models what we do find is that there is an issue with

1044
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,152
With being able to transition

1045
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,176
Modeling language

1046
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,456
Into operation

1047
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
Employment where

1048
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,272
Do you have Enterprise scale in

1049
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
Sustainment

1050
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,320
Being a primary object

1051
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,344
And we try to help

1052
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
Xplatform

1053
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
As a basis

1054
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,440
This for that token

1055
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
Value

1056
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,304
Excellent where can we go to find out more about SAS

1057
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,680
The best place for iot information in our ecosystem

1058
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,704
We found golang

1059
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
Chess.com

1060
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,344
Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

1061
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,184
Is Kim Kelly the CEO of Hampton products

1062
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,976
Hi Kim how are you doing today

1063
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
I'm great Stacy how are you

1064
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,560
Superb

1065
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,864
And I am excited to talk to you because

1066
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888
Just this month

1067
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
You guys launched a

1068
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,704
Ran

1069
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,984
Connect a lock on them

1070
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,312
And it's kind of different than most connected

1071
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,128
So we're going to talk about that but first

1072
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,408
Let's level set with

1073
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,200
Hampton products International

1074
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,224
What is that

1075
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:41,856
Canton was established to create a security Hardware platform

1076
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,392
Initially and padlocks

1077
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Portable security

1078
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
We call it now

1079
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,768
And we knew that over time we would be able to create Barry

1080
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,792
Innovative

1081
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,840
Branded security Hardware

1082
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,144
Not only in padlocks button door locks in

1083
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,936
Security Hardware in electronics

1084
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
No one at that point

1085
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,240
Forshaw

1086
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
The Advent of iron

1087
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,312
Chase and The Internet of Things

1088
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:06,176
But that has given us a real opportunity to create some very distinctive

1089
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
Security Hardware products

1090
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,504
Underboss the Brinks

1091
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,296
And the Hampton brand name

1092
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,600
So we did launch Deer Point last

1093
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:19,744
Thursday we announce that the array deadbolt would begin shipping on or about October 1st to Consumers

1094
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,792
And we're really excited about that lawn

1095
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,096
Okay when I saw the lock I was

1096
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,144
Most impressed by the fact that it uses

1097
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,912
Wi-Fi

1098
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
And it has

1099
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704
Solar panels

1100
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,496
It so it can charge if it's outdoors

1101
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,288
Obviously not if you installed this

1102
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
Patrick Rodgers

1103
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,384
Why go with Wi-Fi Bluetooth

1104
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
Some of the other

1105
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
Technologies out there

1106
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:42,784
2010 when we started this what has become an odyssey and we designed

1107
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,600
Connected home platform we knew that consumers

1108
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,648
Told us that they wanted to start with the deadbolt

1109
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,232
They call that kind of a handshake as you're going into the house

1110
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,536
And so for years ago weed

1111
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,816
Cat outline

1112
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,608
The structure of

1113
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:03,008
The way this deadbolt should be built and as we interviewed consumers and we talked to lots of people in the iot world

1114
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
They all said

1115
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:10,176
If there's a way for you to do this without creating a hot or a Gateway and it could just connect directly to the home router

1116
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944
That would be awesome

1117
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,248
What we knew would be a challenge

1118
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:20,672
Most people in residential loan don't have power to the front door so we knew we'd have to come up with a really robust battery

1119
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,720
Software configuration that would

1120
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,280
Extend battery life behind just a couple of weeks

1121
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,560
Over the last 4 years

1122
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,096
By combining the solar

1123
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,680
Technology with some really Innovative battery and circuitry

1124
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,704
Technologies

1125
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,264
We've been able to create a platform where

1126
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
Is this lock is in

1127
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Installed in your phone

1128
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,128
Contour you make that up to seven eight or nine months

1129
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,176
Battery life out of a

1130
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
A single battery

1131
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,992
If you get indirect sunlight

1132
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:49,344
Your 90 days and if it's installed in your garage to your point

1133
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,904
Then it's going to be probably 30 days max

1134
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,952
So to account for that

1135
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,744
We elected ultimately to put

1136
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
2

1137
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:02,912
5200 milliamp batteries in each package so that the consumer can keep one battery fully charged

1138
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
When they

1139
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:08,032
Array app tells you that your battery is down to maybe 10% life left

1140
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:13,152
Then you can pull it out and put in your second battery in that process takes about 5 Seconds

1141
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
With this locket

1142
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:18,016
MSRP used

1143
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,064
Compared to some of the other locks

1144
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,880
The closest is going to be the nest by Yale lock

1145
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
Its 2:40

1146
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,208
Are you concerned that you're coming in high

1147
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:26,976
In this market

1148
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:33,632
We really have challenge ourselves in her thinking about the value and originally our Target price was to be between 249

1149
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
259

1150
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,936
To build in

1151
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,472
The solar technology and

1152
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:43,104
Give consumers to $50 suggested retail price batteries in a single package

1153
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,896
Forced us to take the

1154
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,736
Suggested retail price to 299 initially expecting like a

1155
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
Every consumer product

1156
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:50,784
In the

1157
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,184
Field that over time we're going to be able to squeeze cost out and check right now we're working on a new prove battery

1158
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,584
Allergy and to your point of Non Solo version that could be installed in the garage with Superior battery life and clearly a

1159
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,168
Lower price because we wouldn't have the solar technology built into the lot

1160
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:10,240
So yes I think it's relatively high price

1161
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:14,080
Very premium products going in it's a great to deadbolts

1162
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:20,480
Which will mean something to a locksmith and consumer some consumers a lot too

1163
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:23,552
Customers who insist on a real high-quality deadbolt product

1164
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,856
The foundation for these iot devices

1165
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
But over time we do expect

1166
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,928
Text that it would be able to be

1167
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,024
Reduced in cost that it would still connect directly to the consumer

1168
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,072
Router near home Wi-Fi

1169
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:39,680
And that battery life could be extended as the Technologies continue to improve

1170
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,520
The focus of the show isn't actually on the product but I did want to talk about it

1171
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
What you do

1172
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
And

1173
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,128
What I really wanted to talk to you

1174
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,688
To about his something that's actually on our minds this week

1175
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,712
Because

1176
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,760
It's happening again is Terrace

1177
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,040
And this weekend

1178
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
The Trump Administration

1179
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856
Said they might

1180
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,416
Actually go forward with another round of tariffs

1181
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,720
Roughly 200 billion dollars worth of

1182
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,744
Chinese Goods

1183
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,072
A lot of these are going to hit the Consumer Electronics

1184
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,376
So I'm very curious

1185
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,656
About your take

1186
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
So Pro tariff

1187
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Or not protest

1188
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,336
Well mostly I'm in favor as I think the administration is

1189
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,872
Of a Level Playing Field

1190
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,152
And for sure

1191
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,968
Coming into the United States and moving into China

1192
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,296
The playing field isn't level across all categories

1193
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,344
Witness racing has focused on

1194
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
At this point in the additional

1195
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,184
200 billion dollars worth of

1196
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,512
China Imports into the United States as you pointed out

1197
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
And I think any change

1198
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,328
Interest

1199
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,144
He's going to significantly impact most us busy

1200
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,704
This proposal will impact

1201
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,472
Thousands of

1202
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,008
Businesses in the United States

1203
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:50,848
If we didn't do anything and simply absorb the tariffs

1204
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,407
And we're unable to pass our pricing long

1205
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943
It would put our company out of this

1206
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,247
So I'm going to guess that there

1207
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,271
A number of

1208
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
Unknown

1209
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,343
An unintended consequences

1210
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,647
That would be associated with this move

1211
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:08,767
For sure most companies in our industry are going to be impacted by this proposed next round of tariffs

1212
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,559
But you understand the impact

1213
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,839
Or the background

1214
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,631
You really have to understand

1215
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:17,471
What consumers in the United States have grown to expect and what retailers

1216
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,031
Have gone out of their way to be able to provide for them

1217
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
The retailers

1218
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,079
Feel that there's

1219
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
Appropriately

1220
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,663
An obligation for them to give consumers the

1221
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,687
The best value

1222
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,735
On each one of the products that they offer

1223
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,295
So that is the highest quality products

1224
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,575
The best price

1225
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,879
And to ensure that in a global market

1226
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
The retailer

1227
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:41,279
Jet that value they hold line reviews virtually every year and every product

1228
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,351
Hampton has spent 27 years

1229
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,887
In Southeast Asia

1230
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,167
Principally in China

1231
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:49,471
Making sure that we could provide the

1232
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,751
The best value

1233
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
To our customers

1234
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
And then on to

1235
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
There

1236
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,895
Consumers so that we remain competitive

1237
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,687
That we're going through a process of

1238
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,711
Continuous Improvement

1239
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,247
And that were able to meet

1240
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,319
Our customers and their consumers expectations

1241
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,879
That makes sense I do love buying things for cheap

1242
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,695
So let's talk about your history

1243
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,231
With Chinese Manufacturing

1244
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:11,999
Because

1245
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,303
Obviously this company has been around for a while

1246
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,351
And where is it manufactured

1247
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
Its products

1248
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:23,775
When we bought the Old Hampton Lock Company back in 1990 would actually did have any 85% ownership in a small

1249
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,335
Allied manufacturing concern in Taiwan

1250
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,615
Shortly after that

1251
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,407
Because I have been going to church

1252
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
3 years

1253
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,991
We ended up moving most of the manufacturer

1254
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
Bring into China

1255
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:37,343
Because we found in one case that there was generations of

1256
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,439
Experience making the products that we were interested in making an expanding

1257
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,255
The change that we've seen in China has been

1258
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
Lab Hood

1259
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
Significant

1260
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,351
But it's taken Generations

1261
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,375
To take

1262
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:53,471
China from a relatively primitive Manufacturing

1263
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,751
Concern in the 80s

1264
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,335
To a world leader in a number of different Industries today

1265
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,615
They've got great Labor

1266
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,151
Phenomenal work ethic

1267
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,199
Access to Quality raw materials

1268
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,991
They're operating in Global Market

1269
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,319
The key Shoppers Best Value in raw materials anywhere in the world

1270
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:12,159
They've got a willingness to co-invest in the equipment in the tooling and

1271
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,439
People training

1272
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,487
Especially engineering

1273
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,047
Over the last 30 years they've built

1274
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,583
Terrific Inland transfer

1275
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,631
Irritation improve their ports

1276
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,655
Their powers

1277
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,959
Supply and more recently there

1278
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,007
Concern about environmental and

1279
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,055
Sustainability issues has become

1280
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,079
Much more acute

1281
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,127
We got an example in one of our Pact

1282
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,431
Where 80% of our power

1283
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,223
For the factory plus

1284
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
The seven dormitory

1285
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,807
That we operate on this facility

1286
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,831
Are solar power

1287
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:44,671
And there are many factories like that even in the United States today

1288
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
So

1289
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,231
The significant investor

1290
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:50,303
That people have made in wages and benefits

1291
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,607
Healthcare and families and quality of life

1292
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
To be upset by

1293
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,167
Tariff

1294
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,191
Dispute

1295
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
And so we're hoping that the

1296
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
The trade War

1297
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,031
Doesn't happen it will have

1298
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:05,663
As I said not known and unintended consequences not hundreds of thousands of businesses including ours

1299
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,479
Okay so would you be able to or willing

1300
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,527
To move manufacturing somewhere else

1301
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,319
We may be forced to

1302
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
A couple of points on this

1303
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,927
Hampton Inn 1999

1304
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:21,279
Made significant commitment to manufacturing facilities in

1305
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:27,935
Southeast Asia we continue to make those Investments until 2008 9 and 10 when it be

1306
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:31,263
Became clear that if the trends continue

1307
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:37,407
Economic labor environmental health care if the trends continued in China

1308
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:42,271
That we were seeing an ocean Freight continue to be as expensive as it had become

1309
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:48,671
But it might make sense for us to move manufacturing back to the United States which in three or four categories we did in two

1310
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,207
2013 14 and 15

1311
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,487
So we know exactly

1312
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
To the penny

1313
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,535
How much it cost

1314
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,559
To make these products

1315
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
In the United States

1316
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,399
And after three and a half years of trying

1317
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:04,799
We also know we ended up having to shut her those factories and move it back to Southeast Asia because we couldn't be competitive in the

1318
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:09,407
Long-term with other countries manufacturing if we were to move our Manufacturing

1319
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,687
Across the street

1320
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:16,575
Within one country it would take a year it would create incredible disruption and it would be very expensive

1321
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:20,927
To move it to another country is increasingly

1322
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,231
Expensive and increasingly complicated

1323
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,023
Because you got to deal with different

1324
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
Cultures

1325
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,071
Different languages

1326
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:32,447
Different environmental regulation different labor laws Etc and that's his takes time

1327
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,263
And the issue that we've all got

1328
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,287
The people in are in the sky

1329
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:39,615
Have with the Tariff proposal is there's no time

1330
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,895
July

1331
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,687
Proposal was that the Tariff

1332
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Burden on the

1333
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,759
200 billion dollars

1334
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,527
And imports

1335
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,063
Would be around 10

1336
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,623
First that number increases

1337
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
25%

1338
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,671
Any tariff

1339
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,487
Will have a meaningful impact

1340
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,023
Not only are cost

1341
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:03,167
But potentially ultimately the cost of the American Consumer one could argue that it could be short-term but

1342
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,447
Short-term pain

1343
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,983
Which some have described as

1344
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,799
Relatively insignificant short-term pain

1345
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,615
Versus the big picture we believe is true

1346
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,687
But for us to move manufacturing to another country

1347
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,967
Will take time

1348
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:19,039
And there are no guarantees that we're going to be able to

1349
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,623
Replicate all of the different things that we were able to create in China

1350
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:26,463
Okay so let's talk about something a little bit more fun let's talk about innovation

1351
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,743
You guys

1352
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
Last year

1353
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,583
Actually established a relationship with a company called benjilock

1354
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,399
It was on Shark Tank for having a

1355
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
Connected padlock

1356
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:38,495
I would love to get your take and some tips from you

1357
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,775
On how to bring

1358
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,543
Something that

1359
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,591
Very cool very Innovative but

1360
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,127
May not be up to

1361
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,687
The quality standards of a physical

1362
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
Device

1363
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,271
And kind of smelled those two worlds together effect

1364
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,319
It's been an exciting Journey

1365
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,855
One of the things that we've learned over

1366
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:58,975
The last 27 years is that nearly every product sold in the United States is way more complicated than it looks

1367
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:02,303
We looked at categories that you look you'd say

1368
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,327
How's difficult

1369
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:08,703
Could that be I'm not once you begin to understand with the standards in the industry and the consumers expectations

1370
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,983
And Manufacturing process

1371
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,007
He's been required

1372
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,055
We walked away from

1373
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,383
But we do know how to make padlock

1374
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,199
Actually know how to make door locks and we know how to make lighting and Electric

1375
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:21,247
Products and so with benjilock

1376
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,855
When we saw this product at CES in January 2017

1377
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:30,207
And it had one and Innovation award at Cas and we said

1378
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:33,023
How can a padlock when the Innovation award

1379
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,303
An electronic

1380
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:40,703
Michelle and we met Robbie Cabral the inventor and we said while this is a really cool product and boy is it going to be tough

1381
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,519
Because we understand what it takes

1382
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,823
The bill padlocks we didn't know a lot about

1383
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:51,199
And we didn't know a lot about the electronics that would have to support the two of them how you integrate

1384
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,015
We work with Robbie

1385
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,551
And we looked at this

1386
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,831
Technology

1387
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:01,183
There's a way for us to deliver this technology to the consumer in a way that

1388
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,719
Could really Delight

1389
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,511
The consumer and it could

1390
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,559
Meet or maybe even exceed

1391
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,351
The expectations of the event

1392
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,399
Fast forward to October

1393
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,935
And Robbie goes on Shark Tank

1394
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,263
And he develops a relationship and ultimately

1395
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,079
Secures investment from Kevin o leary mr wonderful

1396
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,127
And in November

1397
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,407
Kevin and Robbie

1398
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,175
Gucci Mane

1399
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,503
And I ended up negotiating a

1400
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,783
License arrangement

1401
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:33,183
Where to buy Hampton Wood manufacturing Market benjilock initially in North America and we went on TV

1402
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,999
Robbie finally on November 30th

1403
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,023
Live on

1404
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
CNBC

1405
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,119
Halftime report

1406
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,399
Live on CNBC

1407
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:46,239
We met for the first time live our team has been working with Robbie

1408
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:50,079
4/8 months but he and I didn't actually meet

1409
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,871
Until we saw each other live

1410
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,407
On CNBC

1411
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,735
It was a real feel good moment

1412
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,527
And the last eight months

1413
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,575
Has been filled with

1414
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,135
Engineering back-and-forth testing

1415
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:06,975
Penetration testing all the stuff that goes with making a reliable

1416
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,023
Sakura product that's got some cool technology

1417
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,351
My point is that building a reliable

1418
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,631
Your Hardware Prada

1419
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,655
Is difficult

1420
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,703
Understanding technology

1421
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,471
Today

1422
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,007
Is relatively simple

1423
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,799
But marrying the two

1424
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,567
Is

1425
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,591
Varidesk

1426
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,687
So when you're looking for a way to take a

1427
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:31,807
Very complicated piece of technology and put it into a relatively simple

1428
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,831
Security pro

1429
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,111
Padlock

1430
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:37,183
Deadbolt door lock or security lighter

1431
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:40,767
Coach light fixture or even a camera you've got to pick the right partners

1432
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:44,351
He's got to figure out a way to Roadmaster products

1433
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,375
So that

1434
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:51,263
The Partnerships that you've created and the technologies that are going to be required anticipate not only the

1435
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,543
Consumer needs in the market

1436
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:58,943
Condition of today but can have some kind of line of sight to see what's going to happen Downstream nothing

1437
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
Thing is more

1438
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,503
Complicated today then

1439
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,551
Creating roadmap for The Internet of Things

1440
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:07,135
Okay I agree with you it is hard to create product lines for the inter

1441
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,439
What are the big challenges assoc

1442
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:12,511
Well first you got to start with being able to market the profit

1443
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,535
So

1444
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,839
As we're looking at security Hardware products

1445
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:18,143
We think we're pretty good at making reliable

1446
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
Figure products

1447
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:22,239
Since we've been in business we've sold over a billion and a half

1448
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,775
Units of locks and Light

1449
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,543
Adding an electrical

1450
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:29,663
And we made years of Investments and in some cases we got generations of skill

1451
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,431
That's required

1452
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,455
To build these products

1453
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,735
Understanding the teks

1454
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,759
Is pretty straightforward

1455
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,831
But the steps that we went through were

1456
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,367
Pretty straightforward

1457
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,903
For a consumer packaged Goods

1458
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:43,231
So the first thing you have to decide is can it be done

1459
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,815
The internal sessions that we had talking about can we build

1460
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:47,839
Connected

1461
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,399
Dental that will connect directly to

1462
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,471
Consumers Wi-Fi and would not have power

1463
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:57,567
And just because you can do it doesn't mean that you should

1464
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,103
So we went out and talked to a bunch

1465
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,455
What do you really want in this product and in our case it was

1466
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,735
Security and convenience

1467
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:11,391
The combination of two except to the extent that your product ends up not being either secure or it becomes an

1468
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:14,207
Then you missed the mark and then you got understand

1469
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,487
What your core competency

1470
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,303
What are you good at and then you got to go out and rims

1471
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,863
The rest of it so we need security Hardware

1472
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:26,751
But we didn't know anything about Cloud technology or the software in the firmware in the app development that would

1473
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:29,567
Deport all that so we have to go out and interview partners

1474
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,103
And what made that tough

1475
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,871
And pretty

1476
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,431
What's the whole list of unknown unknown

1477
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:39,551
Because you're talking to people who are going to help you invent something or create something

1478
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,831
That's never been done before

1479
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,367
So how do they point

1480
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:45,951
To something that says in my area of expertise I know I can do this

1481
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
Because they've never done

1482
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,767
Before so

1483
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,303
Iot platform

1484
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,071
AR

1485
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,119
Covering a whole bunch of different Prada

1486
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:56,703
But just because it's an iot product doesn't mean that

1487
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,727
Somebody who has X

1488
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,287
Rotation one area biote is actually going to be able

1489
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,591
Translate their skills into another area

1490
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:08,991
So I might be able to create an iot voice-activated platform but it doesn't mean that I can make a deadbolt I might be

1491
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,551
Able to create a security camera or a light switch

1492
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,623
Coyote but it doesn't mean that I can create a deadbolt

1493
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,183
So we went through and we identified

1494
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,231
Embedded a whole bunch of different partners

1495
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
And

1496
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,303
While we're developing the product we have to

1497
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,399
Continue to do market research to make sure that the world in passes by

1498
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:31,263
While we were busy developing the widget that we had identified back on day one

1499
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,799
And so the array product

1500
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,823
AcuRite head bolt

1501
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,847
And then she like

1502
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,919
Have gone through in the case of a race 70

1503
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,199
Different iterations

1504
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,223
Over the four years

1505
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,015
Most of them in the last 12 months

1506
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:47,647
And benjilock we made most of our changes to the design and development of the product in the last

1507
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,439
90 days before launch

1508
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,975
We launched benjilock

1509
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
Annie

1510
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,791
August of 2018

1511
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:59,935
And as I said we wants to write last Thursday and September and will begin shipping that on or about October 1st

1512
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:03,007
Awesome alright but we've come full circle in this interview

1513
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,543
