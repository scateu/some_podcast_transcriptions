At this is your co-host

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
Kevin tofel

6
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,176
I am back from CES

7
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:21,248
The Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas and Kevin is

8
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,784
Still still

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,344
Still in Pennsylvania

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,624
Dealing with the cold weather

11
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,160
It's 11 degrees

12
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,744
No it's it's an upper twenties today but we did have some snow

13
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,816
I think it was like the first snow of the season for us

14
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,424
Is Dan usually have something right now but

15
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,240
You know I live in a place where when we get snow

16
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,568
Shut it all down

17
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,128
Who know that does not happen here

18
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:53,504
Well so we're going to start off the show we got a lot of goodies plan for you we've got a CES wrap up

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,296
Some final thoughts

20
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,112
We only recorded half the show

21
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:02,976
You were only out at CVS like the second day of a whole week when we recorded the last show

22
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,000
Exactly

23
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,072
So we'll get the rest of CES and will cover

24
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
New bits and bobs for Amazon Echo

25
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,680
And will also talk about

26
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,472
Our guests who is endorsing

27
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,520
Who is the CEO of

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,848
Rectal thermometer did you say he's interesting

29
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,872
Oh India

30
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Sing

31
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,664
Oh okay

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,248
I know that's a great name it is a great name he is also interesting

33
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
So it's

34
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
Like a double on

35
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,344
What is Kenzie

36
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Connected

37
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
Thermometer

38
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:37,024
Imma said thermostat which it is not unless it's a thermostat for the human body which I guess it might be

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
No it doesn't control the temperature

40
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
So it's going to be fascinating

41
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,984
When we do the interview was before why things actually announced their own connect

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
Thermometer at CVS but I'm sick of the kids up because it is $60 to

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
$100

44
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
And having seen both apps

45
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
Kind of like the kids up

46
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
Myself so

47
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
There we have it

48
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
Let's kick it off

49
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,112
With the rest of CES

50
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
What a tide

51
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,464
So when you were not at dueling piano bars

52
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,024
What did you see that we didn't talk about last week

53
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,864
You weren't going to talk about the dueling piano bars you know I had to bring that up

54
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
All right

55
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
So

56
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
For you Kevin

57
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
I met with

58
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,264
CEO of WinCo

59
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
GERD and

60
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:26,176
I discovered some really exciting news for all the wink Hub owners out there which is

61
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
Local

62
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
Troll is coming starting with

63
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Lights

64
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,624
It will come sooner rather than later so the next update for your wink hub

65
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,464
Should give you local control of your lights which means

66
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
Lower latency

67
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,280
Not waiting so long

68
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,352
And I am looking for the local because

69
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,936
When the clouds down I don't want to have my smart devices not working

70
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
Exactly what I'm hoping actually it will

71
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
Maybe take care of me

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,920
Poopoo poopoo poopoo poopoo poopoo what's going on in sequence

73
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
List all at once

74
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Yeah

75
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:04,064
8/8 interesting you have far more lights in your house connected

76
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Then I do

77
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,928
The only I only have one room or have multiple light and it's only two lights

78
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,976
And they do come off do poop

79
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:11,744
But not

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,584
I don't have a whole string of them so that's probably why it doesn't annoy me as much as annoys you

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
I have listened

82
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
My entire kitchen is

83
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
Is connected to my wink

84
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,728
You have how many lights in the kitchen

85
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
Sex

86
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
So sexy boobs

87
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
Text boobs

88
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
And it's

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
Kind of

90
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
I understand that better now

91
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
It's always wondered why does that bother you so much

92
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,040
Play never hit me I don't have that many a single room

93
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,832
If I had a hallway in the boot

94
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,880
In line with the hallway that would be different

95
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Do you like a Runway

96
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,696
Exactly that would be cool

97
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
Follow the blinking lights this way people

98
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
So

99
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,304
The other thing I have from

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,448
Pink is we talked a little bit about Flextronics which now owns them and I'm more convinced

101
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Thing

102
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,056
I'm so gay and there are 1.2 million

103
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,360
Lync qualified devices out there

104
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,944
Which is actually a lot that is not the number of hubs which I could not go

105
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
For the life of me

106
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,064
I'm sure you tried

107
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
I did everything short of sitting on the person

108
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Twitch

109
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
But Define

110
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
No

111
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952
It was not for any of

112
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,512
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas

113
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,839
Probably would actually go in my

114
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,775
Yeah anyway so 1.2 connected devices are devices connected to wink hub

115
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
Yes that's what we know about link

116
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,871
So get excited

117
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,943
Soon actually get details about you no updates

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
The platform that sort of thing

119
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:42,879
I didn't they were actually kind of excited about the bankruptcy

120
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,695
With plans last year to issue a new hub

121
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,255
Actually kind of gay

122
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
Time to

123
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,607
Temperature around new platform switch

124
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,911
For them have been kind of a nice thing

125
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:01,311
I think so because you know you've got if they're open platforms to begin with and you've got what Google's doing with

126
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
Pillow and weaving

127
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
And the whole

128
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
Thread and nexton

129
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,527
I guess they want you home care take that got that to consider there's a lot that has happened

130
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
Since they put that first hello

131
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,903
Going to put the second like in May of last year

132
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
Homekit

133
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
All kinds of things

134
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
Speaking of

135
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,655
Last year home kit was like the belle of the ball at CES

136
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
The sheriff

137
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
Not so much

138
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
We just didn't hear a lot about it

139
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,591
There were a couple homekit company or homekit devices

140
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
Lots of

141
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
You know I devices was out there with

142
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Huge boo

143
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Products

144
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807
We're still waiting for more profiles

145
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
From Apple

146
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,415
And that means certain devices so we have to not work with homekit

147
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
Right so we can lights

148
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
Sir support if we've got

149
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Natalie thermostats

150
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,839
Search supported locks are supported garage doors

151
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,911
Supported but we're still waiting for things like video cameras

152
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
To be supported

153
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:05,311
And that just takes time and so that's kind of what we're waiting Owen more sensors

154
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,127
So that's what we're waiting for on homekit

155
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,711
I think Apple's taking their time for one thing cuz I think they want to do this right

156
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,807
They focus so much on security that has slowed things up in my pendant

157
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,135
I also wonder if they're starting with the basics no lights in the

158
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Baby locks

159
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Thermostat

160
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,743
I wonder how many people

161
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,559
Mainstream people that are starting to build a smart home

162
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
Platform in their house

163
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:34,495
Actually considered a video to be on at the top of the list I know security is important from the homeowner standpoint security is the most

164
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
Most important from a home

165
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
Standpoint most people get into the smart

166
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
For security

167
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Believe it or not

168
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Bites

169
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
Send home automation

170
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
Are actually energy saver

171
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Wood slices part of it

172
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
Secondary

173
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
That's from surveys from both Lowe's and I can

174
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855
Both of those matches

175
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
Interesting

176
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:56,511
They're at their numbers are slightly off but the number one reason a security number two is energy-savings like thermostats

177
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Lighting controls

178
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Distance

179
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,655
Energy savings and then third is like automation

180
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
Lighting and fun

181
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
And yes I know I said lightning twice

182
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,799
That's okay for Energy savings

183
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Lighting for fun

184
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
Yep

185
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:17,503
I just got done I get I totally understand that with the metrics actually show a guy get it

186
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,623
Sometimes I think when I talk about when I talk to people there like video cameras in the house that's just creepy

187
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,719
An apple is kind of like tries to positions of the anti creepy 2

188
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,999
Google another

189
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
Send video cameras in the house

190
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
Looking at your family

191
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
And that is creepy

192
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
Or I think

193
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,471
But there's also video cameras facing Outdoors facie

194
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Windows

195
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:43,615
Indoor Bells sing like your front foyer

196
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
On hallway

197
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
You know

198
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
Is a little less creepy

199
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
So

200
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
And I don't know why I get it

201
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,343
But I also see you like a lot of the use cases that

202
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,647
Kind of tend to resonate with people or things like

203
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
Hey did my kid make it home

204
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:04,095
You can do that with a a little door sensor but you could also do it with like a video camera and then your kid could be like

205
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,471
Word like Raichu crazy notes throughout the day and be like

206
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
Pop in front of the camera and beans

207
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,311
Minecraft cookies and you can be like

208
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
Child

209
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
My phone with notifications with

210
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Advance for cookie

211
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:25,087
Maybe it's not the creepy Factor that's held them back but it's the security aspect of it cuz they want to ensure that nobody else has access to that

212
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,135
That video that you do not want them to have

213
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:33,279
I will say that Apple has done one thing well and people have commented on it

214
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
And we're commenting on it at CES

215
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
Which was

216
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Getting devices

217
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,215
And make it easy for people to get devices online

218
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
As

219
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
People bring more stuff into the home

220
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
Is becoming more and more apparent

221
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,151
Getting them online and typing in your Wi-Fi password

222
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
It's not

223
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Huge pain

224
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,015
But people are becoming sure

225
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,295
Wait a sec

226
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,391
What if I change my SSID for my WiFi network

227
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Crap

228
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,535
Public Service Announcement if you want to change your Wifi password

229
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
Are you have a really like

230
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
What you feel is like

231
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,679
Really awesome SSID which is your Wi-Fi network

232
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
And it's like

233
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,079
A random string of numbers and letters if you're going to bring a lot of connected devices in your home

234
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
You may want to change

235
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
Is that right now to something else

236
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,967
For you bringing all these connected devices cuz you're going to be like

237
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Name of that

238
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,271
A lot in your password

239
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Aesthetic

240
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Going to be

241
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Something you want

242
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,367
How to be able to type

243
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
A bunch of times

244
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:36,767
Yep just name your network Linksys everything will be just fine

245
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,679
But do keep in mind you know if you're going to be connecting a bunch of devices to your home

246
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,471
SSI

247
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
Alaia

248
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,775
Okay so

249
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
That was our little PSA for the day

250
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Cartoons

251
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
Little scoop I heard

252
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,479
Amazon Echo support for thermostat

253
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
Is coming

254
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Soon

255
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,343
Native support native support

256
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
This is going to be like

257
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
Right now

258
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,999
The Echoes supports lights

259
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
And that's it

260
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
In the Smart Home

261
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
Connected home I think is what it's called

262
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399
Thermostat

263
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
Very cool very cool

264
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
I also heard

265
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
And talking to some people

266
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,639
The original plan was to actually along with lights was to support like

267
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:29,503
You know other settings but it became the syntax became too cumbersome

268
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
So they had to back off.

269
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,623
So you know like an Siri how you can have

270
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
Seems like dinner party lighting

271
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
That was kind of the plan to have

272
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
Amazon to

273
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,047
Progesta Logistics around

274
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,631
Figuring out how to do that across so many different

275
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
Possible

276
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
Platform

277
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,727
What is natural language processing

278
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
So

279
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
But it's coming

280
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
The thermostats

281
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
Soon and neck

282
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
Speaking of

283
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
Amazon Echo

284
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
And people don't realize this

285
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:07,391
Will you and I only talk pretty much on the show these days cuz we don't truly work together anymore

286
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
Different from writing perspective

287
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,511
But we wrote I think they exact identical story

288
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303
Based on some news that came out

289
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
This week's coming yesterday in fact

290
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
Yeah I thought my story was probably

291
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,751
I bet it was 300 worth

292
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,335
But we still wrote the same thing what we're talking about is

293
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,687
The Amazon Echo me have a baby is what I'm saying there's reports anything

294
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,247
Journal Wall Street Journal was the first to note this

295
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,903
That it's expected that Amazon will release a smaller version a Portmore portable version and cheaper version

296
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,975
Amazon Echo soon I don't know what soon means but

297
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,023
That's what they're saying I'm taking a couple weeks

298
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,119
So it sounds like from their description is like the size of a beer can

299
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
And

300
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
Yes exactly still a chance

301
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:59,103
I have batteries inside but will also have a docking station so you can recharge those batteries it one of the

302
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,943
Things that we observe you and I both in our separate articles. Talking each other as

303
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
If you have enough battery power

304
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,319
We're hearing that you got to press a button to be able to do your voice commands

305
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
Motorcycle that defeats the whole purpose but

306
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:17,279
The thought is if it's sitting in the docking station in a different room than okay is probably always on microphone least that's what I'm

307
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Open

308
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Why are we hoping

309
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:25,215
Won't because we otherwise we just use our phones or whatever and then there's there's just no point

310
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
Cuz it takes them bad check out of this

311
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Yes

312
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
So

313
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
See the value in having

314
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Multiple echos

315
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,455
Especially if you want to

316
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Smaller

317
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,295
Basically a link to echo to the mama Echo

318
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Elsa satellite

319
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,671
Is multiple in like party mode for your speakers

320
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
Cuz then you have

321
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,767
You can play music around anywhere in your house

322
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,583
It would also be nice to be able to you know

323
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
Give commands

324
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
You know that work throughout your house right

325
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,495
But only if you can talk to it and you don't have to

326
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,543
To touch it because the magic of the echo

327
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Is this

328
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,871
You don't touch anything otherwise

329
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,991
You know I have a good Chilean devices in my house that I can control here by smartphone or through

330
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
Some sort of tactile interface

331
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
The reason I love the echo is because

332
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
I don't have to use any of those

333
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
Guy Curry

334
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,511
I can understand why they want to limit

335
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,839
The always-on microphone when you're running a battery power that's cuz

336
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
You're going to shoot your batteries pretty darn quick

337
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
If it's always listening

338
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,727
So I get that I'm just hoping that they

339
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,287
Haven't always on release an option when it's

340
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
Plugin I can't see why not

341
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Brent there's no

342
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
Power constraint there

343
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
It's plugged in

344
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,247
True I mean your phone has an always-on

345
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,063
The way Amazon's theoretically

346
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,135
In the way Amazon's always on listening

347
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
Works is

348
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
It's always listening

349
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,487
For the trigger word a trigger word

350
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Try not to say

351
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
Correct and then if yours

352
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,143
You know what it starts it wakes up and starts processing

353
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
And sends those

354
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,471
Those words that you said after the trigger work to the cloud

355
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
And then it goes back

356
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
Back to sleep essential

357
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Then it stops

358
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
Sending those

359
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383
There are processors

360
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
Make

361
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
Light work

362
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
That kind of

363
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
AI for listening

364
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
To those were

365
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
Listening for a trigger

366
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,951
And those kind of processors are currently in a lot of next-generation phones or current generation phone

367
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
Like which iPhone is it

368
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
It's the current

369
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
Jen iPhone

370
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,119
Right you can you don't need to be plugged in and you can just

371
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,911
Speak to Siri

372
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
An adult

373
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
Do what you need to do I think it's

374
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,519
I want to say it's only the larger

375
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
Are the two latest iPhones

376
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:44,479
There are processors there's a Qualcomm processor I'm assuming that there's a version of the a

377
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,319
Is it the A7 that Sunday current

378
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,719
Benign

379
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,047
It's okay so that's not insurmountable in that gives you

380
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
Yeah whatever

381
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:05,215
Three four days worth of battery life I am not sure it's been pretty much a day for most people

382
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Really

383
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
Okay so you still have to charge

384
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
Kills that theory

385
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Dead in the water

386
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
Do you know what would solve this whole problem

387
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
I've said it once I said it doesn't time

388
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,343
I'll just let the Amazon Echo app on your smartphone

389
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,159
Listen to your words and Bluetooth them over

390
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,975
Through to the speaker or up to the cloud I mean

391
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,279
We all have a little remote in our hands

392
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,167
All right all of us but Stacy have a little remote in our hands

393
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,775
I think our survey said that like 30% I know I know

394
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:44,895
I know it just seems silly to me that have that app sitting there and not be able to interact with it

395
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
Via voice

396
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Bipolar

397
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
I won't go there again

398
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,623
Alright so

399
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,231
Let's see if this is cheap enough depending we'll see when details come out if we would buy

400
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
We would buy such a thing

401
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
I have a feeling we will

402
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
No matter what

403
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,399
And I'm going to I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's going to

404
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,703
Cost 79 to 8 at $99

405
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
That sounds about right

406
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,847
And you think that we can tell people to buy

407
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,407
Listen put multiple ones in their house I think it would

408
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,223
I have a Sonos already I would rather see Sonos

409
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,063
Let me know Amazon voice services in there

410
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,111
Why isn't there the new Sonos

411
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,159
Aren't they supposed to have a microphone on them

412
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,999
I don't know I haven't looked so I feel like I do

413
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
So if that's the case

414
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
Then

415
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
I don't know if I would need

416
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,167
But that's true that's true I would definitely buy one

417
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
Because I really want

418
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
I don't know if I said that

419
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
But I really want to know

420
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
Echo

421
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
In mybatis

422
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
That's you have said listen

423
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,199
I stripped my head last time and I'm shaking it again to go ahead

424
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:55,039
How do you say I want to hear music while I'm taking a shower and I want to ask

425
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
The time

426
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,855
Weather in the morning I like

427
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Like the news

428
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Honestly

429
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
At the end of the day I want this

430
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
Everywhere in my house

431
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,583
Because I don't want to have to be in a specific room

432
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,631
I have a question or I want to know the time

433
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,727
That's the whole point of that that invisible interface that permeates your smart home

434
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,775
I want it I want it now I want to cheat

435
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Exactly

436
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,335
Alright so

437
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,127
Garnet will buy them

438
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,407
Give it to us

439
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,967
But preferably with always on voice

440
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
So

441
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,879
That is that has he any other oh I was going to say final OCS.

442
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
Are two things worth mentioning

443
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
1

444
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,999
We hate doubt over these tiny little moat

445
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
Switch actually not

446
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
They were introduced maybe last year

447
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
University of Michigan

448
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Has

449
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,727
Developed a technology called

450
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
Easy

451
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Little

452
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,127
Chips like to MMM lacrosse

453
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
Yes they like

454
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,967
I took a picture I'll run it with the podcast

455
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
If you see it

456
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,807
I mean this fits on the tip of your finger like probably like

457
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,623
I don't know like 15 of them could fit on your finger

458
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,511
I don't know about a finger but they say like a hundred and fifty could fit in a thimble

459
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
Istanbul

460
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
I have a connected symbol

461
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,935
They're really tiny and they have

462
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:22,079
A radio they have processing power I mean and they have itsy bitsy photovoltaic cell

463
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,175
Pressure sensors a temperature or

464
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,223
A temperature sensor or motion sensor

465
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
Some processing power

466
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Radio

467
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
And some power on this thing

468
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
Is a couple bucks

469
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Is

470
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,743
What I was told this was at the arm Booth by Andrew over an arm

471
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
And they last for a couple years

472
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,607
I'm not 100% sure what I could do with one of these

473
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,655
Honestly on the radio

474
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
Send the signal light

475
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:52,031
But they want to get it to 20 and I want to start

476
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:57,407
It's funny you say that cuz it was we were talking about it before the show Psych I want these

477
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,735
I don't know what I would do with him that it doesn't matter I just want them

478
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,063
You can make Computing more self-sufficient

479
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
Smaller put in like

480
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,951
More places that were previously on accessible and you can like it or

481
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Information from it I'm like

482
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,255
My God why wouldn't

483
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Yeah

484
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
I mean they're talking about

485
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,887
They were like you could stick this in someone's eye in like measure

486
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
Blood pressure for glaucoma

487
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,239
Yes you we need to get out by Medical

488
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
Coding for it

489
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,079
But that is not hard

490
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,127
I hope I'm curious to see what people

491
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
Eventually do with these things

492
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,711
Yeah you can swallow them yet because

493
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
I need solar

494
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,831
Power I forgot about that I said that before the show I said I want to eat one Justice

495
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,879
I don't know measure something inside body in

496
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,671
Well no solar power there

497
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,255
It's so small you could eat it you could accidentally eat it

498
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
So I was excited about that

499
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
So

500
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,143
Guys get excited tell us what you think

501
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,935
Think you might be able to do with it cuz

502
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
I don't know

503
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:59,615
Maybe the University of Michigan is going to listen to this and they'll be like idea from some random person who listens

504
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Super smart

505
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,175
Probably know y'all probably have like

506
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
Who cashes at these and you're like

507
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
Stacy

508
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Boring

509
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Already have

510
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
Already done

511
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,159
Final CES fight is

512
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
On obsolescence

513
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,999
Chance and we'll talk more about this because it's worth

514
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
About butt

515
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,607
I was shocked at how little people were talking about

516
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
Obsolescence

517
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
At the show

518
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,823
You're sticking like I saw you know the Samsung refrigerator with the Giant

519
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Android phone

520
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,127
And it's very large

521
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
It is

522
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:38,271
Refrigerators get a lot of heavy-duty usage and they last for like 8 or 10 years

523
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,831
And it felt really strange to me to stick

524
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
What is essentially a giant computer in the face of it

525
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,439
In some ways it's super cool cuz like

526
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,511
Yeah I want to be able to read my recipes on my refrigerator

527
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:53,375
Set a rather have it like next to me on the counter or in front of me on the backsplash but that's cool

528
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
And I love

529
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
Message boards and

530
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
Pictures and

531
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,263
Maybe a calendar that reminds me of things on the refrigerator

532
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
I also like

533
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Dang

534
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
Download away

535
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Yeah that is it

536
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Terrible

537
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,711
Place for that

538
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,783
Cuz we spell all kinds of crap on a refrigerator

539
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,575
Right now I think there's like

540
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855
There's some soup

541
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
I'm like two nights ago

542
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
Okay

543
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
I mean I'm going to get to it

544
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Sometimes

545
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
Maybe my husband is

546
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
You know and what do you clean the computer with

547
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
With spandex

548
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,656
Stainless steel refrigerator cleaner

549
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,264
It's a tough call and we've already got so much E-Waste you know on this

550
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,080
May not make the most sense to have these kind of Integrations

551
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,616
And I don't think we can get

552
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:40,736
To your concern now that we figured out how to really disposal stuff the right way especially when we're adding more and more

553
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,016
Trudy's products

554
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
And then that yeah and

555
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,880
I mean what if someone throw something in the kitchen at cracksat screen

556
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
Go to replace your fridge

557
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
Let's hope

558
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,840
But then like think about software updates

559
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
Sand Lake

560
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
Two 5G radios

561
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:04,800
I mean like in your application processor in that thing it's a little slow and you want to run the latest games I mean

562
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,848
If you call someone out and they have to like

563
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
Replace the motherboard on that thing

564
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,504
I don't disagree that I'd rather see these things no more modular in that you know just make it magnetic

565
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
Back on a

566
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:19,392
Application-specific tablet or something in and let it stick up on there so you can just

567
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
Put down in

568
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
Replace that when needed

569
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,256
I don't know yeah I'm just thinking of that

570
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:28,096
Qualcomm didn't answer modular thing for cars a modular Lake

571
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
Electronics

572
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
Box for cars basically

573
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,984
Which is kind of in that line of thinking

574
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,264
Which is good

575
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,592

576
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360

577
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,664
Because 3-g

578
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
It takes forever to load my maps

579
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,064
It's going to be awesome

595
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:26,976

00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
Oh my God what is this

Appreciate it

605
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,432
I am super excited

606
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
Because

607
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,760
Connected thermometers are my

608
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,368
Because I have a 9 year old daughter who is constantly bringing

609
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
So

610
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
Why

611
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
Why did you get the

612
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
It's in your head that

613
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
You're like the world needs

00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,816
Yeah so it looks like the product first

615
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
And tell you about that and then

616
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,656
So it sounds simple it is

617
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:11,008
It's a SmartPhone connected thermometer and makes it easier to take a child's temperature

618
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,544
It automatically stores

619
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,360
Remember screen brightness automatically stores the results

620
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:19,200
Offer you and each member of the family can put in multiple different profiles

621
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
And so that way when you go to the doctor

622
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
And they ask you how did

623
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,576
You were your child's illness start

624
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,600
Grass there's no question

625
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,464
And beyond that it should have realized the vision of what

632
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
About what

633

Our product

634
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800

You need to go see the doctor right away so we tell you that

640
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,768
How does it do this for me so let's say my 9 year old has a temperature of

641
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,584
103 which I always am I

642
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,144
This is really high

643
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,960
Yeah so let's say that it's the middle of night

644
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
3 in the morning

645
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,544
And your nine-year-old comes in here and says mommy mommy

646
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,360
So you pull the kinsa thermometer app

647
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,664
And you get her to take her temperature

648
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
Do you take a temperature

649
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
Usually in under 10 seconds

650
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,040
You get these professionally accurate results

651
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,112

653
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,768
How to start an interesting share that with your doctor later or

654
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Your babysitter

655
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:44,960
You're concerned that she may have some severe symptoms and the app automatically processes that information whether there's a

656
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
High fever

657
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,032
What are the associated symptoms

658
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:53,408
The age of the profile and gives you information if it's cause for concern it'll tell you

659
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,968
And if you want more information on that you just happen

660
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,272
You can get all the sources for the medical experts themselves

661
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,344
Now imagine that you your child has a fever

662
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,624
You're concerned

663
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,488
She may have caught something from one of her friends at school so you go check the health at her school

664
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,560
So we have this group's feature that allows you to opt-in

665
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,352
To seeing the aggregated

666
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,912
Anonymous help stats at your child School

667
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:18,496
And here you see that say 5 out of 24 kids RL

668
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,824
And you see in the message boards that are associated with that group

669
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
Bad strep throat

670
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,896
Well that's a little bit more cause for

671
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,968
Turn the common cold so now you decide to talk to Medical

672
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,760
And starting

673
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:34,624
Middle next year we will have a ton of disintegration that allows you to talk to a doctor right then and there

674
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,904
Right through the app itself

675
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
I'm for now it just gives you that

676
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
Information that

677
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
Hopefully

678
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:44,352
Help you make a decision as to when when and whether you want to go see the doctor

679
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:48,960
Right now it's based on schools and I know that you guys have a program

680
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,496
With your

681
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
Kenneth stick thermometer

682
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,568
At schools

683
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,616
Could you also do this based on like

684
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Zip code

685
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,456
You could and that's part of the broader vision

686
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
So take a huge step back

687
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
We didn't

688
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
Create the product

689
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,624
For the product itself we created a product

690
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,976
And our mission cancer is to create a map of human health

691
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,768
Track and thereby stocks

692
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Spread of disease

693
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,840
We started the company with no product

694
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,120
With no business model

695
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
And with this mess

696
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,704
And we thought to ourselves how can we

697
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
Begin communicating

698
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,032
With someone who has just Fallen ill

699
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,056
To help them

700
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,128
And simultaneously collect the data needed

701
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
To track the spread of disease

702
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,224
And thermometer became the most ideal

703
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
To piggyback

704
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
On the thermometer is

705
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,368
The single most ubiquitous medical product in the world is

706
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,672
The first product that parents turn to

707
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,744
To confirm illness even before they call the docker

708
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
Go online

709
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:50,912
And it allows us to aggregate really interesting information that will help us track

710
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,472
On the spread of many contagious illnesses like

711
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,288
Influenza and like other contagious illnesses

712
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,592
What are the challenges in dealing with

713
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,384
Information like this is

714
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,712
It's medical data and people might be kind of worried about

715
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
You know having their children

716
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,064
Labeled as having some sort of awful contagious

717
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
How do you handle things like privacy

718
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
And identify

719
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,280
Yes absolutely it's really important

720
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
To us

721
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,608
Engender the trust of our users

722
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,936
Xiamen certainly one of our highest priorities and buildings product in

723
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,520
People are sensitive to the fact that there is health information

724
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,872
So first we adhere to all regulation

725
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,896
State local

726
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,712
I'm in Federal Regulations around health information

727
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:40,832
And we have a policy of never sharing anyone's individual information without their Express

728
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
That will never happen

729
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,184
The more importantly I think it's important to understand what kind of information

730
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,488
These are ensuring by using prod

731
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,024
It's really common

732
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,840
Fever and Common Sense

733
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,656
Things that everyone has it's not very sensitive

734
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,240
We're not asking you for whether you're

735
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:04,128
Cancer positive HIV positive excetera not if there's nothing like that it's it's very common symptoms and it's

736
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,408
Yunnan temperature

737
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,992
Second by default we don't actually ask

738
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,016
Personal

739
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,808
You don't have to create a login to

740
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
Use the product

741
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:19,488
That's again to engender The Trusted user really help everyone to understand that what our goal is to add

742
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,024
Target population data

743
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,840
Should we understand the spread of disease it's not about

744
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
Marketing information

745
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:29,728
Necessarily to you it's not about collecting your information it's about this broader mission

746
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,544
That will not only help you but will help societies

747
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
Okay

748
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
I'll keep that in mind

749
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
Your history is very

750
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,920
Very interesting

751
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,248
You actually worked for the clintons help finish it for a while

752
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
Yes so

753
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
How did all this kind of come into being

754
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
In a place because

755
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
It's kind of a good story

756
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,928
Yeah it was really born

757
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,744
Are my experiences there was born out of my frustration

758
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:58,656
I'm in my final year there was there for about 5 years my final year I remember being in this meeting

759
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
Where

760
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,984
That this was the final meeting to allocate

761
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,264
Almost to

762
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,800
A hundred million dollars

763
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,104
The curb stop or prevent the spread of disease

764
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,896
This was a major funder in that

765
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,200
In a global health wealth and I remember being in this meeting

766
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
And scene

767
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,272
Some of the people that were providing

768
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,672
I remember there was an expert malaria that stood up and said you know they're 280 million cases somewhere in the realm tears were there

769
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:25,024
And I remember the next expert which is a professor at a major ivy league Institution

770
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,864
I'm still up and said there are over a million cases of malaria

771
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,912
I thought to myself

772
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Wow

773
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,776
You have no idea we're talking about it more than three factors

774
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,312
Difference in the projections

775
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,640
And it became really clear

776
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,944
Stats on the world doesn't have

777
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
That system

778
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:49,088
To really understand where and when does this disease is spread spreading in real time was really really frustrated

779
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,744
I'm not the most patient person to world but I was increasingly frustrated I remember I pulled out my phone cuz I thought to myself man

780
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
Is very quickly

781
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,584
I was looking Google Maps

782
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,120
Trying to figure out how to get

783
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
I'm looking Google Maps

784
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,960
And I'm watching him out

785
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,288
And I'm looking Google Maps

786
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,568
Money and it struck me that

787
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,104
We have so much

788
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
Real-time information

789
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,176
Every other ass

790
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
Burl Ives

791
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,016
We know we know what our neighbor's house cost

792
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,088
Through price of Zillow and Trulia we know

793
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,136
How to get downtown fastest

794
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
Google Maps

795
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,208
In ways we know what our neighbors dog is

796
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,744
Feeling like through Facebook

797
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,048
And yet we have almost zero in French

798
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
When it comes to

799
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,864
The health situation around us

800
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,168
Not situation effects of intimately

801
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,008
And it was a travesty it was complete travesty.

802
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,568
The world spins so much

803
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,360
Money I mean if you aggregate

804
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,152
The amount of money spent

805
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:51,552
I'm trying to curb stop or prevent the spread of illness whether it's the flu whether it's strep throat whether it's croup or

806
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
Whooping cough

807
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
Or malaria age

808
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,416
Is TB a respiratory infection will you add that up

809
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
We're talking about

810
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,976
Several GDP

811
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
Key points of the world

812
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,608
Massive amount of money hundreds of billions of dollars

813
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,912
And so how do you allocate

814
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
How do you put the Reese

815
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
The drugs a diagnostic

816
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,288
The vaccines that work that we know work

817
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,824
How do you direct those

818
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
The people who need the most

819
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
In a timely manner

820
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,408
That was sort of work answer was

821
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
Well that was the first pillar

822
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,992
How cancer came to be

823
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,808
We believe that stopping the spread of disease

824
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
Is one of the biggest

825
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,184
Ways to change the base of a world in which there was no

826
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
Spreading

827
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,512
We also believe that the way to do that

828
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,792
Is with better information

829
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,560
About wearing

830
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
When it's spreading so you can intervene early

831
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:40,448
With the drugs that Diagnostics to vaccines and other products that work

832
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,008
You can stop it before it affects the larger

833
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,592
So I still feel like you're going to have to just quarantine all the chill

834
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,944
With that in mind you guys are started

835
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,248
A really interesting program where you

836
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,296
You pass out the cheaper version

837
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,624
And here's why I should say that you guys have two versions of your product right

838
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
Be smart

839
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,208
I guess it's the cancer

840
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
Smart Stick

841
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,256
Thermometer

842
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,816
I need to call the thermostat so if I do that tell me

843
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:11,936
It is $20 and then you have the ear thermometer which is $60 in the ear thermometer

844
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,240
Pop it in the rear end

845
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:18,848
And it works and then the Smart Stick is a traditional you stick it under your tongue

846
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
Thermometer

847
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Kind of thing

848
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
So

849
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,992
The cheaper version is the one that you guys give out to schools

850
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:30,368
And you know it had those in schools for about 18 months and some places yes

851
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
That's right

852
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:37,792
So we threw our fluency program we give the kinsa smart thermometer the stickers in a way and we give it to school

853
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,376
Schools around the country that are deserving of its where they are really enthusiastic

854
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,448
And it's a philanthropic program

855
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:48,800
And we see how those small clusters of parents use the product

856
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,592
And we've had about

857
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:57,248
9 schools have been using for 18 months and then we increased the size of the program this year and we

858
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:01,856
By the end of this flu season they'll be more than a hundred schools using the products are really excited about that

859
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,904
We have this great story I love this

860
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,208
Within a week and a half of launching is program

861
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,048
A 1-carat went under their school group and posted saying

862
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,328
My chemistry in the morning

863
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,120
My child has rosy red cheeks and

864
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,656
Checking the origin

865
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:18,752
Another person responded still in the middle of the night

866
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
Another person

867
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
Responded and said

868
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
My child has

869
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,592
The same thing

870
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,384
They had a rash

871
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
Interfacing

872
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,992
Inner chest with red and a fever and the doctor diagnose this

873
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:33,856
Disease and he basically told us there's not much you can do but it's highly contagious

874
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:37,952
The first person respondents said so no need to take them to the Urgent Care Facility

875
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,976
? right

876
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:45,376
It's exactly the kind of information you need right she was basically saying to seeking information to make a decision

877
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:49,728
Do I need to go in right away is this really deeply concerning or can I wait till the morning

878
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,544
To book an appoint with my normal pediatrician

879
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,104
How do you see the stuffing illness

880
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,408
Because that is kind of cool right

881
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,432
And then

882
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:02,016
What comes next do you need more devices

883
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,832
Or is it just how do you change behaviors

884
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,880
Yes they see we're just getting

885
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,928
We believe that when we reach

886
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,976
A level of penetration

887
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,536
Between a quarter and a half of 1

888
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
We will have in

889
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,376
Information to the tap to start taking into

890
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,144
Flu season

891
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,680
Faster and better than any

892
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,752
Hyperlocal bases in really empowering the system

893
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,056
I'm going to answer your question

894
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:29,152
What does this particular program do parents with information

895
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
To respond early

896
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,016
And ultimately we believe that that's going to result

897
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,040
Unless

898
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,064
Children matter of fact

899
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,088
If you get

900
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,648
Your child to the doctors office early

901
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,696
Then it's less likely to affect other children

902
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:48,096
But the earlier you texted me earlier you were likely to stop at whether that's affecting another person or whether that's progressing to significantly

903
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,680
If you guys are excited about this

904
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,752
You can get cancer thermometer

905
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:01,408
In Target you can get both kinds you can get the $20 stick in CVS stores I believe

906
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
Both on Amazon

907
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,992
Interested in the fluency program

908
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:09,344
How could they get involved with something like that or is that just you got to convince your school

909
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,648
Well if you're excited about the product

910
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:18,048
And you are somebody who would be enthusiastic about telling other parents at your child's school about it we'd love

911
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,328
Look for you to apply to fluency

912
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
It's kinsahealth

913
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,912
. com fluency

914
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,192
And you can fly there

915
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,984
And you'll have someone from cancer

916
