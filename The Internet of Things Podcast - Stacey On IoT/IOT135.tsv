EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:31,904	| IOT135 |	Actually we are talking about
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:33,440	| IOT135 |	Security
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:36,256	| IOT135 |	Because every good home automation
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:38,816	| IOT135 |	Company knows they've got to get into security
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:41,376	| IOT135 |	We've had Lexi's SmartThings partnering with
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:41,888	| IOT135 |	With ATT
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:43,168	| IOT135 |	We've had
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:43,936	| IOT135 |	Ring
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:44,704	| IOT135 |	We had
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:45,216	| IOT135 |	Next
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:46,496	| IOT135 |	And now
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:47,264	| IOT135 |	We've got
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:48,288	| IOT135 |	Amazon
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,568	| IOT135 |	Looks like it's getting a
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:51,360	| IOT135 |	Into the space with a grin
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,128	| IOT135 |	New
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:52,896	| IOT135 |	Security camera
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:53,920	| IOT135 |	What do you think it is
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:55,456	| IOT135 |	Actually we should talk about what it is
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:55,968	| IOT135 |	Before we ask
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:02:03,392	| IOT135 |	Yeah so this is a smart move by Amazon they're offering actually to new things and they work together one is
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:05,440	| IOT135 |	Is there new webcam which
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:09,536	| IOT135 |	Just cause 1 1999 and we'll talk about some add-ons that you can get
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:13,120	| IOT135 |	Options you can add on for that and then they also have Amazon
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:18,240	| IOT135 |	Key which is a way to use a connected lock or selling you the lock
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:21,568	| IOT135 |	And that will allow you to let Amazon
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:22,592	| IOT135 |	Prime deliveries
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,360	| IOT135 |	Right in your house
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:25,152	| IOT135 |	What do I think of that
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:27,712	| IOT135 |	I even work from home so I don't think I would
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,480	| IOT135 |	Need that
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:33,600	| IOT135 |	But I could see why people in the 37 Metro areas that thrilling us out in
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:38,464	| IOT135 |	Some of them might like this I probably would have a camera with the key
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:40,768	| IOT135 |	Amazon Keys what they're calling us little bundle
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:41,792	| IOT135 |	Just so I could see
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:44,352	| IOT135 |	The people that come in and deliver
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:46,400	| IOT135 |	Smartly Amazon also partnering with
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:51,520	| IOT135 |	Bunch of their home services so if you use Merry Maids or Rover or whatever
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:54,080	| IOT135 |	You can allow those people in your house as well as much as
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,128	| IOT135 |	And I
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:03:00,992	| IOT135 |	I feel like this is a totally logical extension you can only actually get the key
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,528	| IOT135 |	Integration with Amazon
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,320	| IOT135 |	I'm Prime so the idea is
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,600	| IOT135 |	Yes Amazon's just
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,648	| IOT135 |	Shipping stuff left and right
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,184	| IOT135 |	Do you you put more stuff
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,976	| IOT135 |	Through Amazon Prime because why wouldn't you
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,048	| IOT135 |	Assure yourself that never
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:17,632	| IOT135 |	Rockets lost this is also good for Amazon because you have to deal less
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:18,656	| IOT135 |	Package theft
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:20,448	| IOT135 |	Shrinkage or leakage
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:23,776	| IOT135 |	Then it's a package I don't know in the retail thing it's shrinkage
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,104	| IOT135 |	Can I call it fast
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,384	| IOT135 |	Alright theft
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:31,456	| IOT135 |	So this is
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,992	| IOT135 |	It makes sense
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:36,832	| IOT135 |	If I were a security company that's hosting on AWS
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,624	| IOT135 |	And a lot of them are I might kind of
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,416	| IOT135 |	Be like yo Amazon
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,184	| IOT135 |	What are you doing
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,464	| IOT135 |	This is our busy
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,512	| IOT135 |	But that's kind of Amazon
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:46,048	| IOT135 |	Cross to bear especially with
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,864	| IOT135 |	I want to buy Whole Foods all the retailers are like
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:49,632	| IOT135 |	Let's get out of this
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:53,728	| IOT135 |	Yes so just so folks understand the locks are actually
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:59,360	| IOT135 |	Existing locks you could already buy but they are two of them Yale and Kwikset are working with Amazon
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:03,200	| IOT135 |	Ski-in home kit cost to 4999 for the lock
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:05,760	| IOT135 |	And also that includes the Amazon Cloud cam
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:08,576	| IOT135 |	You're getting the whole bundle there for $250
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:12,672	| IOT135 |	There's also free Professional installation which I think it's very smart of Amazon to offer
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,208	| IOT135 |	Yeah but it's okay
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:15,232	| IOT135 |	Everyone stays
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,000	| IOT135 |	PSA
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,536	| IOT135 |	Install your own lock it doesn't take
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:19,839	| IOT135 |	I put a video up on the side yard
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,607	| IOT135 |	It's not hard
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,375	| IOT135 |	And
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:23,423	| IOT135 |	Kevin you came up with this brilliant idea with
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:24,959	| IOT135 |	Is probably accurate
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:25,727	| IOT135 |	My lock
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,007	| IOT135 |	Currently cuz I have a quick
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,543	| IOT135 |	Set Z-Wave lock
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,823	| IOT135 |	I don't think that's going to work with this
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,615	| IOT135 |	It definitely
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,127	| IOT135 |	Is not
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:35,455	| IOT135 |	In my opinion it's the reason I say I say definitely in my
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,991	| IOT135 |	Definitely in your opinion
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,271	| IOT135 |	All right
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,295	| IOT135 |	Definitely not
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,831	| IOT135 |	The reason I don't think it will work
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:43,647	| IOT135 |	Oreck is because I look at the Kwikset
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:46,719	| IOT135 |	Lock that is included with the cloud cam
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,743	| IOT135 |	And the in-home
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:51,583	| IOT135 |	Kitty cat and that model does come in two flavors
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,607	| IOT135 |	One with Z-Wave
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:55,167	| IOT135 |	One with the sticky I have a Z-Wave on also
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,959	| IOT135 |	The reason I don't think is going to work is
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:01,567	| IOT135 |	Because the Amazon Echo Plus which is a hub does not support
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,335	| IOT135 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,359	| IOT135 |	So
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:06,943	| IOT135 |	I presume Amazon a smartly using the zigbee once we can work with their hub
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:08,223	| IOT135 |	Stubs not required
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:09,503	| IOT135 |	You can have any other hub
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,783	| IOT135 |	That's fine but I just
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,319	| IOT135 |	Leaning towards it not working
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:14,879	| IOT135 |	They have a new stamp works with Matt Ma
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,927	| IOT135 |	On this as well so we'll see if it was lock
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,439	| IOT135 |	Fox github
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:21,023	| IOT135 |	If that's works with Matt Emmaus
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:21,535	| IOT135 |	Really into
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,839	| IOT135 |	Ectopic so I've talked to
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,631	| IOT135 |	Listen to Philip Rivers and this stamp is
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,399	| IOT135 |	Is relatively new
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:28,447	| IOT135 |	And it's something that Amazon has
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:29,727	| IOT135 |	Pushing
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:30,495	| IOT135 |	Partners
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,263	| IOT135 |	Affairs
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,031	| IOT135 |	To work with
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:36,639	| IOT135 |	Amazon Echo Show side what it means is your
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:38,431	| IOT135 |	To get that sticker you're going to have to
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,455	| IOT135 |	To show your video
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,735	| IOT135 |	It's on the
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:42,015	| IOT135 |	Show
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,295	| IOT135 |	Some partners are like
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,343	| IOT135 |	And some of them are actually
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,879	| IOT135 |	Concerned that this is Amazon's
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,415	| IOT135 |	To get more data from
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,207	| IOT135 |	React be true
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:53,279	| IOT135 |	It could be it right now some of them are like
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,839	| IOT135 |	You know do I really need a works with Madam a sticker I have a
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,863	| IOT135 |	Skill that's fine
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:57,631	| IOT135 |	That's efficient
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,167	| IOT135 |	This looks like a little bit more than I want
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:03,775	| IOT135 |	How to take on right now so this is kind of an interesting there's a behind-the-scenes thing happening
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:05,311	| IOT135 |	With Amazon and it
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:05,823	| IOT135 |	Its partners
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:11,199	| IOT135 |	Well and that I totally understand on the other side of the equation from a consumer stand
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,223	| IOT135 |	1.5
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,247	| IOT135 |	Showing this little
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:16,831	| IOT135 |	Works with Madam a it gets rid of the whole conversation of
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,599	| IOT135 |	Which radios
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:20,159	| IOT135 |	Zigbee Z-Wave you don't need that on there anymore
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:22,207	| IOT135 |	Confusing keep on saying what works and what doesn't
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:22,975	| IOT135 |	Kind of like
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:24,255	| IOT135 |	Dunkin logo
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:26,815	| IOT135 |	So I think it's rather clever from a consumer-facing
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:28,351	| IOT135 |	Totally agree
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:29,375	| IOT135 |	All right
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,935	| IOT135 |	So this is Amazon's move into
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:33,727	| IOT135 |	Security I wonder if we'll see them pop out
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:35,007	| IOT135 |	Sensors later on our part
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:39,871	| IOT135 |	Week
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,151	| IOT135 |	Wink has a new
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:42,687	| IOT135 |	Security bundle
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,711	| IOT135 |	For $200
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,735	| IOT135 |	It is
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,015	| IOT135 |	Smart Security is
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:50,623	| IOT135 |	Kevin as a wink owner are you excited this has
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,391	| IOT135 |	To open close
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:55,487	| IOT135 |	Got a siren and it has a
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,255	| IOT135 |	Camera light
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,023	| IOT135 |	Looking
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:58,047	| IOT135 |	Motion detector
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,071	| IOT135 |	It is not actually
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,375	| IOT135 |	And all this is for
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:01,887	| IOT135 |	199
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,215	| IOT135 |	Did your 499
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:05,727	| IOT135 |	$500
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:11,103	| IOT135 |	Yeah so it's interesting that they're bundling all this and
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:15,711	| IOT135 |	Also they're not requiring or adding on any monthly fees this is definitely for
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:20,063	| IOT135 |	Somebody wants security on their own they want to monitor their own stuff through their apps and whatnot
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:22,879	| IOT135 |	So I think it's clever of work to do I don't
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:24,927	| IOT135 |	Really need some of these things but
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:26,207	| IOT135 |	Let me grab some of the
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:28,511	| IOT135 |	Door window sensors to give them a try
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:31,583	| IOT135 |	The next thing is Wink works with so many things I still
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:32,351	| IOT135 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,119	| IOT135 |	Of course
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:35,167	| IOT135 |	I already have some of these products just
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,959	| IOT135 |	You know there's a way prices you can get anywhere
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,031	| IOT135 |	Good for first time buyers
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,311	| IOT135 |	Percent that seems to be a big
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,871	| IOT135 |	Keane everybody's aiming towards first time buyers
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:47,199	| IOT135 |	Yes I think that's actually why
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:49,759	| IOT135 |	The Amazon Echo Hub that we talked about a minute ago
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,807	| IOT135 |	Doesn't matter too many people that it doesn't
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:52,575	| IOT135 |	Work with
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,855	| IOT135 |	Z-Wave because
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:56,927	| IOT135 |	It's not meant for people who already have a lot of Z-Wave products
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:59,999	| IOT135 |	It's meant for people getting started in Smart Homes
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,791	| IOT135 |	As with this wink Lookout B
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:02,815	| IOT135 |	I would argue that
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,327	| IOT135 |	Patterson
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,911	| IOT135 |	And we'll never know
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,191	| IOT135 |	You'll never know
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,215	| IOT135 |	Good for that
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,007	| IOT135 |	So yes I agree with you
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,287	| IOT135 |	I think
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:13,567	| IOT135 |	Are some interesting pricing here at
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,591	| IOT135 |	The other thing I would
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,871	| IOT135 |	Be interested with is
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,639	| IOT135 |	Other than
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,943	| IOT135 |	Security I've actually tried to mess with
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:19,967	| IOT135 |	Emotion sensors
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,991	| IOT135 |	Pulled motionsense
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,527	| IOT135 |	Answers into my Linksys
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:27,903	| IOT135 |	I was got a little frustrated because they could do open close but a lot of these sensors have other readings
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:30,463	| IOT135 |	That wink would never pick up so
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:30,975	| IOT135 |	I'm curious
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,511	| IOT135 |	How
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:35,583	| IOT135 |	In adding these if wink is going to expand the
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,607	| IOT135 |	The capabilities for
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,119	| IOT135 |	For all of it
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,447	| IOT135 |	Because there are definitely some things that I would like to
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,727	| IOT135 |	I have existing
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,775	| IOT135 |	Window sensors that I would love to add to
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:44,799	| IOT135 |	Weak sister
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:51,455	| IOT135 |	Yeah no I totally understand that and I've seen what you're talking about any depends on the product
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:57,087	| IOT135 |	So I don't know if it's an all-or-nothing thing with wink I've actually gotten temperature and other things from motion sensors
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,623	| IOT135 |	It does depend on the product
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:00,671	| IOT135 |	It's basically if wink is done
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:01,695	| IOT135 |	Wink and
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,231	| IOT135 |	Device manufacturer
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:06,815	| IOT135 |	Exactly
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,863	| IOT135 |	So also on the security front
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,143	| IOT135 |	People have been asking
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:13,215	| IOT135 |	About this this is crazy and I have been
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:15,007	| IOT135 |	Looking under rocks for all the bad things
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:19,615	| IOT135 |	This is a camera for $20
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:20,895	| IOT135 |	From
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,919	| IOT135 |	A company called wise labs
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,455	| IOT135 |	Actually based in
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,223	| IOT135 |	Seattle
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:27,551	| IOT135 |	I am so suspicious Kevin will tell you that I liked was
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:29,599	| IOT135 |	I was clicking through on the terms and condition for the
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,623	| IOT135 |	The price
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,951	| IOT135 |	Home theater
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,231	| IOT135 |	Website somewhere
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:36,511	| IOT135 |	Just for entertainment purpose
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:39,071	| IOT135 |	But they don't appear to be at least
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:42,143	| IOT135 |	So the camera actually the hardware looks really good
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,703	| IOT135 |	I do I'm surprised
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:46,239	| IOT135 |	And your skepticism is
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:50,847	| IOT135 |	Well founded I'll say that right up front but I don't see any morning flag cic nice Hardware
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:54,431	| IOT135 |	I see a 1080p camera full HD night vision two-way audio
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:55,967	| IOT135 |	It's $20
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,503	| IOT135 |	It has an app
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:02,111	| IOT135 |	That will alert you with motion and what not depending on how you have it set up it has an
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:05,695	| IOT135 |	MicroSD card slot if you want continuous recording on your own which I think is
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,463	| IOT135 |	Great
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:08,767	| IOT135 |	Because if you control that but it will work with a
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:11,327	| IOT135 |	Cloud services running on AWS
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:16,447	| IOT135 |	And for no extra fee will actually record 10 to 15 second Clips whenever it sees motion and whatnot
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:19,263	| IOT135 |	My issue or maybe why it's
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:22,335	| IOT135 |	So inexpensive it doesn't integrate with any
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,103	| IOT135 |	Cubs everything
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:26,175	| IOT135 |	This is strictly I got a camera cameras
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:32,063	| IOT135 |	And I use the app that comes with it to get my alerts and so on and so forth so it's kind of limited in that respect maybe you can work with
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,367	| IOT135 |	This the night or something but
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:36,415	| IOT135 |	I don't know for $20 I may actually
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,951	| IOT135 |	Grab one or two or three of these
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:38,719	| IOT135 |	Too late
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:40,255	| IOT135 |	I just bought one Kevin
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,583	| IOT135 |	But it's on backorder
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,119	| IOT135 |	The okay so you didn't buy the last one
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:46,655	| IOT135 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:47,679	| IOT135 |	Keepin On
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:48,959	| IOT135 |	So yes
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:49,983	| IOT135 |	We're going to buy it
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,287	| IOT135 |	And tell you what we
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,823	| IOT135 |	Please take and if I hate it
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,615	| IOT135 |	Perhaps I'll even give it away in the
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:57,919	| IOT135 |	All right
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:59,199	| IOT135 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,991	| IOT135 |	Oh that's talk about noon
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:01,759	| IOT135 |	Guys
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:05,855	| IOT135 |	This is very exciting this is a startup I actually broke the news about the start of
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:06,879	| IOT135 |	Like a month ago
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,671	| IOT135 |	Gansett actually
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,743	| IOT135 |	Yeah the CEO is Eric Charlton who is
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:13,023	| IOT135 |	Before I had a business
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,303	| IOT135 |	At nest
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:16,095	| IOT135 |	And there's a bunch of Nest folks there
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,631	| IOT135 |	And this is a lighting
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,399	| IOT135 |	Smart lighting
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,423	| IOT135 |	That is
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,983	| IOT135 |	Actually really interesting looking
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,263	| IOT135 |	You guys know that I love
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,031	| IOT135 |	Love lights
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:27,615	| IOT135 |	And what his company is done is they've created a
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,895	| IOT135 |	Light switch that you install
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,175	| IOT135 |	And it has
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:30,943	| IOT135 |	Croisette
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,455	| IOT135 |	Has a couple thing
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,735	| IOT135 |	1
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,503	| IOT135 |	It says
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:37,855	| IOT135 |	Oh hey what are the lights in this room so it detects the bulbs and what they're capable of
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:41,439	| IOT135 |	Once it's installed and then it also has presets
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,975	| IOT135 |	Burberry is like relax
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,767	| IOT135 |	And daylight and other
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,047	| IOT135 |	Three settings
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:47,839	| IOT135 |	And then it automatically hand
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,351	| IOT135 |	Is all of that
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:49,887	| IOT135 |	I think this is
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:50,911	| IOT135 |	Really interesting
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:54,751	| IOT135 |	Because as a person who's invested in lots of crazy lighting
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:55,775	| IOT135 |	Schemes colored balls
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:59,359	| IOT135 |	LEDs of various Hues and warm temperatures
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,127	| IOT135 |	Whites
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,663	| IOT135 |	So many
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,431	| IOT135 |	Light switches
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,711	| IOT135 |	I can tell you
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:05,247	| IOT135 |	Most people do not want
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,295	| IOT135 |	They just want to hit a button
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,831	| IOT135 |	And have like
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,855	| IOT135 |	A couple options
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:10,367	| IOT135 |	It look good in there
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,671	| IOT135 |	And that's what this is promising to do
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:19,071	| IOT135 |	Yeah that's I think the big drug you know a lot of people don't want to go through the rigmarole as you said of setting up different scenes
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,607	| IOT135 |	I don't really know what's up
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,911	| IOT135 |	Good lighting setup you know so if these are
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:27,519	| IOT135 |	No professionally-designed you know maybe they're going to just wow you I don't know but this interesting approach
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:29,567	| IOT135 |	It's actually a common one
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:33,151	| IOT135 |	So there's a startup actually in Austin Texas that works on super high-end
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:36,223	| IOT135 |	It's called ketra and they actually make
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:38,271	| IOT135 |	Crazy awesome lights
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,039	| IOT135 |	I would love to have them in
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:40,575	| IOT135 |	But I am not that way
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,647	| IOT135 |	And it's actually also something that like a Lutron
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,183	| IOT135 |	If you get like a professional
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:49,535	| IOT135 |	Install Nautica set up at the the fancy Lutron if you get that they'll have
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,047	| IOT135 |	Lighting design
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,327	| IOT135 |	Program the
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:55,679	| IOT135 |	So basically it's bringing that idea of having a
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,703	| IOT135 |	Professional lighting
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:58,495	| IOT135 |	Installer dude come into your house at
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,263	| IOT135 |	The program your stuff
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,799	| IOT135 |	Except
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:01,823	| IOT135 |	This company is going
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,591	| IOT135 |	To do it with
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:04,895	| IOT135 |	Is it $399
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:05,407	| IOT135 |	Piece of hardware
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:06,687	| IOT135 |	Yes
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,711	| IOT135 |	And the package can
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:08,223	| IOT135 |	Pain
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,295	| IOT135 |	Will you get one room director switch
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,831	| IOT135 |	Two extension switches
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,367	| IOT135 |	And three wall plates
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,927	| IOT135 |	For 399
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:21,279	| IOT135 |	99 if you just wanted room director switch which is the main smarts that's
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:24,095	| IOT135 |	199 99 storage room you going to add
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:27,935	| IOT135 |	Cost of two hundred bucks and then each extension switch for that room is 99
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:31,263	| IOT135 |	9 so it's not an expensive by any means but
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,287	| IOT135 |	There's a definite convenience.
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,847	| IOT135 |	Oh yeah and again
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:36,127	| IOT135 |	If I look at all that I've spent
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,919	| IOT135 |	If I look at my Hue bulbs
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:39,199	| IOT135 |	Four of those at 6
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:39,711	| IOT135 |	D-box
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:44,063	| IOT135 |	240 bucks so I'm halfway there and then I still had to buy some
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:46,111	| IOT135 |	I did install a switch that
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:47,135	| IOT135 |	Kept it on for me
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:49,439	| IOT135 |	So that's another fifty bucks
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:51,231	| IOT135 |	So now I'm at 300 and
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,767	| IOT135 |	I'm still doing the work of program
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:58,911	| IOT135 |	Price put it all into perspective and the master switch you put in your room
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:00,447	| IOT135 |	And then the extension switch
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,983	| IOT135 |	They talk to it via some
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:02,751	| IOT135 |	Proprietary wire
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,567	| IOT135 |	Of course they do
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:09,919	| IOT135 |	And that
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,431	| IOT135 |	Controlling
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,991	| IOT135 |	Is it like a three-way set up or is it like
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,015	| IOT135 |	All around the house
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:18,367	| IOT135 |	Build-A-Bear focus on room so you maybe you could have like
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:22,975	| IOT135 |	1 Portico master switch control in two rooms if you want the same Lighting in that room
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:25,023	| IOT135 |	But it seems to me like you're going to want
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:27,327	| IOT135 |	One of these in every room 101 master switch
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:36,543	| IOT135 |	Yeah alright this doesn't include both people should be very clear that does include both but it works
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,823	| IOT135 |	Text with regular ball
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,127	| IOT135 |	Your bulbs do not need to
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:42,431	| IOT135 |	In fact it's probably better if they
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:42,943	| IOT135 |	Arcsmart
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:46,271	| IOT135 |	Because a grief I test these things
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,063	| IOT135 |	You don't need to SmartThings
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:50,879	| IOT135 |	Vying for control of your lights cuz
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:51,647	| IOT135 |	They're going to fight
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:54,719	| IOT135 |	Smart thing plus smart thing equals dumb things because yeah they fight
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,279	| IOT135 |	Terrible why can't they just get along
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:59,071	| IOT135 |	Alright other quick cool gadgets
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,375	| IOT135 |	Linkee which is a
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,399	| IOT135 |	Touch screen
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:05,215	| IOT135 |	Smart panel thing for Google assist
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:08,031	| IOT135 |	Reminds me exactly of the nucleus
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,567	| IOT135 |	Which was a touch screen
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:11,615	| IOT135 |	Smart panel intercom system thing for
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:12,895	| IOT135 |	Madam
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:15,967	| IOT135 |	And it kind of reminds me of the Echo Show and that it is
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:17,759	| IOT135 |	Very
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,527	| IOT135 |	Attractive
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:23,135	| IOT135 |	I see why you're saying that it does look like a mini
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,415	| IOT135 |	Echo Show to me
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:28,767	| IOT135 |	Because it's a 5-inch touch screen so small and it's got the speaker Grill along the bottom
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:31,327	| IOT135 |	I'm a very small iMac
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,351	| IOT135 |	To me because it's the
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,887	| IOT135 |	That black and silver look to it
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,935	| IOT135 |	So you write it works with Google Assistant
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,983	| IOT135 |	It has a far field microphone array
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:40,031	| IOT135 |	WiFi zigbee and Bluetooth
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,055	| IOT135 |	Wireless built
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,079	| IOT135 |	10 +
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:45,919	| IOT135 |	Yeah I mean it's only interesting to me because it's the first
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:47,967	| IOT135 |	Google Assistant item with a
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,479	| IOT135 |	A touch screen
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:51,039	| IOT135 |	Answer my phone it's Unique
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:54,623	| IOT135 |	Wakes up your phone while I've said that Furlong were carrying all these things right around
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,183	| IOT135 |	But that's okay
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:59,743	| IOT135 |	And it comes with an app so you can still integrate
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:03,327	| IOT135 |	In all that it's $150 it's on Indiegogo we should be very clear about that
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:07,423	| IOT135 |	It's a project on Indiegogo early bird special start at $99
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:13,823	| IOT135 |	The full retail for 1 days is going to be 150 any ideas that you might put one that's standing on your living room coffee table
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:17,151	| IOT135 |	Turn on your nightstand light mounted to a wall around your house
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:17,663	| IOT135 |	Because the intercom
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:18,943	| IOT135 |	So
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:24,575	| IOT135 |	There in fact are two versions of the desktop version it stands up and there's an in-wall version see if they can pick and choose and
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,343	| IOT135 |	Plan ahead on this
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,903	| IOT135 |	It's only 13% of it
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:29,183	| IOT135 |	$30,000
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:30,463	| IOT135 |	Flexible goal
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:36,863	| IOT135 |	So I say flexible because the campaign will get all the funds raised even if it doesn't reach its goal there's a month left
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:38,655	| IOT135 |	You want to think carefully before you backup
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,215	| IOT135 |	Even if they don't deliver the product they're getting them
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,751	| IOT135 |	Your money will go up in
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,031	| IOT135 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:45,567	| IOT135 |	Yay
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,847	| IOT135 |	Alright let's talk
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:49,151	| IOT135 |	Such enthusiasm from Stacy
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:51,199	| IOT135 |	I like sorry sorry guys I just
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,711	| IOT135 |	I'm not excited
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,015	| IOT135 |	But I am excited by now
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:55,295	| IOT135 |	So there we got we all have our
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,343	| IOT135 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:58,879	| IOT135 |	Security
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:00,159	| IOT135 |	Because by golly
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,695	| IOT135 |	There's a lot
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,487	| IOT135 |	Is here
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,255	| IOT135 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,535	| IOT135 |	The Reaper
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:10,399	| IOT135 |	Forget the song you should fear this Reaper
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:13,471	| IOT135 |	I think it's bigger than my right eye it is a
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:14,239	| IOT135 |	Botnet is
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,543	| IOT135 |	Everything
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,079	| IOT135 |	But it's
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,383	| IOT135 |	It's not good so this
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:23,455	| IOT135 |	It's got over 2 million it
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,735	| IOT135 |	Webcams so IP camera
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:28,063	| IOT135 |	And digital video recorders in the past
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,343	| IOT135 |	Month according to check
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:31,903	| IOT135 |	So it is growing faster than Boracay
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:33,183	| IOT135 |	And the
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,463	| IOT135 |	Concern is that these
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,487	| IOT135 |	Devices have enough
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:37,791	| IOT135 |	Computing power they have enough access to bandwidth
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:38,559	| IOT135 |	The date
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:40,095	| IOT135 |	Create a massive DDOS
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,143	| IOT135 |	And that was
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:44,703	| IOT135 |	Kind of the concern with Mariah
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,239	| IOT135 |	This is very
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,543	| IOT135 |	Similar only it's a little more advanced
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,311	| IOT135 |	Because
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:53,663	| IOT135 |	This thing can really it said it's like changing passwords and having
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:59,295	| IOT135 |	Control this can install additional software on these infected devices and we don't know what that's awful
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,063	| IOT135 |	4 can do
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:02,623	| IOT135 |	Depends on what the botnet controller
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,647	| IOT135 |	Wanted to do
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,415	| IOT135 |	This is very
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:06,719	| IOT135 |	Concerning perhaps more concerning than Mariah in my
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:07,999	| IOT135 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:10,047	| IOT135 |	Cuz you could actually reboot and then
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,327	| IOT135 |	Patch and then where I was
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,095	| IOT135 |	What's going on in
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,119	| IOT135 |	Can attack you
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:15,423	| IOT135 |	But here because it can actually install things
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:17,215	| IOT135 |	Run on that device
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,007	| IOT135 |	Netty persistent right
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:21,823	| IOT135 |	Thank you that's the word I was like they'll stay there even after it
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:28,991	| IOT135 |	So this is concerning and I would say it's concerning for two reasons one because it's
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:30,015	| IOT135 |	Could unleash
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:30,527	| IOT135 |	A massive amount
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,063	| IOT135 |	Bandwidth
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:34,111	| IOT135 |	Target but two
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,903	| IOT135 |	Because this is another thing that's going to
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:36,415	| IOT135 |	Tar and feather
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:42,559	| IOT135 |	Tea and these devices are old-school devices these are not the modern devices that we
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:43,839	| IOT135 |	We talked about so some of them
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,143	| IOT135 |	Passwords
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:47,167	| IOT135 |	We've got it all
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:50,751	| IOT135 |	Either not going to be updated over there or they're just
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:51,519	| IOT135 |	Out of service
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,079	| IOT135 |	These devices can be like 10
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:56,639	| IOT135 |	Years old so I think the more
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:57,407	| IOT135 |	Current modern
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:58,943	| IOT135 |	Companies are learning
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,223	| IOT135 |	From this but
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:02,527	| IOT135 |	I think that we still haven't actually in
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:07,135	| IOT135 |	Encountered a true iot attack yet that actually takes advantage of
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:08,415	| IOT135 |	United States
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,207	| IOT135 |	I feel like this attack
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:11,487	| IOT135 |	Yes it targets
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,279	| IOT135 |	Computing devices that are
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,559	| IOT135 |	Connected that are not actually
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:18,143	| IOT135 |	Computers but it is still very much in line with the old models of attacking
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,167	| IOT135 |	Computer system
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:21,727	| IOT135 |	I think we're going to start to Sea-Doo
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,495	| IOT135 |	Attacks
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:25,311	| IOT135 |	They're going to be aimed at true iot device
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:27,103	| IOT135 |	So sensors that light up
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,151	| IOT135 |	Other
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:29,919	| IOT135 |	Types of
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:31,199	| IOT135 |	The physical world attacks
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:32,223	| IOT135 |	I see again
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:33,503	| IOT135 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:35,807	| IOT135 |	Subwoofer like sound waves
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,343	| IOT135 |	Can disrupt your accelerometer
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:38,367	| IOT135 |	All of that it's going to be
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:39,391	| IOT135 |	Happening in
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:40,415	| IOT135 |	We're not even
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:45,279	| IOT135 |	Fear the Reaper the only thing I would add is
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:50,399	| IOT135 |	I think we're in a better place now because of what you just said those other devices are very old not to be patched
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:53,983	| IOT135 |	Yes we still have some issues with iot Device makers
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:57,567	| IOT135 |	Not offering security patches as quick as a cooler they should
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,335	| IOT135 |	But
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:19:59,103	| IOT135 |	Mostly
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:19:59,871	| IOT135 |	Are updatable
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:04,735	| IOT135 |	Pretty easily so we got that on our side it's just going to come down to
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:07,039	| IOT135 |	How quickly do these device makers react
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:08,319	| IOT135 |	Yes
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,087	| IOT135 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:10,367	| IOT135 |	So there's that
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:11,647	| IOT135 |	And then there's
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:13,951	| IOT135 |	A possible Solution on the horizon
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,999	| IOT135 |	So this is really interesting
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:16,767	| IOT135 |	Arm
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:21,119	| IOT135 |	I am actually here at arm techcon this week I gave a speech all about iot
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,399	| IOT135 |	Talk about some of the things
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,679	| IOT135 |	We always talk about on the
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:27,519	| IOT135 |	You guys remember that
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,823	| IOT135 |	But they introduced something called the
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:30,847	| IOT135 |	PS
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:32,639	| IOT135 |	And that stands
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,175	| IOT135 |	4 platform security
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:38,783	| IOT135 |	So this is really interesting because arm has gathered up
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:44,159	| IOT135 |	A bunch of big names in the industry it is basically saying we're going to Setzer
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:46,207	| IOT135 |	Things in place on the hardware
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,487	| IOT135 |	And then you guys
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:48,511	| IOT135 |	Here is a framework
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,279	| IOT135 |	For software developer
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:50,559	| IOT135 |	Work with
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,071	| IOT135 |	Our hearts
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:53,119	| IOT135 |	And that I think is going to
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,935	| IOT135 |	You can't what are the issues
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:21:00,031	| IOT135 |	We have right now is companies on the hardware side sell chips with
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,823	| IOT135 |	Like secure modules and all the school
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:05,663	| IOT135 |	Cool stuff in it but a lot of the companies don't actually turn it on
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:06,943	| IOT135 |	Know if they're working
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:08,223	| IOT135 |	Correctly
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:10,271	| IOT135 |	So this framework
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:10,783	| IOT135 |	Will address
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:16,416	| IOT135 |	Yeah that the smartest thing here is that are MS
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,720	| IOT135 |	Kind of using an open source
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,232	| IOT135 |	Firmware
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:21,280	| IOT135 |	Call trusted firmware m
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:24,864	| IOT135 |	And that's going to support this PSA specs so by doing that instead of making something
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,888	| IOT135 |	Proprietary
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:28,704	| IOT135 |	And sew on a it will allow people to contribute
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:30,240	| IOT135 |	Updates to that code
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,288	| IOT135 |	Theoretically make it better
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:35,360	| IOT135 |	And be it'll be easily usable by more
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:38,944	| IOT135 |	Company said that's what arm once I mean if they're expected to ship 200 billion chips
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:41,248	| IOT135 |	Spy I think it was 20 21
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,832	| IOT135 |	And Atman 200 billion chips running in
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:46,880	| IOT135 |	All kinds of computing devices but a lot of
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:48,672	| IOT135 |	Obviously smartphones and so on but
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:50,208	| IOT135 |	Tons and tons of little Iowa
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:51,232	| IOT135 |	Multi devices
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:53,024	| IOT135 |	You're interesting a wide base of
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:56,352	| IOT135 |	Product markets and you're making it easier to do so in a secure way
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:58,912	| IOT135 |	Which is awesome
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,448	| IOT135 |	We're excited
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:01,728	| IOT135 |	Bye
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:03,520	| IOT135 |	Farms PSA I hope this
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,056	| IOT135 |	Is it good step
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:06,336	| IOT135 |	Forward and
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,104	| IOT135 |	I guess
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:10,432	| IOT135 |	I feel like we talked about a lot of stuff Kevin do we have anything else we want to share
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:12,736	| IOT135 |	Do we want to take that listener
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:13,504	| IOT135 |	Voicemail
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:16,576	| IOT135 |	I do want to take a listener question Kevin and

EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:38,592	| IOT135 |	Their fruit
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:39,872	| IOT135 |	Tuscaloosa
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:40,896	| IOT135 |	You have permission to
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:42,688	| IOT135 |	Use this in your shower if you'd like
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:49,088	| IOT135 |	User iluv homekit but i've been looking at that new google pic
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,624	| IOT135 |	And I was wondering
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:52,160	| IOT135 |	Is there any
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:54,464	| IOT135 |	Phone or any other operating
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:58,816	| IOT135 |	System that integrates home automation into the actual ecos
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:00,864	| IOT135 |	Besides home
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,168	| IOT135 |	The Google assist
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,984	| IOT135 |	Or we'll have to have
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:06,496	| IOT135 |	A bunch of different
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:09,312	| IOT135 |	If you haven't asked us
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,336	| IOT135 |	Please let me know
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,360	| IOT135 |	Love the show
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,128	| IOT135 |	Love you guys
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:13,408	| IOT135 |	I'll let you know
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,456	| IOT135 |	Old Derek
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:17,504	| IOT135 |	We love this
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,272	| IOT135 |	Question
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,040	| IOT135 |	What because
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:20,064	| IOT135 |	The kind of fits into the easy
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:23,136	| IOT135 |	Although as always with our questions
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:24,672	| IOT135 |	The caveat
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:28,768	| IOT135 |	Your mileage may vary based on the devices you have
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,816	| IOT135 |	Change your comfort with technology
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:31,584	| IOT135 |	Which
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,864	| IOT135 |	It's basically a huge disc
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:35,936	| IOT135 |	What I was expecting to see when I saw that $20 cam
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,240	| IOT135 |	So all right
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:40,800	| IOT135 |	There is a lot of software out there
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:41,824	| IOT135 |	It won't do it
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:43,104	| IOT135 |	Exactly what
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:44,896	| IOT135 |	Home for iOS does
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:46,176	| IOT135 |	So if you want it
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:48,480	| IOT135 |	To be persistently available on the home
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:50,016	| IOT135 |	Home screen or what is that little tray that
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,296	| IOT135 |	On your iOS
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:53,088	| IOT135 |	Command Center
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:55,136	| IOT135 |	Is that okay yeah if you want it in the command center
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,464	| IOT135 |	But but
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,256	| IOT135 |	But it's
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:02,304	| IOT135 |	It's hard to answer the question without knowing
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:07,168	| IOT135 |	You know all the details of this system The Hub and so on and so forth but I use wink on my
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:10,496	| IOT135 |	Phones Derek with IOS and Android and
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:15,104	| IOT135 |	That is my central repository for controlling everything seeing the sensors and so on
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:20,224	| IOT135 |	It's certainly not as clean as home which I also have install oh I don't have a lot of homekit devices
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:22,272	| IOT135 |	One thing is lacking for simple there's no rooms
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:26,880	| IOT135 |	Like home has like home I can see what sensors are doing in different rooms and someone saved
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:28,416	| IOT135 |	What is very clean an nli
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:30,976	| IOT135 |	However if you have a SmartThings
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:31,744	| IOT135 |	Hub
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:33,536	| IOT135 |	Which would work with either iOS
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:34,304	| IOT135 |	Or with
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:38,144	| IOT135 |	Android they do have room support and I find the interface
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:38,912	| IOT135 |	Cleaner
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,936	| IOT135 |	Then Wing kits
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:41,472	| IOT135 |	Closer to what home offers
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:46,080	| IOT135 |	Again if you don't have a SmartThings Hub it's at the obviously not going to help you sound like you
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,104	| IOT135 |	You can use it with other hub
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:51,712	| IOT135 |	Please have you seen anything any third-party type things that just suck everything in like this
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:53,248	| IOT135 |	So there are some
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,784	| IOT135 |	And their limitations
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:56,576	| IOT135 |	So I've mentioned one before called
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,344	| IOT135 |	You know me
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,112	| IOT135 |	I don't
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:59,136	| IOT135 |	No I don't
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,160	| IOT135 |	Thanks.
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:00,928	| IOT135 |	It has
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:04,256	| IOT135 |	Was kind of the room support that you would be looking for the ability to control it
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:08,096	| IOT135 |	From a nap there is however a company that used to be called Alfred smart
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,656	| IOT135 |	Comedy called Gideon
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,424	| IOT135 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:12,960	| IOT135 |	So you can download this app on
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:14,240	| IOT135 |	And
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:16,032	| IOT135 |	It has the room capabilities
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:18,336	| IOT135 |	You can create scenarios
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,128	| IOT135 |	Controller
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:21,664	| IOT135 |	Huge variety devices
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:23,712	| IOT135 |	But in some cases you're going to have
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,480	| IOT135 |	Have to have the Hub
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:25,248	| IOT135 |	Select
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:26,528	| IOT135 |	Controls a bunch of insteon devices
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,320	| IOT135 |	For that work you're going to have to have the in
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:30,112	| IOT135 |	It controls
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:30,880	| IOT135 |	WeMo devices
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,416	| IOT135 |	You don't have to have
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:33,952	| IOT135 |	So it's got nest
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:35,232	| IOT135 |	Set Philips Hue with
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:37,792	| IOT135 |	That Apple gear but not all the nits out
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,304	| IOT135 |	Ogier
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,584	| IOT135 |	Sonos
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,352	| IOT135 |	It will control
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:42,656	| IOT135 |	Pink stuff tp-link gear
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:44,704	| IOT135 |	It actually control some of the week stuff
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:45,984	| IOT135 |	Through the wink hub
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:47,008	| IOT135 |	So it's
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:49,568	| IOT135 |	Pretty promising I tried it last
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:50,592	| IOT135 |	Probably about a year ago
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:51,872	| IOT135 |	And
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:55,200	| IOT135 |	It works the interface was different than what it looks like now but I can
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:57,760	| IOT135 |	Kind of expect that because he was newer in a little
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:59,296	| IOT135 |	Funky but it did do the
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,832	| IOT135 |	Controlling there was a little latency
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:03,392	| IOT135 |	But I would also ask you
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,416	| IOT135 |	Why do you want
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:04,928	| IOT135 |	What to do this
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:10,048	| IOT135 |	In them not trying to be a jerk but I really try very hard
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,072	| IOT135 |	Did not pick up
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,144	| IOT135 |	And I do that thing
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:14,912	| IOT135 |	Things to do
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:15,680	| IOT135 |	Amazon Echo or the
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:17,216	| IOT135 |	The home and that is
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:19,008	| IOT135 |	I feel like I use an app
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,312	| IOT135 |	You know maybe one out of every two
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:21,824	| IOT135 |	20 *
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:25,920	| IOT135 |	And I I totally I get your point
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:30,272	| IOT135 |	Say hi to in defensive Maybe by Derek might want to do this when I look at the whole map
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:35,648	| IOT135 |	I get information it's not just about control maybe I want to see what the temperature is upstairs without having to speak
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:37,952	| IOT135 |	Or walk upstairs or so on so forth
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:40,000	| IOT135 |	It's just right there like I'm looking
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:40,512	| IOT135 |	At the Home app
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:44,352	| IOT135 |	Occupancy detected you know when the dining room well that's obviously my dog
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:48,960	| IOT135 |	We probably shouldn't be on the dining room table I can see the heat down there the heat up here the temperature and so on
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,752	| IOT135 |	It's like Ike story
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:53,568	| IOT135 |	Get that it's the getting of information
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,080	| IOT135 |	As well as
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:56,896	| IOT135 |	Got it okay well now I understand
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:27:00,224	| IOT135 |	And now I say Gideon will offer you some of that in
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,576	| IOT135 |	Yes on a
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:05,856	| IOT135 |	Semi-related note
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,392	| IOT135 |	What I think
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:12,256	| IOT135 |	Andy Rubin essential is promising is something like this when the essential Home Products come out
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:16,864	| IOT135 |	Because he just wants to apparently make it all seem listen pollen
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:19,168	| IOT135 |	One repository one app and so on
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:23,008	| IOT135 |	I haven't heard anything about that I do have an essential phone being delivered today
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:24,032	| IOT135 |	I'm going to see if they have any
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:26,336	| IOT135 |	Smart home software included in that as well but
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:27,360	| IOT135 |	That's something to keep an eye out
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:31,968	| IOT135 |	Yeah I'm excited about I know the essential phone was a bit of a bus but I am a
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:32,480	| IOT135 |	Excited about
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:34,784	| IOT135 |	And hope those are still
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:39,904	| IOT135 |	It's less of a bus now they dropped the price $200 that's why I bought one
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:41,440	| IOT135 |	Go Kevin always on the prowl for
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:43,232	| IOT135 |	All right
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:48,096	| IOT135 |	I feel like that was a really good show and we should pause here
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:49,120	| IOT135 |	Take a break
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:53,472	| IOT135 |	And then come back with our guests feel Skipper who is the head of iot

EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:08,736	| IOT135 |	Working on two really interesting area
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:09,504	| IOT135 |	One of them is
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:11,808	| IOT135 |	Connected vehicles and in that space
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,088	| IOT135 |	We're really seeing the
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:14,112	| IOT135 |	Continue
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:17,696	| IOT135 |	Conductivity doll all the cars in the Telco.
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:19,232	| IOT135 |	Where they are offering
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:20,768	| IOT135 |	What we called the OBD
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:25,376	| IOT135 |	Uncle Phil making any existing cars that is still on the road
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:28,704	| IOT135 |	Today connected with an OBD dongcopter going to have a great
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:34,080	| IOT135 |	Company called muccio presenting how's that working with FTP and really offering
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:34,848	| IOT135 |	Today's
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:37,408	| IOT135 |	Which is the T-Mobile offering
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,688	| IOT135 |	Which is powered by

EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:11,264	| IOT135 |	It has to do with it
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:22,784	| IOT135 |	Revolution
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:25,600	| IOT135 |	Okay and now you guys for your particular Network
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:26,880	| IOT135 |	Market shows in NB iot
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:28,928	| IOT135 |	Why did you guys choose that over
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,488	| IOT135 |	We spend alone time
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:37,632	| IOT135 |	Elope a lovely weekend in the NBA
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:47,104	| IOT135 |	Penetration very low battery life
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:50,432	| IOT135 |	Witches NPR cheeks
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:53,248	| IOT135 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:54,016	| IOT135 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:03,744	| IOT135 |	I need China it's a big Market
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:09,632	| IOT135 |	Rechargeable
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:11,424	| IOT135 |	Convergys
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:13,984	| IOT135 |	He has like
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:15,264	| IOT135 |	A very low data rate
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:17,312	| IOT135 |	Which I'm wondering if
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,592	| IOT135 |	America picked
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,360	| IOT135 |	Cat m
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:21,152	| IOT135 |	Because we're like gluttons for bandwidth
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:24,480	| IOT135 |	What about things like when we talk about over the air updates
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:25,248	| IOT135 |	And
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:26,528	| IOT135 |	Those sorts of needs
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:28,576	| IOT135 |	Do we need something
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:29,856	| IOT135 |	Better
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:30,368	| IOT135 |	In terms of
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:32,416	| IOT135 |	I think it's in the US
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:34,976	| IOT135 |	Knetbooks
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:44,192	| IOT135 |	Preseason football
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:45,984	| IOT135 |	You don't actually need to get
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:50,848	| IOT135 |	Information
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:52,896	| IOT135 |	Traditionally used to things like
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:58,528	| IOT135 |	Go to launch detection environmental monitoring
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:08,512	| IOT135 |	I choose Joy
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:13,888	| IOT135 |	Security technology
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:16,448	| IOT135 |	Okay so
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:19,776	| IOT135 |	Let's talk about this idea of convergence because I am
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:22,080	| IOT135 |	Very curious what you mean when you mentioned
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:26,432	| IOT135 |	And nb-iot conversion into some sort
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:28,736	| IOT135 |	Single standard or wheat
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:35,904	| IOT135 |	I think it's
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:42,816	| IOT135 |	Angel Food Network
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:35:04,064	| IOT135 |	I think she might well see these things becoming similar
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:08,160	| IOT135 |	I think you'll see them become
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:11,488	| IOT135 |	Let's talk about some of your
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:12,768	| IOT135 |	Connected device
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:13,280	| IOT135 |	Use case
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:14,816	| IOT135 |	Spitter using
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:16,096	| IOT135 |	Either end
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:17,888	| IOT135 |	I don't know something even fancy
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:34,528	| IOT135 |	Connect to call and internet services
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:36,064	| IOT135 |	Tiny devices that you might use
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:42,464	| IOT135 |	Chinese inventions
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:45,024	| IOT135 |	Use cases
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:48,608	| IOT135 |	The interesting
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:49,632	| IOT135 |	How
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:50,144	| IOT135 |	The
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:05,248	| IOT135 |	Technology wings
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:06,528	| IOT135 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:08,832	| IOT135 |	Because
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:10,112	| IOT135 |	I saw an article
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:14,720	| IOT135 |	Talk about the module cost in
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:18,816	| IOT135 |	I believe it was someone from Vodafone that was actually saying the module costs are not low enough
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:20,864	| IOT135 |	So I'm very curious
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,400	| IOT135 |	When does it become economically
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:25,216	| IOT135 |	To actually put this in more
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:25,728	| IOT135 |	Places
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:32,384	| IOT135 |	How much money is January
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:42,624	| IOT135 |	Don't have the power to do it
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:51,584	| IOT135 |	When you start looking at
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:55,680	| IOT135 |	Applications
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:57,472	| IOT135 |	Something small tracking devices
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:06,432	| IOT135 |	Cheering in Chinese
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:07,456	| IOT135 |	Caldwell
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:17,440	| IOT135 |	Applications come to Market
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:27,424	| IOT135 |	Actually
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:36,384	| IOT135 |	That you're going to see come out today
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:39,712	| IOT135 |	Cuz what we're seeing
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:40,224	| IOT135 |	Today is
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:42,016	| IOT135 |	Mostly Subs
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:43,296	| IOT135 |	Corruption based beak
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:44,320	| IOT135 |	Has bee stings have
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:46,112	| IOT135 |	I think that's because that's how
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:48,416	| IOT135 |	Consumers and even businesses are used to
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:59,936	| IOT135 |	The Simpsons that I did not see where the chips
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:05,056	| IOT135 |	Windows being broken
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:06,080	| IOT135 |	Spell baby baby
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:07,872	| IOT135 |	To replace
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:09,408	| IOT135 |	I think when you looked at
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:14,528	| IOT135 |	Look for instance asymptotic changing value
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:18,112	| IOT135 |	When something goes something
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:27,584	| IOT135 |	It's going to cost you a few hundred pounds
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:28,352	| IOT135 |	Looks like
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:31,680	| IOT135 |	It's at that point that you can charge the device
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:35,520	| IOT135 |	So wishing momotose where the hardware
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:36,800	| IOT135 |	Where is Stitches
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:40,384	| IOT135 |	Is the initial value so you think of the customer list of connected
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:48,320	| IOT135 |	Places to call
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:53,440	| IOT135 |	Animal Collective
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:55,744	| IOT135 |	Election monitoring TV event
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:57,536	| IOT135 |	Or the outcome
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:01,120	| IOT135 |	Okay that's kind of
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:05,216	| IOT135 |	So in that case payment comes to you
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:06,496	| IOT135 |	From the glass maker
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:10,592	| IOT135 |	Let me tell somebody
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:11,616	| IOT135 |	And that is like
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,552	| IOT135 |	It's at that point where
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:22,880	| IOT135 |	Tavares High
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:36,192	| IOT135 |	Stolen vehicle tracking
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:38,240	| IOT135 |	If you can get called stolen
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:44,384	| IOT135 |	Luggage being stolen is of no use having it returned to you
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:50,016	| IOT135 |	Used to be hot
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:56,672	| IOT135 |	Totally see where you're going in that makes a lot more sense
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:59,232	| IOT135 |	Pay a monthly fee for a glass break sensor
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:01,024	| IOT135 |	Cuz once it's broken I'm like
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:02,048	| IOT135 |	That was my security okay
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:03,584	| IOT135 |	Here we go do you think
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:05,376	| IOT135 |	Consumers are going to start
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,656	| IOT135 |	Ending up with
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:10,496	| IOT135 |	And of course
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:16,896	| IOT135 |	Everyday to the way we operate
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:22,528	| IOT135 |	Looking at something where you'll give me action
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:28,672	| IOT135 |	Whether he wants
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:31,744	| IOT135 |	That becomes much easier to manage
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:33,024	| IOT135 |	I think
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:33,792	| IOT135 |	It will be
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:43,264	| IOT135 |	Psychiatrist being sent back
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:45,056	| IOT135 |	The television show
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:46,336	| IOT135 |	I think it's your care
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:49,152	| IOT135 |	Reading Country Club
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:52,736	| IOT135 |	I know customers privacy
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:53,504	| IOT135 |	Everyone benefits
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:58,624	| IOT135 |	Disagree with that I just feel like there's always a lot of community
EDL	00:40:58,624	00:40:59,392	| IOT135 |	Location
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:01,696	| IOT135 |	And you touched on security which is something
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:03,744	| IOT135 |	I think license pants
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:04,768	| IOT135 |	Generally have
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:05,792	| IOT135 |	A little bit more of
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:06,560	| IOT135 |	Sandisfield
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:09,376	| IOT135 |	So talk to me about how you guys are
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:11,936	| IOT135 |	The connectivity in the network
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:12,960	| IOT135 |	Also the
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:17,312	| IOT135 |	Customer data on the backend like what role do you play in
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:34,464	| IOT135 |	Something like
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:38,304	| IOT135 |	Volume teachmore
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:41,376	| IOT135 |	Security
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:41,888	| IOT135 |	Cool business
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:46,752	| IOT135 |	Skills
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:50,592	| IOT135 |	We get the economy
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:54,431	| IOT135 |	Escaping security
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:56,991	| IOT135 |	Because security something you have to invest in
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:05,951	| IOT135 |	2 into a number
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:07,231	| IOT135 |	So how do you make the device
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:09,791	| IOT135 |	People
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:13,375	| IOT135 |	How to make sure that the taking out knees or something else
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:19,007	| IOT135 |	Turn on network
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:23,871	| IOT135 |	Insecure
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:30,015	| IOT135 |	Ability to use different techniques that we use to secure that piping
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:59,711	| IOT135 |	Large complicated system
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:08,671	| IOT135 |	Control over the conditions
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:17,631	| IOT135 |	Unemployment insurance
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:20,703	| IOT135 |	Distributed
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:21,983	| IOT135 |	So if I'm buying
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:25,823	| IOT135 |	Connectivity it sounds like I have to keep everything
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:31,967	| IOT135 |	Your world so if I am on AWS
EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:34,271	| IOT135 |	A different Cloud platform provider
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:35,551	| IOT135 |	Chant
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:44,511	| IOT135 |	Will it rain July 6th I do today wsj

EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:58,335	| IOT135 |	Coyotes in ecosystem play
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:44:00,127	| IOT135 |	Security
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:03,455	| IOT135 |	Okay let's go back to this window maker
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:06,015	| IOT135 |	Because I feel like there are a lot of really
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:11,647	| IOT135 |	Technically Savvy folks like the AWS guys like you guys
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:12,159	| IOT135 |	In the it
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:15,487	| IOT135 |	Now we bring in this window maker who's like
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:17,023	| IOT135 |	I have one at this module
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:19,583	| IOT135 |	Concrete this other line of business which sounds awesome
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,607	| IOT135 |	But then let's say
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:21,631	| IOT135 |	Maybe it's
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:23,423	| IOT135 |	Processor inside
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:23,935	| IOT135 |	The censored
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:25,215	| IOT135 |	Broken dick
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:27,519	| IOT135 |	Gets hacked so there's an element inside
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:28,543	| IOT135 |	Window sensor
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:30,079	| IOT135 |	It gets packed
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:30,847	| IOT135 |	Vulnerable
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:33,663	| IOT135 |	You guys might see this long before the window maker
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:34,943	| IOT135 |	Probably isn't
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:36,735	| IOT135 |	Sword
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:38,783	| IOT135 |	I'm not saying they shouldn't
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:39,551	| IOT135 |	But they probably are
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:41,599	| IOT135 |	So what is the role
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:42,367	| IOT135 |	As
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:43,903	| IOT135 |	Technology expands in the
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:44,927	| IOT135 |	More places with
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:46,463	| IOT135 |	People who are maybe not Azteca
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:47,231	| IOT135 |	Wasabi
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:47,999	| IOT135 |	For a company like
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:57,471	| IOT135 |	Windows
EDL	00:44:57,471	00:45:01,311	| IOT135 |	Looking off the remote sensor
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:10,271	| IOT135 |	Usage
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:11,551	| IOT135 |	See
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:20,511	| IOT135 |	Information that you can use on
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:22,303	| IOT135 |	I'll be able to come
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:28,703	| IOT135 |	I said Managed IT provider
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:31,775	| IOT135 |	The network
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:34,079	| IOT135 |	So we can just avoid him to be input
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:36,383	| IOT135 |	Centerpieces prices that he wants too long
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:40,479	| IOT135 |	Existing
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:43,551	| IOT135 |	Our customers
EDL	00:45:44,575	00:45:46,111	| IOT135 |	Into that if you like
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:48,671	| IOT135 |	A lot of people are like hey the most accurate
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:49,951	| IOT135 |	Will be to build it
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:52,511	| IOT135 |	Ourselves and then there was this Evolution were there like
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:53,535	| IOT135 |	Oh that was a dumb idea
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:55,583	| IOT135 |	Let's not build ourselves as good as somebody else
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:59,679	| IOT135 |	But now it feels like
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:01,215	| IOT135 |	They still want to monitor
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:05,311	| IOT135 |	Set data so is this just a continual Evolution back to the egg
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:07,871	| IOT135 |	Do you think there's
EDL	00:46:07,871	00:46:08,639	| IOT135 |	I don't know
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:10,175	| IOT135 |	It feels like it's not
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:11,455	| IOT135 |	Not many people are doing it.
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:13,759	| IOT135 |	Depends on
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:16,063	| IOT135 |	YouTube
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:22,975	| IOT135 |	The large multinational
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:25,279	| IOT135 |	Unable to manage those connections
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:26,047	| IOT135 |	Galaxy 7
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:30,655	| IOT135 |	With all platforms they cannot change location
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:34,495	| IOT135 |	And see everything that is actually happening
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:40,127	| IOT135 |	Simpsons people that might be making connected clothing
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:44,223	| IOT135 |	Do not have
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:47,295	| IOT135 |	Coming back into the business
EDL	00:46:54,719	00:46:58,815	| IOT135 |	The company that makes the jacket work you have to have service centers around the world
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:02,143	| IOT135 |	We have been servicing to alarms
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:03,935	| IOT135 |	Depends on
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:12,639	| IOT135 |	Dissimilar
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:15,199	| IOT135 |	Businesses
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:16,735	| IOT135 |	Production orientation
EDL	00:47:16,735	00:47:20,319	| IOT135 |	Babies quite a large market for these are your team
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:25,439	| IOT135 |	Barometer
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:25,951	| IOT135 |	Raleigh
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:27,743	| IOT135 |	What was most interesting
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:33,375	| IOT135 |	People are deploying iot Solutions
EDL	00:47:33,375	00:47:33,887	| IOT135 |	WhatsApp
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:37,983	| IOT135 |	1
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:39,007	| IOT135 |	Number of
EDL	00:47:39,007	00:47:41,055	| IOT135 |	Organizations with y'all
EDL	00:47:41,055	00:47:45,151	| IOT135 |	Actually increasing the sky right now
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:51,295	| IOT135 |	A good indication that people seem to benefit
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:55,135	| IOT135 |	The second one
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:57,439	| IOT135 |	Changes in
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:59,231	| IOT135 |	The perception around security
EDL	00:48:00,255	00:48:03,071	| IOT135 |	Example
EDL	00:48:03,583	00:48:06,655	| IOT135 |	Security
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:08,959	| IOT135 |	We understand how to resolve it
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:10,751	| IOT135 |	I don't think that means
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:14,847	| IOT135 |	She sang we know that security
EDL	00:48:17,663	00:48:20,735	| IOT135 |	With that you would keep the understanding
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:26,623	| IOT135 |	Ready
EDL	00:48:27,135	00:48:32,255	| IOT135 |	How customers are increasing the volume
EDL	00:48:32,255	00:48:33,791	| IOT135 |	How to become insecure
EDL	00:48:34,303	00:48:38,143	| IOT135 |	All right we turn this whole conversation but we haven't actually talked about
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:38,655	| IOT135 |	Threat
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:41,983	| IOT135 |	Unlicensed or the rule of unlicensed
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:42,751	| IOT135 |	Low-power wide area
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:46,591	| IOT135 |	Parks and I've got to ask you because I hear a lot of companies are deploying
EDL	00:48:47,103	00:48:47,871	| IOT135 |	Network
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:49,151	| IOT135 |	Works especially inside there
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:51,711	| IOT135 |	Encana creating this
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:52,991	| IOT135 |	Private low power
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:55,551	| IOT135 |	What is your thought about
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:57,343	| IOT135 |	Laura there sick Fox
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:48:58,623	| IOT135 |	Subway
EDL	00:49:02,975	00:49:04,255	| IOT135 |	Wide area network
EDL	00:49:04,255	00:49:06,559	| IOT135 |	These nuts
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:16,031	| IOT135 |	Are you already saying that with some of the deportment shavings
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:23,199	| IOT135 |	2g or NB iot
EDL	00:49:24,991	00:49:31,135	| IOT135 |	Will coexist in the same way
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:36,767	| IOT135 |	Now carriers have been working now for the last
EDL	00:49:36,767	00:49:37,279	| IOT135 |	Gosh
EDL	00:49:37,791	00:49:38,815	| IOT135 |	I want to say almost a decade
EDL	00:49:39,327	00:49:41,375	| IOT135 |	I started reporting about you no like
EDL	00:49:41,375	00:49:42,143	| IOT135 |	The carriers
EDL	00:49:42,143	00:49:42,911	| IOT135 |	Wi-Fi app
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:46,495	| IOT135 |	And they're definitely strategies
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:47,007	| IOT135 |	5G coming
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:50,335	| IOT135 |	What kind of blend licensed and unlicensed together
EDL	00:49:52,383	00:49:53,407	| IOT135 |	Seamless
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:54,431	| IOT135 |	Consumer Packaging
EDL	00:49:54,431	00:49:57,503	| IOT135 |	So is that what you see happening with some of these
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:58,015	| IOT135 |	Is unlicensed
EDL	00:49:58,527	00:49:59,039	| IOT135 |	Low power
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:02,623	| IOT135 |	Yeah I think you just too
EDL	00:50:02,623	00:50:03,647	| IOT135 |	So how do you say
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:21,823	| IOT135 |	What you'll come down to me it's not necessarily the technology
EDL	00:50:23,103	00:50:25,151	| IOT135 |	Konosuba Syracuse that you got
EDL	00:50:25,151	00:50:26,687	| IOT135 |	Where you can get it
EDL	00:50:26,687	00:50:29,247	| IOT135 |	Under the security that comes with the offer
EDL	00:50:29,247	00:50:33,855	| IOT135 |	Service-based differentiation
EDL	00:50:33,855	00:50:35,647	| IOT135 |	It will be around technology
EDL	00:50:35,647	00:50:37,439	| IOT135 |	I think that sums up the iot
EDL	00:50:38,719	00:50:39,999	| IOT135 |	It's service it's your work clothes
EDL	00:50:41,279	00:50:41,791	| IOT135 |	Technology is
EDL	00:50:43,327	00:50:44,095	| IOT135 |	All right
EDL	00:50:44,095	00:50:45,631	| IOT135 |	Thank you so much
