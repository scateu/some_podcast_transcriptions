EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:02,368	| IOT142 |	Let's talk about the death of yet another
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:02,880	| IOT142 |	Roddick
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:05,184	| IOT142 |	We got an email this week from one of our listeners
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:08,000	| IOT142 |	He writes us to tell us that
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,536	| IOT142 |	A company called
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,304	| IOT142 |	Mogio
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:12,608	| IOT142 |	Canadian company that made
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:15,168	| IOT142 |	On board diagnostics
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:16,192	| IOT142 |	Port products
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:20,544	| IOT142 |	So that's like automatic you shoved this into your car attracts things like mileage rate
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:21,568	| IOT142 |	Are you are you
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:22,080	| IOT142 |	You can tie it into
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,360	| IOT142 |	Like channels like if
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:24,896	| IOT142 |	And track
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:29,504	| IOT142 |	I actually think it's kind of a cool thing to track your mileage to a spreadsheet if your
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:32,320	| IOT142 |	Driving a car around for business purposes
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:35,136	| IOT142 |	This company
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:37,184	| IOT142 |	Put out their product back in November of 2014
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,720	| IOT142 |	But
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:41,280	| IOT142 |	End of January the generation
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:43,584	| IOT142 |	1 Mojo device
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:45,120	| IOT142 |	It's not going to be supported anymore
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:48,704	| IOT142 |	Kevington upset because
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:51,264	| IOT142 |	This is not a very long
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,800	| IOT142 |	Life cycle for a product
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:57,664	| IOT142 |	Such as this because it's not like the pores have changed on the vehicles number one and number two
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:58,944	| IOT142 |	This was one of the
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:01,760	| IOT142 |	First state was the first was one of the first
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:05,088	| IOT142 |	Modules that had built in 3G and GPS connectivity
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:08,672	| IOT142 |	And that hasn't changed so
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,464	| IOT142 |	What's changed
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,744	| IOT142 |	Well it gets a little bit better
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:18,144	| IOT142 |	Apparently in the email it says they've said we carefully ensure that every customer on first generation products
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,424	| IOT142 |	Has received a minimum of
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:21,216	| IOT142 |	12 months of service
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:24,032	| IOT142 |	This is a device that cost $150
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:24,800	| IOT142 |	And
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:26,336	| IOT142 |	How does subscription fee
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:29,920	| IOT142 |	Your poor the cellular connectivity so this is a device that
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:32,224	| IOT142 |	You know in some place did it alright they
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:34,528	| IOT142 |	Accounted for the cost of
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:36,320	| IOT142 |	You know sending data and
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:40,672	| IOT142 |	Hardware cost that was actually fairly expensive I think the original automatic was
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,440	| IOT142 |	Like 99
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,464	| IOT142 |	Cellular one is more
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:43,744	| IOT142 |	And
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:47,072	| IOT142 |	Yeah here's the thing this reminds me
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,376	| IOT142 |	Of like a smartphone that you might replace
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:50,912	| IOT142 |	The fact that this only lasted about three years
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:55,520	| IOT142 |	A car is the typically a longer-term investment it's not like you
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:04:01,920	| IOT142 |	Recycle through cars like smart phones in most cases the second thing is it's not like a cellular technology has changed
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,944	| IOT142 |	They had
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:04,992	| IOT142 |	Produced this device with a
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:09,856	| IOT142 |	Say a 2G chips that you know and those networks are shutting down as we transition
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,904	| IOT142 |	The Operators you know moving forward
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:15,232	| IOT142 |	LTE 5G Etc then I can sort of understand it
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:15,744	| IOT142 |	But
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,791	| IOT142 |	That hasn't happened so
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:20,607	| IOT142 |	Why I still wonder why
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:23,167	| IOT142 |	This is no longer going to work and there's no
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:24,447	| IOT142 |	Valid reason in my mind
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:27,263	| IOT142 |	Here's what they say
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:33,663	| IOT142 |	They say the first generation OBD2 devices
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,943	| IOT142 |	Incapable of communicating
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:38,783	| IOT142 |	And because of the way they've been manufactured we cannot
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,063	| IOT142 |	Install alternate SIM cards
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:48,767	| IOT142 |	Changed the could be and we should probably know that they have kind of changed their business model overtime as well
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:53,119	| IOT142 |	After this product came out to basic create a product and let the carriers white label it
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:59,519	| IOT142 |	So you could go to in fact they mentioned that you may we recommend if you know
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,543	| IOT142 |	I forget what it is but
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:02,847	| IOT142 |	So it seems like they're getting out of the Direct business
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,639	| IOT142 |	What's the direct-to-consumer
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:09,503	| IOT142 |	This is this is another example of what
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,271	| IOT142 |	We talk about when we talk
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:13,343	| IOT142 |	Talk about it looks like perhaps these guys
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,135	| IOT142 |	When they launched this in 2014
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,927	| IOT142 |	They probably didn't think ahead about life
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:18,207	| IOT142 |	Like what happens if we pivot
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,231	| IOT142 |	What happens if
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:19,743	| IOT142 |	This doesn't
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:25,631	| IOT142 |	And I think any company that's launching a connected product needs to have those contingency
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:26,911	| IOT142 |	Hanson Place
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:29,983	| IOT142 |	And it would suck to have to use them but you should still have
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:31,775	| IOT142 |	And
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:33,567	| IOT142 |	Communicate that to the customer so
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:36,895	| IOT142 |	It's only words you're going to hear a lot more about this
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:37,919	| IOT142 |	The year ahead
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,991	| IOT142 |	Because it's a topic we strongly believe in
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,271	| IOT142 |	Very propensity
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,343	| IOT142 |	And I think we're going to see a lot of other companies hit the wall
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,135	| IOT142 |	It's going to become an issue
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,415	| IOT142 |	So
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:48,927	| IOT142 |	Psy
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,487	| IOT142 |	Let's move away
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:53,535	| IOT142 |	Consumer for a moment and let's talk about
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:55,839	| IOT142 |	Iot in industrial setting
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,375	| IOT142 |	Cuz
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,399	| IOT142 |	I did a field trip
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,679	| IOT142 |	2
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,959	| IOT142 |	Well it was a distillation
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:06,335	| IOT142 |	Not whiskey distillation but like Refinery distillation and it was a little pilot plant that
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,871	| IOT142 |	The University of Texas has on
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,663	| IOT142 |	Their campuses
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,175	| IOT142 |	And
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:12,479	| IOT142 |	I went just to kind of learned
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,247	| IOT142 |	And see
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:15,551	| IOT142 |	Connected sensors in action and I learned a lot
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:17,343	| IOT142 |	Cool stuff but the coolest thing I learned
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:18,623	| IOT142 |	Was
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:21,951	| IOT142 |	The challenges of Wireless in industrial environment
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,743	| IOT142 |	I said I did put this in my newsletter so if
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,511	| IOT142 |	If you read this forgive me
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,047	| IOT142 |	That was cool
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:29,631	| IOT142 |	So can I talk to you from Emerson was telling me that in
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:33,727	| IOT142 |	The initial setups things like trains and trucks that are
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,519	| IOT142 |	Moving into load up
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,311	| IOT142 |	Refined product
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,847	| IOT142 |	They would stop the wireless
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:40,383	| IOT142 |	Signals to the RF environment
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,407	| IOT142 |	Is super challenging there
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:45,503	| IOT142 |	One because it changes in the release large metal objects moving
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,807	| IOT142 |	But it's also changing
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,575	| IOT142 |	As the
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:51,647	| IOT142 |	Chemicals inside these giant metal Vats
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:55,999	| IOT142 |	Go up and down so as things are refined the volume inside changes
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:59,327	| IOT142 |	And Wireless in water They Don't Really mix so that causes
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,607	| IOT142 |	Problems
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,655	| IOT142 |	There were talking about like why mesh needs to be
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,215	| IOT142 |	Why mesh Wireless needed to be
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:05,727	| IOT142 |	Be created for the
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,519	| IOT142 |	And
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:11,103	| IOT142 |	I just thought as companies are starting to roll out
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,639	| IOT142 |	More Wireless
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:14,687	| IOT142 |	Networks things like Laura
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,967	| IOT142 |	Things like sigfox
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:16,735	| IOT142 |	In there
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:20,575	| IOT142 |	Maybe not why does industrial but he didn't like a warehouse in Bayern
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:23,135	| IOT142 |	Some of these things are still going to be the same
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,671	| IOT142 |	You're still going to need to answer
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:25,439	| IOT142 |	To those problems
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,463	| IOT142 |	So
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:31,327	| IOT142 |	It is pretty cool at me we sit around our homes and complain that we can't get
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:36,959	| IOT142 |	Wi-Fi signal in a room you know but even when nothing is moving and changing dynamically in a warehouse I mean yeah
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:38,239	| IOT142 |	I can't wear production facility
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,287	| IOT142 |	All the movement of things I can
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:43,359	| IOT142 |	Affect wireless signals never thought of that to be honest
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:45,407	| IOT142 |	That's going to be half the investment tool
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,967	| IOT142 |	Change out from older generation
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:51,039	| IOT142 |	Wireless networks to new mesh networks or whatever solution they use but
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:52,831	| IOT142 |	I think they're going to have to do that
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:57,695	| IOT142 |	Well yeah and if you think about things like robots right those are usually metal and they're going to be moved
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:58,975	| IOT142 |	Around so
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,743	| IOT142 |	Woohoo
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:03,839	| IOT142 |	It's going to be a challenge the other challenge with mash that we should mention briefly
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,375	| IOT142 |	Is that when you
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:11,775	| IOT142 |	Install a mesh Network unless you're working with like a standardized thing like these Wi-Fi mesh networks there's no standardized wife
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,543	| IOT142 |	Imesh
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,823	| IOT142 |	So what we get
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:14,591	| IOT142 |	Is
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:19,455	| IOT142 |	Proprietary just going to say semi proprietary it's like there
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:22,015	| IOT142 |	Proprietary implementations of a standard
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,783	| IOT142 |	Is what it really is
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:26,623	| IOT142 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,159	| IOT142 |	Sync
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:28,671	| IOT142 |	Head
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:31,743	| IOT142 |	Industrial mesh for
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,511	| IOT142 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,535	| IOT142 |	Bluetooth is working on
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:37,119	| IOT142 |	Yeah it just to clarify
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:39,167	| IOT142 |	I'm sure people understand but for a few who may not
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,191	| IOT142 |	What you mean
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:45,567	| IOT142 |	Liquor my own perspective is like I can't take a Nero and attach it to my Google Wi-Fi mesh for example and vice versa
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,103	| IOT142 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:50,943	| IOT142 |	They all still speak Wi-Fi but to each other to create the match they're using their own
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,735	| IOT142 |	Software
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:53,759	| IOT142 |	Maybe that should be stand
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:59,391	| IOT142 |	Get the best out of Cheyenne Gilgamesh Network around the entire planet
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,231	| IOT142 |	All right
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,047	| IOT142 |	Also industrial news
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,863	| IOT142 |	I did I found an inch
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:11,935	| IOT142 |	Interesting article from an MIT Sloan management review
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:16,799	| IOT142 |	I thought there'd be more data in there an unfortunate wasn't but there was some very interesting information
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,823	| IOT142 |	What's a good cover
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:21,919	| IOT142 |	It has to do with facilities management and IRT so semi related to our last story
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,223	| IOT142 |	They took a look at some of the
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:26,783	| IOT142 |	Data that has been collected from large
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,831	| IOT142 |	Commercial buildings and Facilities over decade
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:35,743	| IOT142 |	And figured out that these places spend about a hundred billion dollars each year just a repair and Main
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:36,767	| IOT142 |	It's work right
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:37,791	| IOT142 |	The thing is
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,327	| IOT142 |	What they're saying is hey you know what
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:42,143	| IOT142 |	If we could use iot devices shenzhen AI
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,935	| IOT142 |	To Ghana
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:50,079	| IOT142 |	Figure out in advance what might need to be maintained what my break down and said we could actually reduce unnecessary Maiden
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:52,639	| IOT142 |	By about 20 to 25%
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:59,039	| IOT142 |	And that adds up I mean if it is a hundred billion dollars and you can achieve that returns 20 25%
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:03,647	| IOT142 |	$10 a year save just by using iot limitations in these facilities so
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:05,183	| IOT142 |	Rather interesting when you put in that respect
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:08,767	| IOT142 |	Yeah we care a lot about preventive or predictive maintenance
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:12,351	| IOT142 |	Which is about to break down quick
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,119	| IOT142 |	Fix it first
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:15,935	| IOT142 |	What we don't talk a lot about and what
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,983	| IOT142 |	These case studies don't cover is
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:21,311	| IOT142 |	A lot of maintenance is just routine and set based on
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:23,615	| IOT142 |	Every 5,000 miles you should get your
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:27,199	| IOT142 |	What this element is is
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:27,967	| IOT142 |	Hey
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:34,367	| IOT142 |	It's been 5000 miles but you know everything still humming along so why don't you just wait a little bit longer so this is
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,391	| IOT142 |	It's preventing me
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,159	| IOT142 |	It's so it's proven
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,439	| IOT142 |	It's not predictive it
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:38,719	| IOT142 |	Preventing
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,231	| IOT142 |	Preventative
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:47,423	| IOT142 |	Yes yeah I mean instead of using just guidelines General guidelines which is kind of the way we had to do it
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:48,191	| IOT142 |	Before we had
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:48,959	| IOT142 |	Big Data
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:53,823	| IOT142 |	You know saying cars like the present but yet you always do the 3000-mile oil change and tire rotation cetera but
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:58,943	| IOT142 |	People drive in different areas people have different weather patterns people have different road conditions
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:03,295	| IOT142 |	So you maybe it'll go 5-6 8000 Miles to the guidelines kind of irrelevant
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,319	| IOT142 |	When you have the data
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:10,975	| IOT142 |	Discount on individual-level weather person or a facility's plant or whatever it maybe now you can actually not spin
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,767	| IOT142 |	Minutes money when you don't need to
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:14,815	| IOT142 |	All right
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,583	| IOT142 |	Now
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,119	| IOT142 |	We're going deep into the nerd hole
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:20,703	| IOT142 |	It's so worth it
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,263	| IOT142 |	Ivan old Shepard
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:24,799	| IOT142 |	Kevin is
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,847	| IOT142 |	You're not old but
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,383	| IOT142 |	You previously
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:28,895	| IOT142 |	Kids
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,223	| IOT142 |	20 years ago
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:40,671	| IOT142 |	And I've always been fascinated by this because to me are underlying silicon and Hardware
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:43,487	| IOT142 |	Are the parameters for what we can really do
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,767	| IOT142 |	And I know software is eating
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:48,351	| IOT142 |	The world and it's awesome but it's still constrained by the
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,119	| IOT142 |	Capability for soft
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:52,703	| IOT142 |	And one of the challenges with software is power consumption
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,471	| IOT142 |	So I have been
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,519	| IOT142 |	Constantly fascinated by
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,287	| IOT142 |	The ways
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,567	| IOT142 |	Companies try to
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,335	| IOT142 |	Reduce
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,103	| IOT142 |	Power consumption
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,919	| IOT142 |	And I just read this article I linked to it
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:03,455	| IOT142 |	On a startup called
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,991	| IOT142 |	Minima it's out of Finland
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,295	| IOT142 |	And they're doing
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:07,807	| IOT142 |	Okay guys
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:11,135	| IOT142 |	They're doing near threshold voltage
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:15,999	| IOT142 |	This is kind of weird but basically you got a little electric current running around on any semi
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,279	| IOT142 |	Are any transistor that
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,327	| IOT142 |	Right
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:21,375	| IOT142 |	And you want to make sure
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:24,191	| IOT142 |	They usually run at a higher level so you can make sure it
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:25,471	| IOT142 |	Completes the circuit
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:25,983	| IOT142 |	Candidate against
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,031	| IOT142 |	What this does is it
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,799	| IOT142 |	It takes it
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,079	| IOT142 |	Is low to the ground is pause
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,359	| IOT142 |	And
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,639	| IOT142 |	They basically
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,663	| IOT142 |	Will modify
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:35,455	| IOT142 |	The performance
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,735	| IOT142 |	So how much
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:38,783	| IOT142 |	Electricity is shoved through the chip
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:39,295	| IOT142 |	Based on
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:40,575	| IOT142 |	Performance team
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,135	| IOT142 |	So they can get away with a little bit they do
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,695	| IOT142 |	So these chips are becoming smarter
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:47,487	| IOT142 |	And reducing the power
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:47,999	| IOT142 |	Consumption
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,791	| IOT142 |	So that's what it does
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:53,119	| IOT142 |	There other companies such as ambach micro which I have covered since
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:56,703	| IOT142 |	I want to say like 2012 or 2011
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,495	| IOT142 |	I have left this come
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:01,823	| IOT142 |	And edit compute and they're also working
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,615	| IOT142 |	With low voltage
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:08,479	| IOT142 |	So I think this is a really cool concept so this is how we're going to
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:11,551	| IOT142 |	Continue pushing forward with chip design and capabilities
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:13,599	| IOT142 |	While also reducing
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:16,671	| IOT142 |	Our needs and being very custom to the job
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:17,183	| IOT142 |	Things are trying
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:23,583	| IOT142 |	Yeah I sent her saying it just to give a frame of reference Huawei mrs. noted in the article but it jumped out at me
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:29,727	| IOT142 |	Huawei actually uses ambucs microcontrollers right now and they get 21 days on a single battery charge now
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:32,287	| IOT142 |	Granted maybe doesn't color screens
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:33,567	| IOT142 |	There are other aspects
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:34,847	| IOT142 |	Contribute to that
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,127	| IOT142 |	But
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:40,223	| IOT142 |	You compare that to a traditional say a smartwatch or other wearable in my last a day or two
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:43,551	| IOT142 |	Free sample right because it doesn't use the low threshold
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:46,623	| IOT142 |	And last week actually profiled a company called spire
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:48,415	| IOT142 |	And they make a
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,439	| IOT142 |	Stick on
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:51,743	| IOT142 |	Health tracker it'll go on sale in January
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:54,303	| IOT142 |	Where I said this is a activity tracker tracks
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,839	| IOT142 |	Heartbeat respiration
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:57,631	| IOT142 |	Sleep
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,911	| IOT142 |	It's a sticker
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:01,983	| IOT142 |	And you peel it off and you stick it in your underwear and you can wash it
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:04,287	| IOT142 |	And it just stays there and works for
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,311	| IOT142 |	Two solid
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,079	| IOT142 |	They're using
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:07,871	| IOT142 |	Micro can
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:11,199	| IOT142 |	That's a 2-year battery life on a device that
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,967	| IOT142 |	You actually can
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:13,759	| IOT142 |	I think it's crazy
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:17,855	| IOT142 |	And it's always on and always on it
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:18,623	| IOT142 |	Something right now
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,159	| IOT142 |	What's crazy is
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:22,207	| IOT142 |	Waking up in sending that data some
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,231	| IOT142 |	Now there's no screen on
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:25,279	| IOT142 |	Which is a huge

EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:26,815	| IOT142 |	Screen
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,095	| IOT142 |	Like nobody's business
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:31,423	| IOT142 |	But waking up a radio to send that data and processing that
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,703	| IOT142 |	Is just insane
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:34,495	| IOT142 |	Hello
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:38,335	| IOT142 |	That's the future and so we need these types of companies because
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,359	| IOT142 |	Otherwise
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:42,175	| IOT142 |	We're going to be like charging everything in sight forever
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:42,687	| IOT142 |	And that's a
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:45,247	| IOT142 |	Now it's time for
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:46,527	| IOT142 |	Are some rapid fire news
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:51,647	| IOT142 |	IDC has said that Global spending on iot will grow 14.6
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,927	| IOT142 |	Percent next year
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:58,559	| IOT142 |	And they think it's going to hit 770 2.5 billion dollars
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,887	| IOT142 |	They're going to assume that by
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:02,911	| IOT142 |	20/20
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,679	| IOT142 |	Iot
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:06,751	| IOT142 |	Spending is going to be at a trillion dollars
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,799	| IOT142 |	That is insane
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:11,871	| IOT142 |	They also think that most of the money in the beginning is going to go towards
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,151	| IOT142 |	Ace Hardware
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,431	| IOT142 |	Modules and sensors
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:16,223	| IOT142 |	How long is spending on infrastructure
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:16,735	| IOT142 |	Security
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:19,551	| IOT142 |	Services will follow hardware and then some
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,087	| IOT142 |	Which makes
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:26,463	| IOT142 |	Might be worth noting also that the industries that they see the spending manufacturers
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:28,255	| IOT142 |	Slated to spend the most in transfer
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:30,047	| IOT142 |	Rotation and utilities
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:32,351	| IOT142 |	And then you find consumer
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:38,751	| IOT142 |	Iot spending which is interesting so I focus so much on consumer that often forget it's really a smaller part of this
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:40,543	| IOT142 |	Big pie
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:46,687	| IOT142 |	Did you say that by 2021 more than 55% of the spending and iot projects will be
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:49,247	| IOT142 |	Before software so if you're starting your company today
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:50,015	| IOT142 |	Software y'all
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:51,039	| IOT142 |	Software
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:55,647	| IOT142 |	Alright in other news a french company called atos has offered to buy gemalto
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,415	| IOT142 |	Four Points
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,951	| IOT142 |	3 billion euros
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:16:04,351	| IOT142 |	Gemalto is a company that makes SIM cards payment chips there inside things like your passport
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,375	| IOT142 |	Credit cards
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:07,935	| IOT142 |	They made the Nano Sims 4 like
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,447	| IOT142 |	IPad.
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:15,103	| IOT142 |	That was cool they make the Eastern actually for the Apple watch and possibly the pixel phones as well
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:17,407	| IOT142 |	Yeah so this gives atos
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:24,319	| IOT142 |	Hunk and payments and security and sim cards for the iot and since iot is so hot they are so
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,623	| IOT142 |	They want to get in on
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,927	| IOT142 |	5 billion dollar offer
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:31,999	| IOT142 |	That's that
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,303	| IOT142 |	Oh yes
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:40,191	| IOT142 |	We don't get to talk about honking that much because there haven't been as many devices are supported but there is anyone
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:42,239	| IOT142 |	I didn't see Honeywell lyric
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,263	| IOT142 |	Controller
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:47,615	| IOT142 |	This is not like the lyric thermostat this is the actual controller panel that
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,919	| IOT142 |	I think you have to have this one professionally installed
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:52,223	| IOT142 |	I'm almost positive you can tell me if I'm wrong on that one
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:57,087	| IOT142 |	But it does have homekit support now as of December 7th
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:17:00,415	| IOT142 |	Yes this is their security stuff I think it even speaks with Oprah
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:02,975	| IOT142 |	Proprietary Wireless thing so this is kind of a gateway to talk to them
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,023	| IOT142 |	Proprietary Honeywell security
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:06,047	| IOT142 |	Except which is
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,583	| IOT142 |	Indeed
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,119	| IOT142 |	All right Google Assistant
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,911	| IOT142 |	Now supports device sync
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:11,935	| IOT142 |	My voice
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:13,215	| IOT142 |	There's not much to say here
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:16,543	| IOT142 |	Well
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,311	| IOT142 |	What is device sync
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:18,335	| IOT142 |	Some people may not
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:24,991	| IOT142 |	Understand what that means when you're adding devices to your smart home hub or a digital assistant usually have to go in and out
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,527	| IOT142 |	War II
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:28,319	| IOT142 |	Just a link accounts on a server
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:33,695	| IOT142 |	Now what you can do with Google Assistant once you to add something to your smart home hub a new product for example
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:37,535	| IOT142 |	You can just say to your Google Assistant hey sync my lights cuz you just had a new lights
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:42,399	| IOT142 |	It'll just do it automatically you don't have to go into the app or anything like that so
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,935	| IOT142 |	Little less of an obstacle to do that
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,215	| IOT142 |	It
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,495	| IOT142 |	Next Step
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:50,079	| IOT142 |	You can wake up to music on your Echo just by simply saying that
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:51,615	| IOT142 |	Set my alarm for 6 a.m.
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,407	| IOT142 |	Beyonce
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:18:01,087	| IOT142 |	Recurring you can choose from different music services such as Amazon music Spotify Pandora TuneIn
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:02,367	| IOT142 |	Sirius XM
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:04,671	| IOT142 |	One of my favorites cuz the Beatles Channel and iHeartRadio
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:13,119	| IOT142 |	I can just get blinds to show me the sun on the cheap I've been good shape
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:16,959	| IOT142 |	Well that brings us to my neck
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,983	| IOT142 |	Topic which is
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:19,519	| IOT142 |	I finally installed
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:21,567	| IOT142 |	The Ikea tradfri
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:25,151	| IOT142 |	I just like to say it
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:25,663	| IOT142 |	It is fun to
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,199	| IOT142 |	So
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:28,735	| IOT142 |	I had a botched initial pack
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:30,527	| IOT142 |	So this took me awhile and
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,551	| IOT142 |	And I replaced it
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:36,671	| IOT142 |	And now have them so the one thing I liked about the Caesar $80 from
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:38,975	| IOT142 |	Ikea the setup requires a hub
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:42,815	| IOT142 |	It has a remote control and then to light bulbs and they're white tunable
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,375	| IOT142 |	It does work with Madam a
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,167	| IOT142 |	And it also works with
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:50,239	| IOT142 |	So those are the things you need to know about
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:54,335	| IOT142 |	Now when I installed it I love the fact that I did not have
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:54,847	| IOT142 |	Have to sign up
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:57,151	| IOT142 |	There was no app
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:59,711	| IOT142 |	There isn't a doubt you have to install that I didn't have to
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:01,247	| IOT142 |	The password I didn't have to
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:02,527	| IOT142 |	To do anything
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,319	| IOT142 |	Just just
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:08,671	| IOT142 |	Took a picture of his very much like the homekit setup I took a picture of the device in the back
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:11,231	| IOT142 |	Your phone's on this network this is on this network
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:13,023	| IOT142 |	I've now authenticated this to this
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:16,607	| IOT142 |	It's a very localized non cloud-based
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,119	| IOT142 |	Solution
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,447	| IOT142 |	Yes but there is a hub so I know
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:26,335	| IOT142 |	It's okay I setup the remote control
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:29,407	| IOT142 |	Sitting at very close to the Gateway and saying
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:30,431	| IOT142 |	Connect
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,455	| IOT142 |	And then
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:33,503	| IOT142 |	That's how you add light bulbs to stick
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,807	| IOT142 |	Light bulbs into the socket and then you
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:36,575	| IOT142 |	All the remote
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:37,599	| IOT142 |	Control next to them
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,623	| IOT142 |	And
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,391	| IOT142 |	It all worked
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,159	| IOT142 |	Pretty flawlessly
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,207	| IOT142 |	My challenge
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:45,279	| IOT142 |	Is now that I have enabled the echo skill
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:47,839	| IOT142 |	And have that working it recognizes
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,607	| IOT142 |	One of them
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,631	| IOT142 |	And turns it off
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,655	| IOT142 |	But it doesn't
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,423	| IOT142 |	Recognize
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:55,007	| IOT142 |	And it shows both in your Madam a app
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:57,823	| IOT142 |	Yes but one is glowing and lit up
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:00,127	| IOT142 |	The other one is not and when I go to it
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,407	| IOT142 |	I can turn it off
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:01,919	| IOT142 |	From Adam
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:04,479	| IOT142 |	It just says it doesn't recognize that
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,247	| IOT142 |	Set device name
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:07,551	| IOT142 |	Which is weird cuz it's the same device name
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:10,879	| IOT142 |	That the outlet that lamp was originally plugged into was
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:11,903	| IOT142 |	HEB
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,695	| IOT142 |	So I'm still troubleshooting
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:15,231	| IOT142 |	Can be exciting
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,511	| IOT142 |	I wonder if
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:19,327	| IOT142 |	If you use a different device name as a temporary
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:23,423	| IOT142 |	Just to see maybe there's some confusion there with the reusing an old device name
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:26,239	| IOT142 |	So that was my initial thought but I rebooted
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:30,335	| IOT142 |	So I put these in our bedside tables
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,615	| IOT142 |	Lamp so I replaced
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:33,407	| IOT142 |	A hue light bulb called Stacy
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,967	| IOT142 |	With a Tri-C light bulbs now
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:36,735	| IOT142 |	Call Stacy
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:38,271	| IOT142 |	I rename my hue light bulb
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,295	| IOT142 |	Anna for my daughter
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:42,879	| IOT142 |	And then I took
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:44,159	| IOT142 |	A WeMo Outlet
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:46,207	| IOT142 |	It's called Andrew that his lamp
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:48,767	| IOT142 |	Plugged into and I replaced it with a bulb
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:49,791	| IOT142 |	The tribe people
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:51,071	| IOT142 |	Called Andrew
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,863	| IOT142 |	And I named the new outlet
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:53,375	| IOT142 |	Christmas tree
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:54,655	| IOT142 |	Because my Christmas tree

EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:08,991	| IOT142 |	Just out of curiosity does it work with the home app or do you guys not have any iOS devices
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:12,319	| IOT142 |	My husband has an iOS device but making him
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:12,831	| IOT142 |	Play with the homie
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,208	| IOT142 |	Then he should not have a lightbulb
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:22,816	| IOT142 |	Next week
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,352	| IOT142 |	Will find out
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,632	| IOT142 |	What happened
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,400	| IOT142 |	What went wrong

EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:25,536	| IOT142 |	Fabulous podcast co-host I work with
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:29,888	| IOT142 |	I received a ring doorbell Pro as an early Christmas gift
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:30,912	| IOT142 |	Thank you Stacey
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:31,680	| IOT142 |	And
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:34,752	| IOT142 |	And before we hit our
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:41,152	| IOT142 |	12 degree windshield weather today I went out yesterday and when was a little warmer and installed being new
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:42,176	| IOT142 |	Ring doorbell
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:44,480	| IOT142 |	It was it was easy to install like this is
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:46,528	| IOT142 |	I think very simple for most people to do
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:49,600	| IOT142 |	I had a challenge in that my doorbell transformer
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,880	| IOT142 |	From my old doorbell
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,160	| IOT142 |	Is literally attached
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:54,720	| IOT142 |	To the very top of my circuit panel downstairs
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:56,768	| IOT142 |	There's no breaker for it
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:58,304	| IOT142 |	It just seems like it's just attached
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:01,376	| IOT142 |	And so I'm like
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,912	| IOT142 |	I'm not to be able to turn off the power
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:04,704	| IOT142 |	But it's low voltage
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:06,752	| IOT142 |	I didn't even once crossed any wires or shock mice
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:08,032	| IOT142 |	No problem
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:08,544	| IOT142 |	So
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:10,848	| IOT142 |	Ring includes two little
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:15,456	| IOT142 |	What should I call the little jumper so to speak or do you have to go into your current doorbell and
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:21,600	| IOT142 |	Attach the wires to the jumpers and a little ring box that they include very simple to do did that
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:25,184	| IOT142 |	Took off the old doorbell put in the new ring attached to wires
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:30,560	| IOT142 |	Perfect getting power to the app and set it up
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:31,840	| IOT142 |	So far so good
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:37,472	| IOT142 |	This literally took me about 30 minutes and I said part of that time looking for the breaker to turn off power so
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:39,264	| IOT142 |	Not a lengthy process
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:43,616	| IOT142 |	However when I got through the setup process with the doorbell
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:50,016	| IOT142 |	And it wanted to connect to my wireless network which I use a Google Wi-Fi that's actually an old onhub and one
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:51,040	| IOT142 |	Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,064	| IOT142 |	Am I nice Network
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:55,136	| IOT142 |	It said it was connecting to or connected to my
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:24:00,512	| IOT142 |	Network and as soon as it got connected I could use the app I couldn't do a lot of you I couldn't do anything other than
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,280	| IOT142 |	Ring the doorbell
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:04,096	| IOT142 |	This is weird why can I not connect to you
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:10,496	| IOT142 |	You said you were connected and in the actors that device health button and you click that you can see the power when I had more than
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:12,800	| IOT142 |	Power coming into that was not a problem
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:16,128	| IOT142 |	But just sitting at work offline and like what are you talkin about
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:20,224	| IOT142 |	So I spent more time than it took to actually install the thing to figure it out
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:22,272	| IOT142 |	And that was
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:25,088	| IOT142 |	My home network name has a special character in it
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:30,464	| IOT142 |	As a hyphen and I probably don't need the hyphen I had it in there from way back when I used to run multiple Networks
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:32,768	| IOT142 |	What I would name my network on the put a hyphen
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:34,560	| IOT142 |	Jeor -
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:35,328	| IOT142 |	And
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:37,376	| IOT142 |	Bryson a fool my different
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:38,400	| IOT142 |	Bands
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,424	| IOT142 |	Don't need to do that anymore
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:47,104	| IOT142 |	So what I did instead of changing my home network name which would host of about 25 different devices right now
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:53,248	| IOT142 |	Exactly I got creative and remembered oh I already have a guest network setup on this Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:55,040	| IOT142 |	And it's just a regular
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,576	| IOT142 |	Network name no special characters
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:58,112	| IOT142 |	Let's see if that works
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:00,416	| IOT142 |	Sure nuff it does
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:02,208	| IOT142 |	It kind of bothers me
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:04,256	| IOT142 |	Now that I have all this work
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,280	| IOT142 |	Cloud before it gets too
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,608	| IOT142 |	It's not Nino
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,120	| IOT142 |	No
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:11,168	| IOT142 |	No it's not going to the club
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:11,936	| IOT142 |	When your doorbell rings
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:15,264	| IOT142 |	And it's going to
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:17,568	| IOT142 |	Put your phone instead of going over the Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,592	| IOT142 |	Because they're not on the same
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,896	| IOT142 |	Network but they sorta are
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:25,760	| IOT142 |	I checked the seven head and the IP addresses and the way Google does this it's
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:27,040	| IOT142 |	The guest Network
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:27,808	| IOT142 |	Is
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:30,368	| IOT142 |	I want to see the same network cuz it's not but
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,904	| IOT142 |	It looks like it is
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:33,440	| IOT142 |	It's very interesting out there done it
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:37,024	| IOT142 |	I'll have to dig into a little bit more but I'm not seeing any issues or I can still
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:43,936	| IOT142 |	Access things when I go my guess what I can access my printer and so on so regardless Reddit
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:45,728	| IOT142 |	It said it soon as I got rid of my special character at work
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:48,032	| IOT142 |	And that's why I did it as a workaround
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:49,824	| IOT142 |	But the thing is
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,616	| IOT142 |	Rings troubleshooting for this
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,640	| IOT142 |	It's like okay
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:55,200	| IOT142 |	Connect to that Network on your phone and do a speed test
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:59,808	| IOT142 |	And is it more than one megabyte per second yeah it's 150 megabits per second
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,600	| IOT142 |	And I tested that multiple times
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:03,648	| IOT142 |	There should be something in the troubleshooting
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,416	| IOT142 |	Texas
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:10,560	| IOT142 |	Make sure you don't have special characters in your home network name because for some reason it doesn't like that
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,072	| IOT142 |	So
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:14,144	| IOT142 |	Seafood please
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:20,288	| IOT142 |	If I'm wrong and I just got lucky with the Yes Network and that's not the real issue with special characters let me know what
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,568	| IOT142 |	If it is I think
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,848	| IOT142 |	Yeah the app
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:23,872	| IOT142 |	Troubleshooting music
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:27,200	| IOT142 |	Excellent regardless of all at once it's working
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:27,968	| IOT142 |	It's working great
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:30,016	| IOT142 |	I set up motion zones and
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:36,928	| IOT142 |	I told Stacy before the show we have a side unit townhouse so people to walk around the actual front and come around the
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:38,464	| IOT142 |	Side front entrance
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,744	| IOT142 |	And there's a long walk way and
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:44,352	| IOT142 |	And I can see them as soon as they make that corner and I'm like hey 10 steps before they even ring the doorbell
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:46,400	| IOT142 |	I get an alert right now it is awesome

EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:04,992	| IOT142 |	In the apartment above me and I came home
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:09,600	| IOT142 |	And like there was a stream of water that could feel like a 50 gallon trash can
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,904	| IOT142 |	Like every 5 minutes just
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:12,928	| IOT142 |	Pouring down into my mouth
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:14,720	| IOT142 |	It was sex

EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:32,384	| IOT142 |	Because it has a long tail as a 4-foot
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:35,456	| IOT142 |	Cord that you can actually string a couple of them together
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:36,736	| IOT142 |	And
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:40,320	| IOT142 |	You can wrap that around your pipes and it will detect if they're going to fry
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:46,464	| IOT142 |	Fries so as they get close to freezing it'll let you know and if it bursts or there is a leak somewhere around there
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:52,864	| IOT142 |	It will also let you know so I love those because they're Wi-Fi so they don't require anything special and they do temperature
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:53,632	| IOT142 |	And we
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:54,400	| IOT142 |	Detection
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,680	| IOT142 |	Undertale gives you a
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,448	| IOT142 |	A lot more surface area
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:59,264	| IOT142 |	So that's probably a great option
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,288	| IOT142 |	Now
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:03,104	| IOT142 |	The downside for that is
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:06,176	| IOT142 |	You got it like when you get the alert you're going to be like oh
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,968	| IOT142 |	Oh crap not going to drive down to my office
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:10,528	| IOT142 |	So what's really interesting
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:13,088	| IOT142 |	When are some of the things coming out so their products from a
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:14,624	| IOT142 |	Call Finn
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,648	| IOT142 |	Spin out from Belkin
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:17,696	| IOT142 |	They're actually tracking
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:20,512	| IOT142 |	Weeks at the water valve and
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:23,072	| IOT142 |	The cool thing there is there going to be
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:24,352	| IOT142 |	Looking for
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,632	| IOT142 |	Weeks anywhere in your
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:27,680	| IOT142 |	Basically so you don't have to actually rap any
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:34,080	| IOT142 |	And that's going to be an algorithm that says oh my gosh you're is a lot of water and it appears to be coming from your
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:35,872	| IOT142 |	So those are cool
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:38,176	| IOT142 |	The most advanced seems to be a company called
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:41,504	| IOT142 |	Slow and what this does is it has that kind of algorithmic
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:42,272	| IOT142 |	Detection
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,040	| IOT142 |	Like Finn
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:44,832	| IOT142 |	But then it also
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:45,856	| IOT142 |	Can shut off the water
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:47,392	| IOT142 |	When a leak occurs
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:50,208	| IOT142 |	So if it sees a major leak in water
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:51,488	| IOT142 |	Going through the system
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:52,768	| IOT142 |	It's like oh no
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:53,536	| IOT142 |	And then
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:54,048	| IOT142 |	Atlas shut off the
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:56,096	| IOT142 |	Internet Sandy
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:58,912	| IOT142 |	Those are really excited there's a lot of shut-off valves happening
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,960	| IOT142 |	So you could create like a
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:02,752	| IOT142 |	Take your Honeywell and then happy
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,032	| IOT142 |	Water valve connector
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:05,824	| IOT142 |	True like a gift but
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:07,616	| IOT142 |	Honestly for something is important
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,640	| IOT142 |	I kind of wanted to
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:12,992	| IOT142 |	Yeah it's got the functionality to
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:14,784	| IOT142 |	Shut the water slow down
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:20,928	| IOT142 |	Either at the main or whatever the week is that's actually very very useful I did well with paying a premium for my opinion
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:24,000	| IOT142 |	A lot of these though I'm going to tell you you have to get them installed
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:24,512	| IOT142 |	Professionally
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:27,072	| IOT142 |	You're going to be messing with
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:28,864	| IOT142 |	Which
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:34,496	| IOT142 |	Yeah but the for the basics the lyric is only 7999
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:37,312	| IOT142 |	Yeah and that is does the freeze detection as well which is actually
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:40,128	| IOT142 |	This time of year here in the USA that's a good thing
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,688	| IOT142 |	Exactly and there's tons of leak sensor
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,968	| IOT142 |	They're so like every
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:44,736	| IOT142 |	Smart home platform
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:48,832	| IOT142 |	When there's SmartThings has one root which makes a
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,112	| IOT142 |	Smoke detector
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:56,256	| IOT142 |	After 2 they have won the challenge with those that I don't love not all of them do freezes roosters dufur
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:31:00,096	| IOT142 |	But they're also just like one tiny little sensor that
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:02,144	| IOT142 |	You stick next to something and you just hope the league
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:05,728	| IOT142 |	That's the thing standpoint
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:09,056	| IOT142 |	That's like you got to decide in advance where the leak is going to happen
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:10,592	| IOT142 |	I don't like that
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:13,664	| IOT142 |	No I don't like that either my
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:15,712	| IOT142 |	Apartment situation back in college you know
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:16,992	| IOT142 |	I don't have access to some
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:18,272	| IOT142 |	House of Hair
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:20,832	| IOT142 |	A lot of these would be really interesting in things like
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:21,344	| IOT142 |	Multi-family dwelling
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:23,136	| IOT142 |	Because
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:24,672	| IOT142 |	Of like what I just described
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,208	| IOT142 |	And they don't want
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:30,816	| IOT142 |	Denise that may have been more information
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:33,632	| IOT142 |	Honeywell if you just want a quick leak sensor in rap
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:34,400	| IOT142 |	Your pipes
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:35,168	| IOT142 |	Or
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:36,704	| IOT142 |	You can go and Vance
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:41,568	| IOT142 |	And put a flow system on that tracks all the water usage in your building and then can shut
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:42,336	| IOT142 |	It Off
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,872	| IOT142 |	So if you
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:44,384	| IOT142 |	I have a question

EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:29,696	| IOT142 |	Hey everyone we are interrupting this week's podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is flux
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:31,232	| IOT142 |	Products and I have robbed
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:33,536	| IOT142 |	Here to talk about
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:35,584	| IOT142 |	Is Kono smart thermostat
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:36,096	| IOT142 |	End
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:37,120	| IOT142 |	Cool design feature
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:39,424	| IOT142 |	Hey Rob thanks for joining us
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:41,472	| IOT142 |	Can you start by quickly telling us
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:41,984	| IOT142 |	What it is
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:44,288	| IOT142 |	We are a
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:47,104	| IOT142 |	Trout philadelphia-based innovator of HVAC
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:47,872	| IOT142 |	Controls
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:50,432	| IOT142 |	And as you mentioned our newest product in the market is
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:54,016	| IOT142 |	Is the Lux Kono smart thermostat which has all the features
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:54,784	| IOT142 |	You can imagine
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:33:00,160	| IOT142 |	And some more I hope we get to talk about a hundred and forty-nine bucks at your local Home Depot store or of course he
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:01,184	| IOT142 |	You can shop online
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:01,952	| IOT142 |	Excellent
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:04,256	| IOT142 |	So the first thing I noticed was that
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:07,840	| IOT142 |	There were a bunch of different options for me to change out the faceplate
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:08,608	| IOT142 |	On this thing
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:10,144	| IOT142 |	Can you tell me a little bit more about
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:14,752	| IOT142 |	We believe in personalization out-of-the-box are
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:17,056	| IOT142 |	Decor snap cover what we call them
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:18,592	| IOT142 |	Is in a great black
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,616	| IOT142 |	Stainless steel
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:21,152	| IOT142 |	Color which is very popular right
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:24,992	| IOT142 |	But as you know people decorate differently their walls look different
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:28,576	| IOT142 |	They might want to match something or contrast with something
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:29,088	| IOT142 |	You think so we have
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:30,880	| IOT142 |	A bunch of other apps
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:32,928	| IOT142 |	Since we have a hibiscus Red Sea
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:34,720	| IOT142 |	Deep Blue
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:36,768	| IOT142 |	Of course we have a black and a white
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:37,280	| IOT142 |	And as you mention
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:38,560	| IOT142 |	You paint it
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:39,840	| IOT142 |	So when you're
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,120	| IOT142 |	Spending all that money
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:43,168	| IOT142 |	Dressing up your living room and
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:44,448	| IOT142 |	Changing the colors
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:45,472	| IOT142 |	You can now
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:50,848	| IOT142 |	Customize your own thermostat with large of course not covered where you can have your kids draw something nice
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:51,616	| IOT142 |	What other designer
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:53,408	| IOT142 |	Taken to consider
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:54,176	| IOT142 |	Duration
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:56,992	| IOT142 |	If you look at the product you can't help but notice it has
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:58,016	| IOT142 |	It's great big
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:59,808	| IOT142 |	Brushed aluminum knob on it
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:03,136	| IOT142 |	And that's the control knob that's how you get into the user interface
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:05,184	| IOT142 |	How you make the thermostat warmer
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:05,696	| IOT142 |	And cooler
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:07,488	| IOT142 |	Very easy to use
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,792	| IOT142 |	It's part of the reason why we came up with the
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:11,328	| IOT142 |	Ancona because when you
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:12,608	| IOT142 |	You see it you're going to want to touch it
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:15,424	| IOT142 |	So I love that you're focused on design in person
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:17,216	| IOT142 |	Ization what other features have
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:17,728	| IOT142 |	You built into
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,008	| IOT142 |	It has
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:20,032	| IOT142 |	A lot of smart
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:22,336	| IOT142 |	Teacher so works with all the three major voices
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:23,616	| IOT142 |	Assistance Apple
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:24,640	| IOT142 |	Amazon
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,664	| IOT142 |	And Google
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:27,456	| IOT142 |	It also has geofence
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:30,016	| IOT142 |	Sing we call that home-and-away aware and
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:36,416	| IOT142 |	We also have something for IAQ indoor air quality so there's a lot of different built-in features that work through
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:37,696	| IOT142 |	Through the app and through the storm
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:40,256	| IOT142 |	Thermostat to make it an excellent entry point
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:41,536	| IOT142 |	For any Smart Home
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:43,584	| IOT142 |	Can you tell me a little bit more about IQ
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:46,656	| IOT142 |	We have a long history of understanding the need to
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:47,424	| IOT142 |	Remove air
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:48,448	| IOT142 |	Sew weave
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:51,776	| IOT142 |	Come up with a product we also call are smart IQ
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:53,824	| IOT142 |	We connect with a third party
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:54,848	| IOT142 |	Air sensor
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:57,664	| IOT142 |	And when it detects a pollution event
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:35:00,480	| IOT142 |	It'll through the cloud to Cloud integration
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:03,040	| IOT142 |	Tell our thermostat to turn the air on
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,320	| IOT142 |	And automatically you have
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:09,440	| IOT142 |	IAQ event we will circulate the air through your filter and through your air quality system
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:10,976	| IOT142 |	Something awesome
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:12,256	| IOT142 |	Where can we go to find out
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:18,144	| IOT142 |	You can stop by your local Home Depot store or you can go online Deluxe products.com
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:23,520	| IOT142 |	Of course you can shop online and learn more about the Kono smart thermostat
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:35,552	| IOT142 |	Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:36,320	| IOT142 |	Is Nick
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:39,904	| IOT142 |	Langston who is in business development for
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,696	| IOT142 |	TE Connectivity
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:42,464	| IOT142 |	HD
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:42,976	| IOT142 |	We're talking
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:44,000	| IOT142 |	Outsmart
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:46,304	| IOT142 |	Hey dick how are you doing
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:48,864	| IOT142 |	Hey Stacy I'm doing great how are you
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:53,472	| IOT142 |	And I am super excited we have had this conversation I feel like over a year ago
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:55,520	| IOT142 |	You got to come on the show and talk about this
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:56,800	| IOT142 |	It just did
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:57,824	| IOT142 |	Open until
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:35:59,616	| IOT142 |	Better late than never
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:02,688	| IOT142 |	Exactly I feel like by waiting a little bit longer
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:04,224	| IOT142 |	We just come that much further
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:07,552	| IOT142 |	We're talking about smart Fabrics today
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:11,136	| IOT142 |	So explain to me what these are what this entails
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:12,160	| IOT142 |	Where We Are Tour
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:13,952	| IOT142 |	The definition of smart
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:16,000	| IOT142 |	Probably depends a little bit on
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:16,768	| IOT142 |	Who you're talkin
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:18,816	| IOT142 |	But I like to think of it as
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:21,376	| IOT142 |	Sensors embedded into
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,144	| IOT142 |	Fabrics
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:23,168	| IOT142 |	There's also a place
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:24,192	| IOT142 |	We're just delivering
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:24,960	| IOT142 |	Power
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:25,728	| IOT142 |	Ortygia
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:29,056	| IOT142 |	Through Fabrics but I really like to think of it is textile based
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:31,360	| IOT142 |	Sensors used for biometrics
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,128	| IOT142 |	Mostly
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:34,432	| IOT142 |	Okay where are we today with
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:35,200	| IOT142 |	Like the development of this
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:40,064	| IOT142 |	Yeah we have more technological capability
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:41,088	| IOT142 |	And we have
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:41,600	| IOT142 |	Business case
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:44,672	| IOT142 |	That is there's all kinds of fantastic things we can
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:46,976	| IOT142 |	Do with textile base sensors in
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:47,744	| IOT142 |	And smart textiles
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:53,120	| IOT142 |	Or clothing but there isn't a fantastic way to make money at it yet so what you can see if you look across
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:57,728	| IOT142 |	Kickstarter or Indiegogo or go do some of the hardware accelerators
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:01,824	| IOT142 |	Different ideas on what could be done
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:03,360	| IOT142 |	With sensing in
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:04,384	| IOT142 |	Soft goods
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:06,688	| IOT142 |	But you find very little of them really making
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:07,200	| IOT142 |	Can a big impact
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:08,480	| IOT142 |	Market
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:12,064	| IOT142 |	I think some of us are probably familiar with what we've seen in
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:12,832	| IOT142 |	Sportswear
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:13,856	| IOT142 |	That is workout
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:16,416	| IOT142 |	Clothing that's really quantify your activity
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:21,280	| IOT142 |	Hope you understand how many calories you burn to help you understand is your posture correct
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:22,816	| IOT142 |	Your emotions correct
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:23,840	| IOT142 |	And give you that kind of feedback
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:30,240	| IOT142 |	What we haven't seen yet is something for the commercial Market that really solves a very big problem
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:32,032	| IOT142 |	And I think we are approaching a
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:34,848	| IOT142 |	We're going to begin to see some things happening in the medical in
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:38,944	| IOT142 |	Where you'll begin to see patients sent home with
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,480	| IOT142 |	An item
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:43,552	| IOT142 |	Smart clothing that they can wear that'll take their basic measure
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:45,856	| IOT142 |	Heart rate respiration
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:46,624	| IOT142 |	Temperature
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:48,672	| IOT142 |	The three most critical and they can take them
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:49,440	| IOT142 |	Constantly
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:51,232	| IOT142 |	So you don't even have to be involved in
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,280	| IOT142 |	Anyway and just simply send that data back
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:54,816	| IOT142 |	To your medical practice
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:58,656	| IOT142 |	Keep tabs on you in real time this also has
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:00,192	| IOT142 |	Utility for
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:01,472	| IOT142 |	Pharmaceutical trial
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:05,312	| IOT142 |	Where they often rely on people to do self-reporting
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:06,336	| IOT142 |	How they feel
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:08,896	| IOT142 |	When trying a new truck if your getting some of these basic
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:11,712	| IOT142 |	Have to rely as much on self according to
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:12,992	| IOT142 |	Beware
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:14,016	| IOT142 |	Some sort of change
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:16,320	| IOT142 |	Gym shorts
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,856	| IOT142 |	There's a lot of things we can do
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:19,136	| IOT142 |	But very few ways to make money
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:21,184	| IOT142 |	Okay
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,720	| IOT142 |	It will talk about some of the
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:24,512	| IOT142 |	Cool health and safety stuff
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:26,304	| IOT142 |	A little bit more in depth later
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:28,096	| IOT142 |	Let's dig into
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:28,608	| IOT142 |	The tech
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:32,448	| IOT142 |	So I feel like conductive Fabrics
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:35,008	| IOT142 |	Are all the rage and thinking about things like
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:38,592	| IOT142 |	Hey there Google Levi's Jacquard jacket thing
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:40,640	| IOT142 |	Honestly is a little bit disappointing
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:41,920	| IOT142 |	Partly because of the business case
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:48,064	| IOT142 |	What the heck is a little
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:48,576	| IOT142 |	Disappointing
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:50,624	| IOT142 |	What is the tech
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:51,904	| IOT142 |	Inside these things
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:53,696	| IOT142 |	What is it really in
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:56,512	| IOT142 |	Well usually involves a conductive alipay
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:59,584	| IOT142 |	Historically that's been things
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:01,888	| IOT142 |	Conductive Yarns that are either
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:02,912	| IOT142 |	Cotyledons
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:03,680	| IOT142 |	Silver ore
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:07,008	| IOT142 |	Somehow plated with conductive material
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:08,288	| IOT142 |	Can you can imagine that
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:11,104	| IOT142 |	Any sort of fabric you put three that's one of our process
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:12,128	| IOT142 |	This is not going to be
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:12,640	| IOT142 |	Extremely durable
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:19,296	| IOT142 |	They do we honor the fabric shrink as you wash them or change shape as you watch them and that's not good for these
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:19,808	| IOT142 |	In Alaska
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:21,344	| IOT142 |	Conductors
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:23,392	| IOT142 |	So that's a limiting factor right there
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:25,184	| IOT142 |	A lot of work has been done by
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:26,464	| IOT142 |	Companies like coupons
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:27,744	| IOT142 |	In creating
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:29,024	| IOT142 |	Conductive ink
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:31,584	| IOT142 |	It can be very easily silkscreen
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:32,864	| IOT142 |	Who owns Annie's
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:35,168	| IOT142 |	Textile Laura
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:35,936	| IOT142 |	Piece of class
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:37,984	| IOT142 |	And be able to wish
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:38,496	| IOT142 |	Damned
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:41,056	| IOT142 |	The flexing in the strain
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:42,592	| IOT142 |	The Distortion that goes along
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:44,128	| IOT142 |	Being embedded in
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:45,920	| IOT142 |	Flexible substrate
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:48,224	| IOT142 |	And that seems to be the next generation
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:52,832	| IOT142 |	They can be used both for data transmission they can be used for
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:53,600	| IOT142 |	Fencing
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:56,160	| IOT142 |	It can be used even to a certain extent for low-power tree
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:57,952	| IOT142 |	It's got a lot of property
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:01,280	| IOT142 |	To improve what we can do and there's a drive cost
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:01,792	| IOT142 |	Wait
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:05,888	| IOT142 |	As well okay so when I think smart Fabrics I should think things with
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:06,400	| IOT142 |	Conductive thread
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:07,680	| IOT142 |	Now what about
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:08,448	| IOT142 |	I have like
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:09,216	| IOT142 |	Smart socks
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:09,984	| IOT142 |	Github conductive
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:11,264	| IOT142 |	And then there's like a little
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:12,800	| IOT142 |	Power Radio
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:13,312	| IOT142 |	Computer pack
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:14,592	| IOT142 |	You stick on
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:16,128	| IOT142 |	Is that the goal is to have
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:22,016	| IOT142 |	This soft Fabrics that conduct electricity and then some sort of hard non washable computer pack
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:23,040	| IOT142 |	Clicks into it
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:25,088	| IOT142 |	That's certainly not the goal
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:26,624	| IOT142 |	But that is the state of the
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:27,392	| IOT142 |	Technology
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:28,416	| IOT142 |	Today the elect
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:29,184	| IOT142 |	Chronixx
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:29,952	| IOT142 |	Generally
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:31,232	| IOT142 |	They are not embedded
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:32,768	| IOT142 |	In the fabric itself
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:35,328	| IOT142 |	I think there's work being done on
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,096	| IOT142 |	Making
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:38,656	| IOT142 |	Semiconductors on kapton substrates
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:40,704	| IOT142 |	You can truly imagine
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:42,752	| IOT142 |	Flexible
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:44,288	| IOT142 |	I see that could be
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:45,056	| IOT142 |	Embedded in the Fab
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:48,384	| IOT142 |	But I think we're several years away
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:49,664	| IOT142 |	Actual production
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:52,736	| IOT142 |	Such a thing for the time being it is going to be
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:54,016	| IOT142 |	Spencer's
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:54,784	| IOT142 |	Or
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:56,064	| IOT142 |	Los conductores
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:41:00,672	| IOT142 |	Inside a text Tyler their substrate that have to make a physical connection
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:02,720	| IOT142 |	To some sort of
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:06,304	| IOT142 |	Small PCB with a microcontroller chip on it
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:07,840	| IOT142 |	That can actually process with
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:08,352	| IOT142 |	Incense
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:10,656	| IOT142 |	Okay and you said caps Trump
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:11,424	| IOT142 |	Substrate
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:12,704	| IOT142 |	I missed
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:13,728	| IOT142 |	Captain
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:20,384	| IOT142 |	Well if you've ever seen a flexible printed circuit the substrate material there is typically something called cops on
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:25,248	| IOT142 |	It's basically just a type of thin flexible plastic that offend you can scroll traces
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:28,064	| IOT142 |	Alright okay
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:29,344	| IOT142 |	So if I'm thinking about
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:30,624	| IOT142 |	Clothing
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:31,392	| IOT142 |	I feel like
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:32,672	| IOT142 |	We talked about the
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:34,208	| IOT142 |	Athletic Market we talked about
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:35,232	| IOT142 |	Health and Wellness
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:40,352	| IOT142 |	I feel like there's also opportunities in like firefighters and military operations made
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:41,888	| IOT142 |	Yes and that
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:45,728	| IOT142 |	Seems to be where the sustainable businesses are focused
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:46,496	| IOT142 |	Today
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:47,776	| IOT142 |	Show me some much smaller
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:52,128	| IOT142 |	Any more chat warehouse and safety or the end
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:54,175	| IOT142 |	Goal you can actually command a reasonable
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:55,711	| IOT142 |	Price to build a small business
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:57,247	| IOT142 |	Is a few companies
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:42:01,599	| IOT142 |	Working in this area for a long time and they deliver things to the military
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:03,647	| IOT142 |	Vertically called smarts told your sister
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:07,487	| IOT142 |	And this can be anything from a way to
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:10,303	| IOT142 |	Distribute power around a soldier's vest
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:12,095	| IOT142 |	So you can imagine.
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:13,375	| IOT142 |	Many different devices
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:15,167	| IOT142 |	Clipped or pocketed in their vest
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:17,215	| IOT142 |	You need to keep them powered or charged
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:18,751	| IOT142 |	The way of the
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:20,287	| IOT142 |	Distributing that power throughout the best
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:22,079	| IOT142 |	Or way of Distributing
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:23,615	| IOT142 |	Throughout
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:26,687	| IOT142 |	So that a remote operation unit could
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:28,479	| IOT142 |	Our particular
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:29,503	| IOT142 |	Squatter team
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:33,599	| IOT142 |	Is behaving really going to take it to heart rates and respiration in that sort of thing
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:35,391	| IOT142 |	To be able to monitor the condition
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:37,183	| IOT142 |	Each individual
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:39,743	| IOT142 |	It's also got a lot of application
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:40,511	| IOT142 |	In Aerospace
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:46,399	| IOT142 |	And there's a one of the Pioneers in this area is a Canadian company called acts of skin that's long been involved
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:47,423	| IOT142 |	In Aerospace
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:48,959	| IOT142 |	And
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:52,031	| IOT142 |	By being able to deploy sensors into
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:54,335	| IOT142 |	The suits that astronauts wear
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:56,639	| IOT142 |	That's been one of the key areas that
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:58,431	| IOT142 |	Smart Fabrics have been involved in 4 years
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:02,527	| IOT142 |	But I think the technology is progressing to a point where now it can be much less than
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:03,295	| IOT142 |	Intrusive
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:05,343	| IOT142 |	And you can probably
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:08,927	| IOT142 |	Understand what's going on with the astronauts in much greater precision
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:09,439	| IOT142 |	Any previously
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:12,255	| IOT142 |	Okay now what about taking this outside of
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:13,023	| IOT142 |	Of clothing
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:14,559	| IOT142 |	So clothing is awesome
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:15,327	| IOT142 |	I get the
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:16,351	| IOT142 |	Utility there
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:20,447	| IOT142 |	But there's also a lot of opportunity it feels like maybe embedding it in
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:23,007	| IOT142 |	Furniture or even like my sheets
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:27,615	| IOT142 |	Track my actual sleep patterns in a way that maybe is less intrusive than a Fitbit
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:28,895	| IOT142 |	What are they doing outside of
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:30,175	| IOT142 |	And smart
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:31,967	| IOT142 |	Yeah that's
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:34,015	| IOT142 |	That really interesting question
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:35,039	| IOT142 |	When you think about it is
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:37,343	| IOT142 |	It's one of the new
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:38,111	| IOT142 |	Implications
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:44,767	| IOT142 |	The consumer iot and wearables in general is that now we get to collect a lot more information about ourselves
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:48,351	| IOT142 |	The question if you're going to be sensing all this data about her
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:49,887	| IOT142 |	Cells in all these varieties
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:52,447	| IOT142 |	Products what's the best place to really deploy
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:54,751	| IOT142 |	Particular sensor for a given
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:55,519	| IOT142 |	In a use case
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:44:00,127	| IOT142 |	I do think betting is a place where we're going to see sensing appear
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:00,895	| IOT142 |	Just by default
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:04,735	| IOT142 |	And it will be sort of a common trait
EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:07,039	| IOT142 |	In mattresses or in
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:07,807	| IOT142 |	Full bed assembly
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:09,599	| IOT142 |	That they will be able to
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:10,111	| IOT142 |	To report to you
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:13,951	| IOT142 |	Your sleep activity there's a product that t e was involved with
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:15,487	| IOT142 |	That is now used
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:16,511	| IOT142 |	It's called sleep tracker
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:18,559	| IOT142 |	By Serta
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:23,167	| IOT142 |	And basically what that's doing is sensing the heart rate and respiration and lotion
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:24,703	| IOT142 |	Of anybody who's on the bed
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:25,983	| IOT142 |	I believe it
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:29,311	| IOT142 |	Spice enough that it can even identify
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:29,823	| IOT142 |	Individual
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:31,359	| IOT142 |	Based on their heart rate
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:33,151	| IOT142 |	Because we all have unique patterns in her heart
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:34,687	| IOT142 |	That
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:35,199	| IOT142 |	Sensitive
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,247	| IOT142 |	And it's totally untrue
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:38,527	| IOT142 |	You'd never know it was
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:41,087	| IOT142 |	Floyd in the bed unless you went looking for it
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:43,647	| IOT142 |	Specifically that's one place but we all
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:44,415	| IOT142 |	Sidon automobile
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:46,719	| IOT142 |	There's bin sensors in
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:48,255	| IOT142 |	Car seats for a long time
EDL	00:44:48,255	00:44:50,815	| IOT142 |	But now with the Advent of smart textiles
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:53,375	| IOT142 |	You can actually deploy soft
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:58,239	| IOT142 |	Sensors in the steering wheel and with two hands on the steering wheel you be able to measure heart
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:04,895	| IOT142 |	With sensors in the seat you'll be able to measure heart rate as well as respiration you can tell if an individual's awake
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:05,919	| IOT142 |	Upset
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:07,455	| IOT142 |	You can tell alot about
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:09,247	| IOT142 |	What's going on under those circumstances
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:12,831	| IOT142 |	Even in an industrial setting in the
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:15,135	| IOT142 |	If you even conducted Fab
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:17,695	| IOT142 |	You can do things like gate to text
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:20,255	| IOT142 |	So that you won't need to carry around.
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:21,023	| IOT142 |	Key card
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:25,119	| IOT142 |	The building will be able to identify you simply by the way you walk
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:25,887	| IOT142 |	You can also do things
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:28,191	| IOT142 |	Give people directions throughout a venue
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:29,983	| IOT142 |	Their next meeting
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:31,775	| IOT142 |	Imagine embedded LEDs
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:33,823	| IOT142 |	That recognize your dates
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:35,103	| IOT142 |	And then like the pastor
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:37,663	| IOT142 |	Wherever you need to go to your next meeting
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:38,687	| IOT142 |	You have a lot of impact
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:40,735	| IOT142 |	Weed control in large areas
EDL	00:45:42,527	00:45:45,343	| IOT142 |	Oh my gosh Nick I went from
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:46,623	| IOT142 |	Oh my God terrifying
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:48,927	| IOT142 |	That could be really helpful
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:50,207	| IOT142 |	So
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:54,303	| IOT142 |	HIIT isn't it
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:46:00,191	| IOT142 |	So let's talk about a factor let's get into the Privacy factor and
EDL	00:46:00,191	00:46:02,495	| IOT142 |	All of these sensors seem to be
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:08,895	| IOT142 |	Deploy to figuring out what's happening in a person's body or health reasons and I know that's lovely but you know
EDL	00:46:08,895	00:46:13,247	| IOT142 |	You know I don't want my bed necessarily recognizing that I'm on it with someone who isn't my partner for exam
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:15,807	| IOT142 |	Because
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:16,831	| IOT142 |	That's scary
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:22,719	| IOT142 |	So if I think about that how do we do this without dealing with like identifying people are there other useful things that could
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:26,047	| IOT142 |	Maybe it's like light sensing
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:27,071	| IOT142 |	Sensors in your car
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:28,095	| IOT142 |	Curtains
EDL	00:46:28,095	00:46:28,863	| IOT142 |	Automatically
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:29,631	| IOT142 |	Open
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:32,191	| IOT142 |	Or things that are less like
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:33,215	| IOT142 |	Scary to me person
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:35,263	| IOT142 |	There are things that can
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:36,031	| IOT142 |	Be done with
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:38,591	| IOT142 |	Fabrics themselves this is another genre
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:40,639	| IOT142 |	Smart Fabrics words not about biometrics
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:42,431	| IOT142 |	About environmental science
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:44,223	| IOT142 |	So you can imagine shirts
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:46,783	| IOT142 |	Or clothing
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:49,087	| IOT142 |	Brick that has interaction with the outdoor
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:50,879	| IOT142 |	And in big cities
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:52,671	| IOT142 |	Places that I traveled
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:54,719	| IOT142 |	Do you like Shanghai
EDL	00:46:54,719	00:46:55,743	| IOT142 |	The air quality
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:57,279	| IOT142 |	What is she wearing a jacket
EDL	00:46:57,791	00:46:58,815	| IOT142 |	Something that
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:00,607	| IOT142 |	Would have a small section of it
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:01,631	| IOT142 |	That would change color
EDL	00:47:01,631	00:47:04,959	| IOT142 |	To give you some indication of air quality and let you know when you should be
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:06,495	| IOT142 |	Concern there's things like that
EDL	00:47:06,495	00:47:08,031	| IOT142 |	It could be done there's also
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:09,311	| IOT142 |	The opportunity now we
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:12,127	| IOT142 |	Research being done universities to
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:15,455	| IOT142 |	Actually use Fabrics that can generate a little bit of a charge
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:16,991	| IOT142 |	Kinetic energy
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:18,527	| IOT142 |	I guess we move in s
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:21,087	| IOT142 |	We walk either things that don't have any applications
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:21,855	| IOT142 |	Privacy
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:23,391	| IOT142 |	But they do provide a certain utility
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:29,535	| IOT142 |	I think another interesting option is things like haptic feedback for wayfinding for example
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:35,423	| IOT142 |	I've always because I can't tell my left from my right I've always wanted to have
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:37,215	| IOT142 |	Sleeves or
EDL	00:47:37,727	00:47:38,751	| IOT142 |	Maybe in my shoulders
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:41,311	| IOT142 |	It's like hey turn left here
EDL	00:47:41,311	00:47:42,079	| IOT142 |	I seen
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:44,383	| IOT142 |	More than one startup come up with
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:45,407	| IOT142 |	Products shoes
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:51,039	| IOT142 |	That will give you a half on the left shoe or the right shoe depending on where you're supposed to turn
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:52,063	| IOT142 |	That can be used
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:56,671	| IOT142 |	People who are visually impaired
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:47:57,951	| IOT142 |	Where we're trying to go
EDL	00:47:57,951	00:48:01,535	| IOT142 |	Let's talk about business models not just business models for the
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:03,583	| IOT142 |	How many starting this but how this stuff gets done
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:10,239	| IOT142 |	I think what we'll see is that people will come up with certain technologies that will get lice
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:14,591	| IOT142 |	Intersection between technology and fashion
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:17,407	| IOT142 |	Which for me as a guy who is not fast
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:19,199	| IOT142 |	Lesbian
EDL	00:48:19,199	00:48:20,479	| IOT142 |	Fascinating Journey
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:22,015	| IOT142 |	To see that
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:24,831	| IOT142 |	Not only can this technology be useful
EDL	00:48:25,343	00:48:28,159	| IOT142 |	Can provide really valuable insight into our health
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:29,439	| IOT142 |	Adorn fireman
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:32,511	| IOT142 |	But there's an aspect of the technology that can be used
EDL	00:48:32,511	00:48:36,351	| IOT142 |	To be beautiful and I think it's in cases like
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:37,119	| IOT142 |	Is that
EDL	00:48:37,119	00:48:37,887	| IOT142 |	Where
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:39,935	| IOT142 |	The fashion industry will
EDL	00:48:39,935	00:48:43,775	| IOT142 |	And it would then become much more acceptable
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:45,055	| IOT142 |	Unless avant-garde
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:47,871	| IOT142 |	There's been some people who have experimented with
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:49,407	| IOT142 |	Kind of social
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:50,175	| IOT142 |	Smart Fabric
EDL	00:48:50,943	00:48:53,247	| IOT142 |	You can imagine going to a football game
EDL	00:48:53,247	00:48:54,527	| IOT142 |	Where are you wearing your
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:48:56,319	| IOT142 |	Favorite players Jersey
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:58,111	| IOT142 |	And it has haptics built into it
EDL	00:48:58,111	00:49:00,927	| IOT142 |	Every time your player takes a hit you feel something
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:02,975	| IOT142 |	In that part of the Jersey
EDL	00:49:02,975	00:49:06,047	| IOT142 |	Or if your team scores a goal that shirt lights up
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:07,839	| IOT142 |	You can imagine the rest of the fan
EDL	00:49:07,839	00:49:09,887	| IOT142 |	In the stadium having their shirts on ladybug
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:10,655	| IOT142 |	The same time
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:12,447	| IOT142 |	To get these kind of shared experiences
EDL	00:49:12,959	00:49:13,983	| IOT142 |	That's another issue
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:17,311	| IOT142 |	A real useful case
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:17,823	| IOT142 |	But it's
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:21,663	| IOT142 |	And I think it's that combination between
EDL	00:49:21,663	00:49:23,199	| IOT142 |	Technology and fashion
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:24,479	| IOT142 |	They can really
EDL	00:49:24,479	00:49:25,759	| IOT142 |	Help push this
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:26,527	| IOT142 |	Forwarding
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:28,319	| IOT142 |	Real viable commercial
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:28,831	| IOT142 |	Enterprises
EDL	00:49:29,343	00:49:34,207	| IOT142 |	Yes I think the fun stuff especially like the football jersey is a great example
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:35,743	| IOT142 |	Because people already spend too much money
EDL	00:49:39,071	00:49:41,119	| IOT142 |	I could totally see how something like that
EDL	00:49:42,399	00:49:44,191	| IOT142 |	So where are we with the economic
EDL	00:49:44,703	00:49:45,727	| IOT142 |	So in terms of
EDL	00:49:46,239	00:49:48,287	| IOT142 |	How much these Fabrics cost per
EDL	00:49:48,287	00:49:49,311	| IOT142 |	Are yard I don't even know
EDL	00:49:51,359	00:49:52,639	| IOT142 |	Certainly
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:54,431	| IOT142 |	In electronics in technology
EDL	00:49:54,431	00:49:55,711	| IOT142 |	We're in
EDL	00:49:55,711	00:49:57,247	| IOT142 |	Slow mix
EDL	00:49:57,247	00:49:58,015	| IOT142 |	High volume
EDL	00:49:58,527	00:49:59,551	| IOT142 |	What is produced
EDL	00:49:59,551	00:50:01,599	| IOT142 |	The same thing in extremely high volume
EDL	00:50:01,599	00:50:02,367	| IOT142 |	Lowest possible
EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:04,671	| IOT142 |	In fashion it's
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:05,183	| IOT142 |	Much different
EDL	00:50:05,695	00:50:06,719	| IOT142 |	You're providing
EDL	00:50:06,719	00:50:09,791	| IOT142 |	Clothing that changes every season and even if you have us
EDL	00:50:09,791	00:50:12,607	| IOT142 |	Successful line of clothing
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:16,447	| IOT142 |	Sizes so it's really much more of a high mix low volume
EDL	00:50:16,959	00:50:17,983	| IOT142 |	The two
EDL	00:50:17,983	00:50:19,007	| IOT142 |	Diametrically opposed
EDL	00:50:19,775	00:50:20,799	| IOT142 |	The good news is
EDL	00:50:20,799	00:50:24,383	| IOT142 |	As Mobile Electronics proliferate whether it's wearables or
EDL	00:50:24,383	00:50:24,895	| IOT142 |	Smartphone
EDL	00:50:25,663	00:50:27,199	| IOT142 |	The cost of all those Electronics
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:31,039	| IOT142 |	The incremental cost to look at a new industry like
EDL	00:50:31,039	00:50:31,807	| IOT142 |	Smart clothing
EDL	00:50:32,575	00:50:34,111	| IOT142 |	Is slowly decreasing
EDL	00:50:34,623	00:50:35,647	| IOT142 |	The challenges
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:38,719	| IOT142 |	With the integration of the sensors
EDL	00:50:38,719	00:50:39,487	| IOT142 |	And the electronic
EDL	00:50:40,255	00:50:44,095	| IOT142 |	There's a few players out there both jabil and Flextronics
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:45,119	| IOT142 |	No flex
EDL	00:50:45,631	00:50:47,167	| IOT142 |	Double stem sinking
EDL	00:50:47,167	00:50:50,751	| IOT142 |	Significant amount of effort into being able to deploy
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:52,543	| IOT142 |	Smart clothing and solve these problems
EDL	00:50:53,055	00:50:53,823	| IOT142 |	Brands
EDL	00:50:53,823	00:50:54,847	| IOT142 |	Any bothan some.
EDL	00:50:55,359	00:50:55,871	| IOT142 |	Projects
EDL	00:50:56,895	00:50:58,431	| IOT142 |	It's still very early days
EDL	00:50:58,431	00:50:59,711	| IOT142 |	You Netflix has some partner
EDL	00:51:00,223	00:51:01,247	| IOT142 |	Better traditional
EDL	00:51:01,759	00:51:02,527	| IOT142 |	Textile manufacturer
EDL	00:51:04,319	00:51:06,367	| IOT142 |	Investing in this area have we as well
EDL	00:51:06,879	00:51:08,415	| IOT142 |	But it's still very early
EDL	00:51:08,927	00:51:09,695	| IOT142 |	And without
EDL	00:51:09,695	00:51:10,719	| IOT142 |	Big money tree
EDL	00:51:10,719	00:51:11,231	| IOT142 |	Really
EDL	00:51:12,255	00:51:13,023	| IOT142 |	Focused effort
EDL	00:51:13,535	00:51:15,327	| IOT142 |	It's going to be a lot of hit and miss
EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:16,095	| IOT142 |	Projects
EDL	00:51:16,095	00:51:17,119	| IOT142 |	That's it
EDL	00:51:17,119	00:51:19,167	| IOT142 |	1 as we see continued
EDL	00:51:19,167	00:51:21,727	| IOT142 |	Investment and things like firefighter safety
EDL	00:51:21,727	00:51:26,335	| IOT142 |	Body cameras on police officers or decreasing the technology of the military and
EDL	00:51:26,335	00:51:28,895	| IOT142 |	Space exploration that investment is going to
EDL	00:51:28,895	00:51:29,919	| IOT142 |	Continue and Nick

EDL	00:51:30,943	00:51:37,087	| IOT142 |	Does technology going to continue being developed in North Carolina and NC State and Raleigh has a fantastic
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:38,623	| IOT142 |	Body-worn sensor
EDL	00:51:39,391	00:51:40,927	| IOT142 |	Particularly Amy a textile in a
EDL	00:51:41,695	00:51:43,487	| IOT142 |	Even so you're still basic
EDL	00:51:43,487	00:51:44,511	| IOT142 |	Problems
EDL	00:51:44,511	00:51:45,279	| IOT142 |	The connector
EDL	00:51:45,279	00:51:48,095	| IOT142 |	The coast between a textile and electronics
EDL	00:51:48,607	00:51:49,887	| IOT142 |	That's funny
EDL	00:51:49,887	00:51:51,935	| IOT142 |	That has yet to be solved
EDL	00:51:52,447	00:51:55,007	| IOT142 |	A TE Connectivity we've looked at that end
EDL	00:51:55,007	00:51:55,775	| IOT142 |	Simplism
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:51:59,359	| IOT142 |	It's actually a very significant challenge to go from something
EDL	00:51:59,359	00:52:01,407	| IOT142 |	Soft and pliable to something
EDL	00:52:01,407	00:52:02,175	| IOT142 |	Hard and firm
EDL	00:52:03,455	00:52:04,479	| IOT142 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:52:04,479	00:52:05,759	| IOT142 |	What other big problem
EDL	00:52:05,759	00:52:07,807	| IOT142 |	For that switches sustainability
EDL	00:52:07,807	00:52:09,087	| IOT142 |	When I think about
EDL	00:52:09,087	00:52:11,647	| IOT142 |	Smart Fabrics I get really really excited but then I'm also like
EDL	00:52:12,671	00:52:15,743	| IOT142 |	That's going to be horrified because right now you know
EDL	00:52:15,743	00:52:17,023	| IOT142 |	Clothing does get recycled
EDL	00:52:17,535	00:52:21,119	| IOT142 |	And I feel better about tossing away a cotton shirt that I might
EDL	00:52:21,119	00:52:23,167	| IOT142 |	Something that's covered in Silver Sol
EDL	00:52:23,167	00:52:27,007	| IOT142 |	How do you guys think about designing for sustainability or do people think about that at all
EDL	00:52:27,519	00:52:29,823	| IOT142 |	I think at this early stage very few people
EDL	00:52:29,823	00:52:32,383	| IOT142 |	Thinking about it they're thinking about survivable
EDL	00:52:33,407	00:52:36,479	| IOT142 |	But the sustainability is an issue because
EDL	00:52:36,479	00:52:37,247	| IOT142 |	In
EDL	00:52:37,247	00:52:38,783	| IOT142 |	Fashion industry overall
EDL	00:52:38,783	00:52:42,879	| IOT142 |	Sustainability is really an important question that a lot of companies are struggling
EDL	00:52:43,391	00:52:44,927	| IOT142 |	So I think if we do look forward
EDL	00:52:44,927	00:52:45,695	| IOT142 |	The electronics
EDL	00:52:46,207	00:52:47,487	| IOT142 |	People like cheese
EDL	00:52:47,487	00:52:51,583	| IOT142 |	Could you play into an extent the raw materials area this
EDL	00:52:51,583	00:52:53,631	| IOT142 |	We've looked at conductive inks for a long time
EDL	00:52:54,143	00:52:54,911	| IOT142 |	Finding
EDL	00:52:54,911	00:52:55,679	| IOT142 |	Formula for
EDL	00:52:55,679	00:52:58,751	| IOT142 |	Conductive ink that is biodegradable that would have a lot
EDL	00:52:58,751	00:53:00,799	| IOT142 |	As long as you can still meet the bass
EDL	00:53:00,799	00:53:02,591	| IOT142 |	Requirements of being deployed
EDL	00:53:02,591	00:53:05,663	| IOT142 |	Textile so I think there are going to be advances like that that will
EDL	00:53:05,663	00:53:07,199	| IOT142 |	Current parallel but
EDL	00:53:07,199	00:53:07,967	| IOT142 |	Very little of it
EDL	00:53:09,503	00:53:10,527	| IOT142 |	Before
EDL	00:53:10,527	00:53:11,551	| IOT142 |	We start seeing
EDL	00:53:12,063	00:53:13,087	| IOT142 |	Really good
EDL	00:53:13,087	00:53:14,879	| IOT142 |	Valuable businesses emerging in
EDL	00:53:14,879	00:53:15,647	| IOT142 |	Syria
EDL	00:53:15,647	00:53:21,791	| IOT142 |	All right but Nick Picks so much for talking to me about this as a fashion lover and a tech lover I am excited
EDL	00:53:21,791	00:53:22,303	| IOT142 |	Terrified
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:24,095	| IOT142 |	And back to excited
EDL	00:53:25,631	00:53:26,655	| IOT142 |	My pleasure state
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:27,167	| IOT142 |	Happiest people
EDL	00:53:28,447	00:53:31,775	| IOT142 |	That's it for this week thanks so much for listening
