EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:27,200	| IOT090 |	Okay that actually sounds pretty cool I know that some people have been asking me about kind of some course worked
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,480	| IOT090 |	Prepare for the iot future
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:29,504	| IOT090 |	This
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:31,296	| IOT090 |	Level education + Cisco my
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,088	| IOT090 |	For you
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:33,600	| IOT090 |	Sounds good
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:35,392	| IOT090 |	Talk about
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:43,072	| IOT090 |	Yeah I was kind of hoping Zuckerberg would have built like the actual Iron Man suit with Jarvis but no no no you just built
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:43,584	| IOT090 |	Jarvis
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:47,424	| IOT090 |	But I have to confess I've never seen Iron Man
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,728	| IOT090 |	In my brain
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:51,008	| IOT090 |	This is like his digital butlers
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:53,056	| IOT090 |	We're not friends anymore
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:59,712	| IOT090 |	Woodspring Kevin
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:01,248	| IOT090 |	Okay
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,272	| IOT090 |	Jarvis it yes
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,552	| IOT090 |	Jarvis is the
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:05,344	| IOT090 |	Artificial intelligence that
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:06,112	| IOT090 |	Tony Stark
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:06,880	| IOT090 |	Built
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:12,000	| IOT090 |	Not just for the suit but for his lab and everything else that he interacts with like
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,024	| IOT090 |	Jarvis is
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:15,840	| IOT090 |	Pervasive in everything that Tony has
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:18,656	| IOT090 |	However yet most people do equated with the Iron Man suit
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:20,704	| IOT090 |	Okay so it's like a less murderous house
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:25,824	| IOT090 |	Yes that would be well I mean it is certainly has attacking her people but they say they were
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,688	| IOT090 |	Zuckerberg built his
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,968	| IOT090 |	Jarvis /
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,504	| IOT090 |	How less murderous hell
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:35,552	| IOT090 |	And
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,320	| IOT090 |	Did it work
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:42,720	| IOT090 |	It does work if it's limited but it works and and this is what does October gets spent as he said his
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,488	| IOT090 |	Personal challenge
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:47,840	| IOT090 |	For the year 2016 it was to build a simple AI to run his home
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,632	| IOT090 |	Just like Jarvis in Iron Man
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:50,400	| IOT090 |	And
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:54,496	| IOT090 |	He only spent a hundred hours I taste pretty darn talented because
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:57,056	| IOT090 |	He actually does have a fairly
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:58,336	| IOT090 |	Complete system
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:00,384	| IOT090 |	He's got a server piece to it
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:05,248	| IOT090 |	It interfaces with various home systems such as Crestron system
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:09,856	| IOT090 |	Thermostat d'orsogna Spotify etcetera even a toaster which is kind of neat
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:13,184	| IOT090 |	He has user interfaces that he built
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:16,000	| IOT090 |	I want is a Facebook Messenger bot
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:18,815	| IOT090 |	Sorta makes sense considering he's the CEO of Facebook
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:23,167	| IOT090 |	He has an iOS voice app and he's got an Android version
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:24,447	| IOT090 |	Planned so I don't
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:28,287	| IOT090 |	Nobody's going to do with these different versions baby switches phone that's cool
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:32,895	| IOT090 |	I am outside the door camera as an interface which will talk about a few minutes how that works
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:38,015	| IOT090 |	And then he's got some a I built into it with language processing speech recognition facial recognition so
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,807	| IOT090 |	But long story
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:41,599	| IOT090 |	Short here is
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:45,695	| IOT090 |	That he's kind of replicated what you can mostly get
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,743	| IOT090 |	From an off-the-shelf systems
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:50,559	| IOT090 |	Through an echo or Google Assistant Siri
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,095	| IOT090 |	And various third-party products
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,655	| IOT090 |	But it's really interesting he
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:56,191	| IOT090 |	Tackle this as a learning project
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:05:01,311	| IOT090 |	Obviously learned a lot route up a really long post on this which I highly recommend the read
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:05,151	| IOT090 |	But also in doing this he figures AI
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:10,527	| IOT090 |	Natural language processing is a good 5-10 years out from what he really wanted to be
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:11,807	| IOT090 |	And
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:15,135	| IOT090 |	I think it's important because here somebody who's in the nuts and bolts of things
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,671	| IOT090 |	And that's
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:21,023	| IOT090 |	Kind of a different message in some people taking away from media stories and product reviews inside
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,095	| IOT090 |	Actually
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:27,167	| IOT090 |	This is this is kind of fun he talked about on a psychological level
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,215	| IOT090 |	Once you can talk to it
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,519	| IOT090 |	System so he was talking about using both text
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:32,799	| IOT090 |	Invoice
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,335	| IOT090 |	To communicate with
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:36,127	| IOT090 |	What does Jarvis and he actually
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,151	| IOT090 |	Thanks
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:42,527	| IOT090 |	Text is actually a really good user interface and he focused on that because he doesn't think that's going away anytime soon
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:43,807	| IOT090 |	But
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:46,111	| IOT090 |	He mentions that when you can speak to a system
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:48,927	| IOT090 |	You attribute a lot more emotional depth to the
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,463	| IOT090 |	Then you might otherwise
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,023	| IOT090 |	And actually
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:56,863	| IOT090 |	He says that once he built voice into Jarvis you also wanted to build more
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:57,631	| IOT090 |	Humor
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:01,727	| IOT090 |	Later on in the show my daughter actually talks about this how she what she likes about
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:04,543	| IOT090 |	The echo is that has metaphor
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,055	| IOT090 |	Personality
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:08,383	| IOT090 |	I would actually agree to
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:11,711	| IOT090 |	After using various a smart assistant systems
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:18,111	| IOT090 |	I mean when I talk to my echo and she does only for me I almost always say thank you after work knowing full well
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:21,183	| IOT090 |	Knowing full well she doesn't care not listening whatever
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,231	| IOT090 |	She's not really there
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:26,815	| IOT090 |	But yes there is definitely a more of an emotional
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,839	| IOT090 |	Connection
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:28,607	| IOT090 |	2
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,143	| IOT090 |	The interface adapter
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:34,239	| IOT090 |	Guess which is why you should always treat your children to be polite to
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:42,943	| IOT090 |	Yeah but I also thought was really cool about this is he talks about the role of
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,967	| IOT090 |	Image record
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:45,247	| IOT090 |	Technician in computer vision
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,527	| IOT090 |	In his system
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:47,807	| IOT090 |	And I stink
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:51,135	| IOT090 |	You know we do have things we can talk to him
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:53,439	| IOT090 |	Stuff happens what we don't have
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:53,951	| IOT090 |	Yet
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:57,791	| IOT090 |	Is really high quality computer vision that can tie into
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:01,119	| IOT090 |	Like the people who live in our house so I seen it
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:02,655	| IOT090 |	But in this case
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:03,935	| IOT090 |	He built
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:07,007	| IOT090 |	With the camera out his door he he tied that like
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:07,775	| IOT090 |	The computer
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:11,359	| IOT090 |	Recognizes the person and then the person is also on his calendar
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,383	| IOT090 |	To unlock the door for the
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,919	| IOT090 |	That was a tough use case
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:20,319	| IOT090 |	Yeah and that's that's not something that you can buy off the shelf these days that I that I know of
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:22,367	| IOT090 |	Instead it's all
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:26,207	| IOT090 |	There's somebody at the door let me show you who it is and then you as a individual have to
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,511	| IOT090 |	Unlock the door say
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:32,095	| IOT090 |	Echo please unlock the door etcetera so he's taking it a step further there
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,887	| IOT090 |	I'd like to see more of that
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:38,495	| IOT090 |	Couldn't sleep because again that brings we start telling systems together I took before
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:41,055	| IOT090 |	That's when you truly bring the smarts into the Smart Hub
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:43,615	| IOT090 |	So I could see something like the August
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,383	| IOT090 |	Door lock
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:44,895	| IOT090 |	Could do that
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:47,455	| IOT090 |	You don't recognize your face when the doorbell
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:50,271	| IOT090 |	And then unlocks the door ahead of time
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,295	| IOT090 |	For you based on that
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:55,135	| IOT090 |	But I think that's actually something even if the Technologies there
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:57,439	| IOT090 |	I don't know if the average consumer is
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:01,279	| IOT090 |	And there's also the issue of things like
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,607	| IOT090 |	Can you forge Forge way through for just popping up
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,911	| IOT090 |	Words but some of these
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:09,215	| IOT090 |	Smooth your face yet
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,031	| IOT090 |	True and and granted if
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,591	| IOT090 |	Like if somebody was
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:19,455	| IOT090 |	I don't know it's a bad person took me to my front door and I didn't want not want them in my house
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:23,295	| IOT090 |	But they use my face to get in at that point you don't because the computer still comes on
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:27,903	| IOT090 |	That's obviously not good it's a extreme case
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:29,951	| IOT090 |	Restaurant
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,999	| IOT090 |	I don't have to sexual though
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,303	| IOT090 |	Cookies from a sari
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,583	| IOT090 |	So maybe don't want to
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:42,239	| IOT090 |	I just think we need the intelligence to make it work
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,263	| IOT090 |	The way you want it to work
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,055	| IOT090 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:45,823	| IOT090 |	Is that only one
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,335	| IOT090 |	Talk about
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,663	| IOT090 |	Yeah now let me recap the Iron Man
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,711	| IOT090 |	Movies free no no
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:53,759	| IOT090 |	I'll watch them eventually
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,039	| IOT090 |	All right
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:58,879	| IOT090 |	Also so we're talking about spoofing things
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,647	| IOT090 |	Hand
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,415	| IOT090 |	Security again
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:04,767	| IOT090 |	News of the World of routers there is a new
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:05,279	| IOT090 |	Attack
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,839	| IOT090 |	Vulnerable home
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,351	| IOT090 |	Working routers
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:09,887	| IOT090 |	And this one
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,447	| IOT090 |	It changes your DNS settings
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:14,239	| IOT090 |	And redirect your traffic
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:16,799	| IOT090 |	Too fragile it domains that can
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,079	| IOT090 |	Further cause harm to your
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:23,967	| IOT090 |	Yeah and secure networks as well there's all kinds of funny business going out oven
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:26,015	| IOT090 |	Once you lose control of your router that's
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:29,599	| IOT090 |	It's like losing the key to your front door to go back to the last story in
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,647	| IOT090 |	You let people in that point to do whatever
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,951	| IOT090 |	And this is called so
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,999	| IOT090 |	This place called DNS changer
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,071	| IOT090 |	So
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:43,167	| IOT090 |	Looks to see what your IP address is and if it's interested in having a
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:45,983	| IOT090 |	Get your IP address it's like I'm taking over
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,519	| IOT090 |	What can alter your firmware
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,823	| IOT090 |	Yes I did instead was just bad all around
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,383	| IOT090 |	How can you
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:52,895	| IOT090 |	Stop
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:58,015	| IOT090 |	That's a good question don't buy one of the router Center
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:00,575	| IOT090 |	I'm not sure I just
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:03,391	| IOT090 |	It's proofpoint that sounded a reported this issue
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:07,743	| IOT090 |	And that they say it's impossible to list all of the vulnerable routers but
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:12,863	| IOT090 |	They did mention three in particular for what it's worth the D-Link dsl-2750b are
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:19,263	| IOT090 |	Netgear wndr3400 V3 and related models and the Netgear r6200
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:20,031	| IOT090 |	Hundred
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,823	| IOT090 |	Doesn't mention
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:23,103	| IOT090 |	6200
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:24,895	| IOT090 |	Previous
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:29,759	| IOT090 |	If there was another Netgear vulnerability disclosed I think that was one of the Molnar
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,271	| IOT090 |	Routers
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:37,439	| IOT090 |	So is it right this makes me wonder at you know like I have an onhub and I
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:40,255	| IOT090 |	Last week makes me wonder if
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:44,607	| IOT090 |	It's at least on the surface I think it's good to have a router that has
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:48,959	| IOT090 |	Auto firmware updates coming from the cloud like Google will automatically push updates
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,775	| IOT090 |	If they're monitoring for these kinds of things that are just mean Google I mean
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:53,567	| IOT090 |	Does other companies do this as well but
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:56,383	| IOT090 |	Air monitoring for these things maybe that is a good
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,407	| IOT090 |	Way to
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,431	| IOT090 |	Quickly address them
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,735	| IOT090 |	That's true of all of your router suddenly start
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:03,039	| IOT090 |	Like if a whole swath
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,831	| IOT090 |	Have your gear as a router
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:08,159	| IOT090 |	Suddenly connect to a different place
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:13,023	| IOT090 |	In that place has the same place like to grab it smaller
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:16,863	| IOT090 |	That's actually something that any connected
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,911	| IOT090 |	Company so any iot
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,959	| IOT090 |	I think that's actually a
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:22,495	| IOT090 |	Big security thing that you should be
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:25,311	| IOT090 |	If you don't have an ionic or some sort of
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:29,151	| IOT090 |	Heuristics like a statistics sampling on your devices to
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,967	| IOT090 |	Notify you when these things happen
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,735	| IOT090 |	That's probably a prop
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:38,367	| IOT090 |	And most people would not have something that that would notify them so you know maybe again the cloud-based
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,391	| IOT090 |	Monitors
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:42,207	| IOT090 |	On routers may be helpful I know obviously that the onhub
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,999	| IOT090 |	Mywifi Google Wifi do this
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,023	| IOT090 |	Euro is
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:45,791	| IOT090 |	Connected
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:46,303	| IOT090 |	Right
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:50,911	| IOT090 |	I'm trying to think if Luma and some of the other newer type
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:54,495	| IOT090 |	Mesh networking ones are cuz a lot of mass for your
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:57,055	| IOT090 |	Email address and I keep track of things
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,591	| IOT090 |	Some people don't want to do that but
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,127	| IOT090 |	There may be a benefit to doing this
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,663	| IOT090 |	I know that we're all okay
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,711	| IOT090 |	What are pros and cons to this
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:07,551	| IOT090 |	Being able to keep an eye on your stuff
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,831	| IOT090 |	And where it goes
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:11,135	| IOT090 |	Is probably a really important
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,159	| IOT090 |	Element of security
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:14,719	| IOT090 |	Right
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,487	| IOT090 |	I would agree
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:18,815	| IOT090 |	I am not that I condone people wear support
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,863	| IOT090 |	The idea of using your
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:22,911	| IOT090 |	Modem from an ISP or as a router
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:25,215	| IOT090 |	But then again there
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:25,983	| IOT090 |	Well
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:28,031	| IOT090 |	Equipped to Monitor and handle things to
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:30,335	| IOT090 |	Okay
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,103	| IOT090 |	Let's see
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,919	| IOT090 |	We've also got
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:37,247	| IOT090 |	Yeah we had GPS
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:39,295	| IOT090 |	Serve in the military here in the US and
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,319	| IOT090 |	I'm just going to become a
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:42,623	| IOT090 |	Location standard beehive glonass
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,903	| IOT090 |	For ages as well
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:46,463	| IOT090 |	Now there's a new GPS
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,231	| IOT090 |	Galileo
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:50,559	| IOT090 |	And this is Europe's GPS system that's
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:53,631	| IOT090 |	Been in the works for a long time but they now have finally
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:59,263	| IOT090 |	Enough satellites in orbit 18 right now with 30 projected by 2020
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:04,639	| IOT090 |	And Galileo what is it bring the table is different location
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:08,735	| IOT090 |	This would you location to within a meter for everybody and if you pay
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,271	| IOT090 |	At a premium
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:14,111	| IOT090 |	You can have the location down to a few centimeters and I was thinking who you know
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:17,439	| IOT090 |	4 cars the difference between a centimeter and a meter is
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:20,767	| IOT090 |	Pretty drastic and pretty useful socar smart cities
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:25,631	| IOT090 |	Obviously not useful and phones and actually will be available in phones that meet
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:30,495	| IOT090 |	Galileo's approval and turns out that a bunch that are already on the market
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:35,871	| IOT090 |	Bunch of chips the Snapdragon 650 617 625 and 820
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:38,175	| IOT090 |	Actually 10 use
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:39,199	| IOT090 |	Galileo's
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,735	| IOT090 |	Location services
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:43,807	| IOT090 |	It's just I thought it was interesting cuz I haven't seen a lot of change
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:44,575	| IOT090 |	GPS
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,855	| IOT090 |	In the past 10-15 years
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,231	| IOT090 |	Yay
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:53,023	| IOT090 |	Let's see what else
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,047	| IOT090 |	Do we have we have
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:57,887	| IOT090 |	We have this $200 Smartwatch for $199 smart
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,655	| IOT090 |	Watch
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:04,287	| IOT090 |	I kind of miss the sun Kickstarter nothing I follow a lot of Kickstarter projects but it's actually out of Kickstarter available
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:06,847	| IOT090 |	Directions to company for $199
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,639	| IOT090 |	It's called the ticwatch 2
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:09,919	| IOT090 |	And
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:12,991	| IOT090 |	Normally when I see a hundred $99 Smartwatch in like
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,783	| IOT090 |	How much can it really do in
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:20,415	| IOT090 |	But this is surprisingly getting good reviews it's built on Android 5.1
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:27,327	| IOT090 |	Not Android Wear which is kind of interesting it's not the standard Smart Watch flavor of Android and Scott
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:30,655	| IOT090 |	Nice skin on it of Android and
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:35,007	| IOT090 |	It does the basic subunits it's great for health tracking exercise
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:38,591	| IOT090 |	Smartwatch notifications obviously the time you can change the
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:41,663	| IOT090 |	The watch face can be customized and
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:43,967	| IOT090 |	What's an Android and iOS so
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:47,807	| IOT090 |	Kind of surprised about the positive reviews I thought I mentioned it since so many
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:51,135	| IOT090 |	Apple watch iPad 599 from Apple watch for 199
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:53,183	| IOT090 |	Maybe I'll get on the App Store
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:55,999	| IOT090 |	Could use on Apple watch but Franklin not use a nap so
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:58,047	| IOT090 |	You just want the basics might be worth looking at
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:00,863	| IOT090 |	Also say
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:01,375	| IOT090 |	Seen it
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:08,031	| IOT090 |	What do we call seeing at it's a tech publication and they have great smart home coverage I love rye crisps
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,055	| IOT090 |	Light bulb reviews
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,871	| IOT090 |	So very thorough
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,431	| IOT090 |	They are launching a
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:20,831	| IOT090 |	Matrix
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,367	| IOT090 |	Are you on if this then that or you
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,647	| IOT090 |	You working from home kit
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:26,207	| IOT090 |	Devices that work with them
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:30,559	| IOT090 |	So this thing for consumers who are like
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,863	| IOT090 |	It'll probably like hills have
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,631	| IOT090 |	My job which is
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,911	| IOT090 |	Does usually cause cancer
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,727	| IOT090 |	Will it work with MyQ
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:39,007	| IOT090 |	Should I buy the Hue or
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:42,847	| IOT090 |	Peter that the wink system and I'll be like oh here will tell
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:46,687	| IOT090 |	It's interesting cuz we've had pointed out a
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:49,247	| IOT090 |	An online site that says what works with what
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:50,527	| IOT090 |	I figured with an actual name of it is
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:56,671	| IOT090 |	And it's been a great resource for me but I don't think he gets a lot of attention from a lot of things going to be easy to find where is
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,207	| IOT090 |	This sounds very similar
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:03,071	| IOT090 |	But would be much more accessible to more people I think it's pretty wise I've seen that to put this together
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:04,863	| IOT090 |	Smart Home Depot
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,423	| IOT090 |	That's the one
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:10,495	| IOT090 |	It's so easy to remember
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:13,055	| IOT090 |	I just ask Jarvis.
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,615	| IOT090 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:17,663	| IOT090 |	No
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:18,431	| IOT090 |	To you
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,967	| IOT090 |	Which is we thought it
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,247	| IOT090 |	You guys made Jessica
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:25,087	| IOT090 |	That's fine replaces idea
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:29,439	| IOT090 |	I thought I'd share some of the things
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:32,255	| IOT090 |	We've done it we've connected in our house
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,279	| IOT090 |	Houses
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:37,119	| IOT090 |	To help you guys like think about
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,887	| IOT090 |	Some of this stuff
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,423	| IOT090 |	Because honestly some of the stuff
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:42,239	| IOT090 |	All use cases are pretty highly individual
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:44,543	| IOT090 |	And it can be kind of
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,847	| IOT090 |	Overwhelming to be like wow I can
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,383	| IOT090 |	Turn my lights off for my phone
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,919	| IOT090 |	That's not exciting
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:53,503	| IOT090 |	If you can turn your lights on voice command then it is
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:56,063	| IOT090 |	We decided
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:59,135	| IOT090 |	Talk about some of our iot use cases over time
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:00,927	| IOT090 |	What we've done with stuff that we
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:06,303	| IOT090 |	I'm going to tell you about
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,839	| IOT090 |	Tracking my daughter
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,119	| IOT090 |	Bathtub
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,399	| IOT090 |	Time
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,447	| IOT090 |	And rather whether or not she was flashing
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:12,959	| IOT090 |	Too much in the bath
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:14,239	| IOT090 |	Back when she
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:17,311	| IOT090 |	So this is no longer
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:17,823	| IOT090 |	In my house
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:21,151	| IOT090 |	What I had I had a SmartThings system
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:24,223	| IOT090 |	And I took a SmartThings water sensor and I put it next to her
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:24,735	| IOT090 |	Bathtub
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:28,319	| IOT090 |	I could either have it notify me
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:30,623	| IOT090 |	Or I could have it turn my light on or off
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,415	| IOT090 |	To let me know if
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,439	| IOT090 |	The water sensor
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,463	| IOT090 |	Was what
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:37,279	| IOT090 |	And this isn't me leaving
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:39,071	| IOT090 |	1 year old
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,119	| IOT090 |	6 year old in the bath while I'm here
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,655	| IOT090 |	Just down the hall
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:43,935	| IOT090 |	And
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:46,239	| IOT090 |	Little kids that get excited they splash
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,543	| IOT090 |	A little splashings okay a lot of splashing
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,359	| IOT090 |	Hey
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,223	| IOT090 |	Nice
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:18:00,319	| IOT090 |	I'm going to cheat a little bit and recycle one of my older ideas just because
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,087	| IOT090 |	It is
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:03,903	| IOT090 |	Giving me so much peace of mind and I think it's useful
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:07,487	| IOT090 |	What we think about scheduling things in a smart home
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,791	| IOT090 |	We tend to
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,863	| IOT090 |	Think of the basic senior like turn the lights on at sundown
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:15,167	| IOT090 |	Continuing the various rooms and turn them off
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:17,471	| IOT090 |	You know when the Sun rises and so on and so forth
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:22,847	| IOT090 |	Deborah time-based but sometimes you want some my schedule and you don't know the time and I know that sounds weird
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:26,943	| IOT090 |	But I know a few shows ago I mentioned that my son who works
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,967	| IOT090 |	Really odd shifts
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:32,575	| IOT090 |	At the convenience store to work cycle come in at midnight or 2 in the morning for tomorrow I never know
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:35,903	| IOT090 |	He was leaving the stupid front door open all the time
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:38,207	| IOT090 |	And so I would never know when that was going to happen
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:41,279	| IOT090 |	So what I did wasn't like there's gotta be a way to do this
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:44,863	| IOT090 |	Anyway to have the door locked behind him regardless of the time
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,143	| IOT090 |	So
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:48,703	| IOT090 |	I actually did setup using my wink
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:52,031	| IOT090 |	App on my wink Hub and the Z-Wave lock set
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:52,799	| IOT090 |	On the front door
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,335	| IOT090 |	Saying you know what
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:57,407	| IOT090 |	If it anytime doesn't matter when
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:59,455	| IOT090 |	The front door's unlocked for more than 5 minutes
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,479	| IOT090 |	Just lock it
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:04,575	| IOT090 |	And since then I've never had more than 5 minutes with
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,343	| IOT090 |	The house
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,111	| IOT090 |	Unsecured
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:08,671	| IOT090 |	It's just something I thought of
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:09,439	| IOT090 |	Until I
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:11,487	| IOT090 |	Ashley Rendon the situation so
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,791	| IOT090 |	When you're thinking about scheduling things
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:17,375	| IOT090 |	Think of things that may not be around a certain time.
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:21,471	| IOT090 |	I like it I still like can't offer you guys the right way to
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:26,335	| IOT090 |	Tell your house go to sleep without telling it to go to sleep or telling the echo to make it go to sleep
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:27,871	| IOT090 |	I worked on that
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:35,551	| IOT090 |	If it was a way like three of this than that to use your if your mother in your sleep with a device if it's easier
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,831	| IOT090 |	Resting heart rate go below a certain
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:37,855	| IOT090 |	Mount
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,647	| IOT090 |	You could assume you're sleeping and then
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:41,183	| IOT090 |	Shut everything down
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:41,951	| IOT090 |	Mechanical
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,255	| IOT090 |	I did use
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:44,767	| IOT090 |	Jaw bone
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,863	| IOT090 |	When I tried to
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,143	| IOT090 |	Connect my Jawbone
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:54,239	| IOT090 |	How is my jaw bone is connected to my nest
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:20:00,895	| IOT090 |	That caused some drama so that was a member that I remember that guy I think in Syria could be done
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:05,759	| IOT090 |	Here's why
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,271	| IOT090 |	Because I don't
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:10,111	| IOT090 |	Because even though my heart rate is
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:12,415	| IOT090 |	You know my husband might be up
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,695	| IOT090 |	And he gets real cranky
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:17,535	| IOT090 |	When you know he's downstairs reading a book and all the lights go out
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:21,375	| IOT090 |	Yeah I can say that and then you won't be sleeping cuz he'll be yelling
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,399	| IOT090 |	Exactly
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:25,215	| IOT090 |	Here's a fun in
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:25,983	| IOT090 |	Somewhat
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:26,495	| IOT090 |	Silly
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:31,615	| IOT090 |	Okay this one's actually also the door locking Arena but
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:33,407	| IOT090 |	Evidently practice
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:36,735	| IOT090 |	So what I did was I actually
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,039	| IOT090 |	Gave my husband
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:40,575	| IOT090 |	This is a game using SmartThings
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:42,623	| IOT090 |	Say I chose mostly SmartThings stuff to do
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,207	| IOT090 |	I figured that would give
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:46,719	| IOT090 |	You guys some
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,559	| IOT090 |	When my husband
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:52,095	| IOT090 |	Was coming home from work
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:54,655	| IOT090 |	I gave him a SmartThings presence
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:59,775	| IOT090 |	And then when his car got into range and we left in his car cuz he didn't want the
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:03,615	| IOT090 |	It actually unlock the garage door
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,663	| IOT090 |	So
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:08,991	| IOT090 |	I got these Z-Wave locks on my garage door so basically
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:10,015	| IOT090 |	Husband pulls up
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:16,416	| IOT090 |	He automatically opens the garage door with his car and then the garage door like the door
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,720	| IOT090 |	The car in the garage that automatically
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,744	| IOT090 |	Fox
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:22,304	| IOT090 |	It was it was super nice and then
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,584	| IOT090 |	I also have
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:24,864	| IOT090 |	This is through the
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:28,192	| IOT090 |	If the garage door goes up
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:28,960	| IOT090 |	After
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:29,728	| IOT090 |	Darkbasic
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,008	| IOT090 |	The porch lights
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:35,360	| IOT090 |	If you drove
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:37,920	| IOT090 |	Which
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,576	| IOT090 |	Good morning at these things to work together intelligently the better iPhone
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:49,440	| IOT090 |	I have another one and it's actually perfect for this time of year because I used it
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,976	| IOT090 |	5 years ago
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:52,256	| IOT090 |	I like to still use it
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:54,304	| IOT090 |	We had
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,584	| IOT090 |	A problem with her
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,864	| IOT090 |	Christmas tree 5 years ago
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:22:00,960	| IOT090 |	And if anybody has pets in the house they might have run into this
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:02,240	| IOT090 |	Situation where
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,008	| IOT090 |	Press
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:04,032	| IOT090 |	Whatever
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,824	| IOT090 |	Pets was urinating on the tree
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:09,920	| IOT090 |	Edit freak me out and I want to know which one it was and all that so
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,200	| IOT090 |	No no you buy
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:15,552	| IOT090 |	Cameras for security reasons are to monitor things outside the house and so on and so forth
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:19,136	| IOT090 |	But there's sometimes a good reason to pull one of those from its
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:20,928	| IOT090 |	No no place
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:22,208	| IOT090 |	Put it in a place like this I put it
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,744	| IOT090 |	Right next to my tree
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:27,584	| IOT090 |	And had a record and it would notify me when there was activity
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:32,960	| IOT090 |	I should turn it on before bed and then woke up in the morning and turned it off so I can get notified all day as people walk around
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:37,312	| IOT090 |	And protect the cats privacy I told him in advance I was going to watch them
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,848	| IOT090 |	Tell nobody nobody
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:41,920	| IOT090 |	Yep they and nobody disputes anything or have any
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:43,712	| IOT090 |	Problems least nominally heard
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:45,760	| IOT090 |	Aside from the fact that I found out which
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:48,320	| IOT090 |	Cat in my case was the culprit
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:51,136	| IOT090 |	It actually generated a hysterical
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:51,648	| IOT090 |	Dirty
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:55,744	| IOT090 |	Fast video like a diaper video of the entire night
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:23:01,120	| IOT090 |	And I see my cats are running around and staring the tree and hitting each other and all that so that was worth it right there
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:01,888	| IOT090 |	Dfir
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:05,472	| IOT090 |	Video I think I shared it on Facebook five years back and still out there so
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:08,288	| IOT090 |	But it can be handed it to pull those security cameras in
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:11,872	| IOT090 |	Monitor for something inside the house when you really need to know what's going on I think
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,408	| IOT090 |	Yes
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,688	| IOT090 |	And I actually use mine
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:16,736	| IOT090 |	I use my security camera
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:18,272	| IOT090 |	Facing towards my backyard
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,320	| IOT090 |	And I have a
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,368	| IOT090 |	Motion sensor
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:24,928	| IOT090 |	You can use a motion sensor vibration sensor
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:25,440	| IOT090 |	Or
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:30,304	| IOT090 |	Bye-bye dog door so whenever my dog would leave
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,072	| IOT090 |	If it would start
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,096	| IOT090 |	Recording what was happening
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,376	| IOT090 |	Backyard
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:35,424	| IOT090 |	My dog has a dog door
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:37,984	| IOT090 |	Recording starts and I did that because my dog is an escape
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,008	| IOT090 |	Artist
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:41,568	| IOT090 |	I always have to be aware that she might get out and
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,336	| IOT090 |	If she does get out
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,896	| IOT090 |	I can either get a notification or
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:47,712	| IOT090 |	I can see how she's getting out so I can Shore up that section of it
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,480	| IOT090 |	Pets
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:49,248	| IOT090 |	Make sense
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:51,296	| IOT090 |	You can also do this with children
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:52,064	| IOT090 |	If there
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:52,576	| IOT090 |	Doing something
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:03,840	| IOT090 |	An open close sensor plus a notification is a great way
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:04,864	| IOT090 |	2
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:05,632	| IOT090 |	Maybe.
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:10,496	| IOT090 |	Lock certain areas you don't want your kids to be but maybe you want to track who's
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:12,032	| IOT090 |	Who's doing what are. Who
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,592	| IOT090 |	When Something's Happened
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:16,640	| IOT090 |	Thanks so like we had one in our liquor cabin
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,920	| IOT090 |	Then every time
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,480	| IOT090 |	Yep
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:22,784	| IOT090 |	Diving
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:26,880	| IOT090 |	No it didn't make sense though
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:30,464	| IOT090 |	Okay then that's a perfect use of an open close sensor that
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:35,072	| IOT090 |	People may not think of this thing open close all I wanted my door is one of my windows a security security
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:36,352	| IOT090 |	It's not just about security
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:39,936	| IOT090 |	Yes you could even guard your cookie jar Dunt Dunt
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:41,728	| IOT090 |	All right
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:44,288	| IOT090 |	So sorry
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:45,056	| IOT090 |	For you
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:46,592	| IOT090 |	This is
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:49,152	| IOT090 |	Hopefully something fun that you can do
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:52,224	| IOT090 |	And of course you can always connect your holiday lighting
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:52,992	| IOT090 |	2
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:55,808	| IOT090 |	MINI Connected plugs both indoor and out
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:25:00,672	| IOT090 |	Griffin together and suddenly you can say something like Echo turn on Christmas or
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,976	| IOT090 |	Turn on Christmas
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:04,512	| IOT090 |	And Wallah
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,536	| IOT090 |	It's like magic
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:06,816	| IOT090 |	Yep
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,120	| IOT090 |	It works really well when you're
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:09,632	| IOT090 |	You're bleary-eyed
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,424	| IOT090 |	On Christmas morning actually
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:13,472	| IOT090 |	Coming down the stairs feel like
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:16,544	| IOT090 |	Mass
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,896	| IOT090 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:21,664	| IOT090 |	I don't know
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:22,432	| IOT090 |	How to help you with that
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:29,344	| IOT090 |	That's it for this week show I hope you guys have a happy holidays if you celebrate them

EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:49,056	| IOT090 |	Stay tuned for a real-life perspective
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:51,616	| IOT090 |	Not people like Kevin and I
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,640	| IOT090 |	On what it's like to live
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:53,920	| IOT090 |	With the internet
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:54,688	| IOT090 |	All things
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:55,968	| IOT090 |	And Kevin
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:59,808	| IOT090 |	I'll see you next week sounds good happy holidays everyone
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:06,208	| IOT090 |	Hey everyone this is Stacy and we're interrupting this week podcast with a message from our sponsor sponsor
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:07,232	| IOT090 |	Is Samsung art
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:13,120	| IOT090 |	And I have a beer in the director of product marketing
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:13,888	| IOT090 |	Arctic
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,656	| IOT090 |	Cloud
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:17,728	| IOT090 |	Before we get started remind the audience once again
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:19,008	| IOT090 |	What is art
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:19,520	| IOT090 |	Cloud
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:26,176	| IOT090 |	King comforters iot technology to easily and quickly Fed rate between many-sided devices and Cloud
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,480	| IOT090 |	It's a Federation of clouds
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:32,320	| IOT090 |	It's a mechanism to facilitate open data exchange between
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:34,880	| IOT090 |	Traditionally siloed iot devices and Cloud
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:38,208	| IOT090 |	We provide companies a super-fast way
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,256	| IOT090 |	To connect many solar devices
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:42,816	| IOT090 |	And applications and deliver new service
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:45,888	| IOT090 |	All right well I just signed up for this so
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:47,168	| IOT090 |	How easy is it going to be
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:49,216	| IOT090 |	It's that easy
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:53,824	| IOT090 |	Let's take an example of a healthcare provider let's say you are
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:57,664	| IOT090 |	Hospital in Yuan to create a patient monitoring solution
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:59,456	| IOT090 |	You want to use data from
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:05,856	| IOT090 |	Personal health iot devices like a pulse oximeter blood pressure monitor maybe even a sickness tracker
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:09,952	| IOT090 |	These devices were never designed to work together so bathing a solution
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:12,000	| IOT090 |	Like this is actually pretty hard
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:14,560	| IOT090 |	However without a cloud we've made it really easy
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:20,448	| IOT090 |	We've got connectors 2/30 + popular devices diesel connectors we've tested and verified
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,984	| IOT090 |	Chase your device
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:23,520	| IOT090 |	Is within that mix
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,288	| IOT090 |	You can
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:25,824	| IOT090 |	Quickly create devices in
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:27,872	| IOT090 |	Start getting data from those devices
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:31,712	| IOT090 |	It's like we've got devices created in as little as four minutes
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:35,808	| IOT090 |	You can also connect surgical devices and we support http
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:39,136	| IOT090 |	Websockets into DD collapse you have a lot of options
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:45,024	| IOT090 |	In connecting devices and collecting data from them once you have data in artik Cloud
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:49,632	| IOT090 |	You can now start to use our powerful tools like orchestration engine
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:52,192	| IOT090 |	Where you can act on many events
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:54,496	| IOT090 |	How many devices and send many actions
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:57,568	| IOT090 |	So in the healthcare example again you could
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:28:03,968	| IOT090 |	Look at you know Wendy oximeter reading exceeds a threshold and let's a blood pressure monitor
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,736	| IOT090 |	Seesaw
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:07,552	| IOT090 |	Special Andy occupancy sensor in your home
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:10,368	| IOT090 |	Indicates that maybe you haven't gotten out of bed
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:12,416	| IOT090 |	Well that might be caused
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:16,256	| IOT090 |	To send alert to a physician and maybe also to a loved one
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:18,304	| IOT090 |	So that would be very easy for
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:20,352	| IOT090 |	It developer to do with artik cloud
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:25,216	| IOT090 |	And finally all the platform entities in Arctic Cloud expose API
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:29,824	| IOT090 |	So somebody better percent point they can start doing more with the data very quickly
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:32,128	| IOT090 |	Building a mobile app
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:37,504	| IOT090 |	All their building of visualization tool or they're feeding that data into a
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:38,016	| IOT090 |	Analytics
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:42,112	| IOT090 |	So it's very straightforward very easy for the developer to use
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:44,160	| IOT090 |	And provides a lot of value to come to
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:47,488	| IOT090 |	I can't wait to get started so where can I find out
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:49,280	| IOT090 |	You can get started
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:53,888	| IOT090 |	Today without 3-tier at arctix. Cloud that's a
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:55,680	| IOT090 |	RTI
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,704	| IOT090 |	K. Cloud
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:29:03,872	| IOT090 |	Start with a free tier you get access to all the capabilities we provide and you can start building your applications today
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:10,272	| IOT090 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the intern
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:15,648	| IOT090 |	Ran out of things podcast this is Stacey Higginbotham and as a special treat Our Guest this week is
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,208	| IOT090 |	My family
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:21,792	| IOT090 |	So I have Andrew here who is my husband
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:22,816	| IOT090 |	Say hello Andrew
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:23,584	| IOT090 |	Hello
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:25,888	| IOT090 |	And I have my daughter Anna
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:26,912	| IOT090 |	Who is 10
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:28,704	| IOT090 |	And has her own perspective
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:30,240	| IOT090 |	Say hello Anna
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,288	| IOT090 |	Hello alright
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,336	| IOT090 |	This is an exciting event
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,128	| IOT090 |	Podcast history
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:39,456	| IOT090 |	Basically what we're doing is trying to help
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:41,504	| IOT090 |	You understand how the internet of things can affect
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:42,784	| IOT090 |	Your family
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:46,368	| IOT090 |	Because they have opinions and sometimes
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:47,648	| IOT090 |	They're not opinions you want to hear
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:50,464	| IOT090 |	So let's kick it off with you
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:56,864	| IOT090 |	In the last year we've added a couple more things to our house can you tell me kind of your thoughts about this year and are smart
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:30:00,704	| IOT090 |	I think the coolest Gadget will call the gadget we
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:02,752	| IOT090 |	We tried this year was the June oven
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:04,288	| IOT090 |	It was also the most expensive
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:08,384	| IOT090 |	And I think that if we only had one oven
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:11,200	| IOT090 |	We definitely own a June oven hours are second oven
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:14,528	| IOT090 |	And I'm contemplating maybe buying it anyway
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:17,344	| IOT090 |	To add to our collection and replace our toaster oven
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,648	| IOT090 |	Wait before you go on
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:21,184	| IOT090 |	What made the June oven so can pay
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,464	| IOT090 |	To you and everybody
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:24,512	| IOT090 |	Andrew is an iot skepta
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:26,048	| IOT090 |	He is your every man
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:28,096	| IOT090 |	Who is like
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:31,424	| IOT090 |	I don't I don't want to leave my light switches on to make things work
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:35,520	| IOT090 |	What I love about the June is its practical right so
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:38,080	| IOT090 |	For those that didn't listen to your review about that Union
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,640	| IOT090 |	Basically you can put food in it
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,176	| IOT090 |	And it says
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:46,272	| IOT090 |	This is what I think the food is and if it is then it just Cooks It
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:47,040	| IOT090 |	Cooks it perfect
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,832	| IOT090 |	Quickly so for example we put
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:50,624	| IOT090 |	A 5lb chicken in there
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:51,904	| IOT090 |	And it said
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:53,440	| IOT090 |	Is this a chicken
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:55,744	| IOT090 |	Yes and then it said how would you like it cooked
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:57,536	| IOT090 |	Juicy extra juicy or well-done
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:30:59,328	| IOT090 |	And we said
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:07,264	| IOT090 |	Cooked perfectly and it said how it's done so it's kind of foolproof cooking the other time the other good use case for
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:09,824	| IOT090 |	What was we were baking cookies and we had guests over
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:11,872	| IOT090 |	And we went out onto the deck
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,664	| IOT090 |	So we weren't there
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:14,944	| IOT090 |	In the kitchen
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:16,480	| IOT090 |	But it
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:17,760	| IOT090 |	Through the iPhone
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:21,088	| IOT090 |	When the food was done and we were actually able to watch it
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:25,952	| IOT090 |	In case we were skeptical that it was going to actually tell us when it was done because there's a camera on the inside
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:28,512	| IOT090 |	So it showed exactly
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:30,560	| IOT090 |	We could actually watch the cookies
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,328	| IOT090 |	Baked
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:33,120	| IOT090 |	Which is pretty cool as well so
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:34,656	| IOT090 |	I think the hands off
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:36,192	| IOT090 |	Approach the fact that it's
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:37,728	| IOT090 |	It's kind of idiot proof
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:44,640	| IOT090 |	I think those are two things about the June I like now it does come with a $1,500 price tag which is about the cost
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:47,200	| IOT090 |	About how much I think he's were are Ovens cost
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:51,040	| IOT090 |	Abbott also plays directly into a regular outlet
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:51,808	| IOT090 |	Which
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:56,928	| IOT090 |	Or if you hadn't up and you have to add a special circuit which I think was a few hundred dollars as well
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:58,208	| IOT090 |	Okay
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:31:59,744	| IOT090 |	So outside of this
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,256	| IOT090 |	Particular device
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:03,328	| IOT090 |	What other changes have happened in our house this year
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:04,864	| IOT090 |	Oh hey
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:07,424	| IOT090 |	That was worthwhile or
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:08,192	| IOT090 |	That was not
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:09,984	| IOT090 |	I
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:15,104	| IOT090 |	Hue motion sensors and so we tried this
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:17,664	| IOT090 |	Where the stack lights this year is that when I tried to wear this year
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:20,224	| IOT090 |	It all runs together
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:22,528	| IOT090 |	The stack lights were also.
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:25,600	| IOT090 |	Malaysian sew to put this in perspective their couple
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:29,696	| IOT090 |	Rooms at our house we're having a motion sensor for the light
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:31,232	| IOT090 |	Archie
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:34,560	| IOT090 |	In one case there was when we designed our house we
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:38,912	| IOT090 |	Did not put an electrical outlet in the little toilet room in the master bath
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:40,704	| IOT090 |	So there's no way to put a nightlight there
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:43,264	| IOT090 |	And so the stack light was
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:47,104	| IOT090 |	Was a great solution there because you walked in and had a motion sensor and weak
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:50,944	| IOT090 |	We're able to set it so that overnight it would be a dim light
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:52,992	| IOT090 |	You know what maybe twenty 30%
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:56,576	| IOT090 |	So that was good solution there but you know the stock had another
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:33:02,976	| IOT090 |	Hub that we had to add to our Network in so the Hue motion sensor does the same thing for us
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:04,256	| IOT090 |	With our existing Hue hub
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:05,024	| IOT090 |	So
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:08,864	| IOT090 |	In motion sensor in that toilet room as well as now in the laundry room
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:11,680	| IOT090 |	Which was another Little Flower
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:18,080	| IOT090 |	Heavenly designer house where we put the switch in the laundry room was not a great location plus when you go into the laundry your hands
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:19,360	| IOT090 |	Anyways so
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:21,408	| IOT090 |	I think what else
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:23,456	| IOT090 |	Doorbells I know you test
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:25,760	| IOT090 |	The doorbell is this year and in my mind
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:29,344	| IOT090 |	The doorbells are the smartest security device
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:30,368	| IOT090 |	That we can add
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:32,160	| IOT090 |	To a house and so
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:36,768	| IOT090 |	Here we kind of went a little form over function I think it first would you agree
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:38,048	| IOT090 |	I would
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:38,816	| IOT090 |	And we did that because
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:39,328	| IOT090 |	As you value
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:42,912	| IOT090 |	I do got this modern house
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:44,960	| IOT090 |	With all these right angles
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:48,544	| IOT090 |	And so be August lock I think
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:50,592	| IOT090 |	Looked the best it's a square
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:52,640	| IOT090 |	And then the
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:55,456	| IOT090 |	Thank you the August 12th
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,504	| IOT090 |	But the skybell I think
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:59,808	| IOT090 |	We found work better but it's round
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:02,880	| IOT090 |	So it still looks nice but both of them I think
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:04,928	| IOT090 |	Better than the ring
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:07,488	| IOT090 |	But at the end of the day
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:08,768	| IOT090 |	Your doorbell doesn't
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,304	| IOT090 |	Connect right away work like
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:12,608	| IOT090 |	It's supposed to then what's the point
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:13,888	| IOT090 |	It seems like the August
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:17,728	| IOT090 |	Doorbell is working better now but for a long time there
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:20,544	| IOT090 |	I know someone will come to the door and I get
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:25,152	| IOT090 |	Little China my iPhone saying hey someone's at the door so I click connect
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:27,456	| IOT090 |	And by the time I connected they were gone
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:32,576	| IOT090 |	Because it would take 20 or 30 seconds that was kind of an issue but it seems like it's a lot better now
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:35,904	| IOT090 |	I should mention this guy Bill is a sponsor of the show
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:36,928	| IOT090 |	I also note that you
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:41,536	| IOT090 |	You guys and I'm also curious because I'm times I think some of our issues with our doorbell was
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:42,816	| IOT090 |	WhatsApp Wi-Fi
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:44,608	| IOT090 |	And this year we changed our WiFi network
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:45,120	| IOT090 |	So
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:48,448	| IOT090 |	Do you feel that our Wi-Fi coverage is better now that we switch to the
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:52,288	| IOT090 |	I would say did I notice better connect
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:54,336	| IOT090 |	Tivity around the house probably not
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:57,152	| IOT090 |	But maybe that just means for the most part it was was working
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:59,968	| IOT090 |	Okay you didn't not notice connected
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:05,600	| IOT090 |	Let's move to Anna because you know you're kind of is grumpy practical person of texo
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:09,184	| IOT090 |	At a you forbade me to put any connected things in your room
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:12,000	| IOT090 |	Can you talk to me about
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:13,024	| IOT090 |	Why you taking that
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:17,376	| IOT090 |	Because I feel personally
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:18,144	| IOT090 |	That
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:19,680	| IOT090 |	Things that
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:21,216	| IOT090 |	Teacher's response
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:22,496	| IOT090 |	Disability and
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,520	| IOT090 |	How
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,800	| IOT090 |	Function works
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,568	| IOT090 |	In our lives
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:28,640	| IOT090 |	And I feel like especially when you're
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:29,664	| IOT090 |	Gallagher
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:31,200	| IOT090 |	That you need to
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:34,272	| IOT090 |	Where are these responsibilities and how the world works
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:37,856	| IOT090 |	Sometimes connected devices
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,136	| IOT090 |	What do those things
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:39,648	| IOT090 |	Taurus
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:40,928	| IOT090 |	And
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:42,464	| IOT090 |	We bought learn like
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:45,024	| IOT090 |	Like habitat
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:46,304	| IOT090 |	And where we live
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:48,864	| IOT090 |	How to operate it
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:51,680	| IOT090 |	And sad will go depending on
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:56,032	| IOT090 |	A smart device or a computer
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:57,568	| IOT090 |	Or technology
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:58,848	| IOT090 |	To do it for us
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:01,152	| IOT090 |	And I just personally feel
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,432	| IOT090 |	That
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:06,016	| IOT090 |	I want to do some of these things for myself and
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:07,296	| IOT090 |	Get the feel of
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:08,576	| IOT090 |	Gellan gum
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:09,856	| IOT090 |	My way
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:17,024	| IOT090 |	That's not to say you don't use this stuff in our home so what of all the things
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:17,792	| IOT090 |	What are your favorite
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:21,120	| IOT090 |	I really like Alexa
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:23,424	| IOT090 |	Because
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:25,984	| IOT090 |	She does have apps
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:26,496	| IOT090 |	Silly
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,544	| IOT090 |	Some personality
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,056	| IOT090 |	Which
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:32,128	| IOT090 |	I really value because
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:34,688	| IOT090 |	She's just kind of Les
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:36,224	| IOT090 |	Robotic
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:37,760	| IOT090 |	And more
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:38,272	| IOT090 |	Like
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:39,808	| IOT090 |	Interactive
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:44,416	| IOT090 |	She also would you do things
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:45,696	| IOT090 |	That we already have two
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:46,464	| IOT090 |	To do if Catholic
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:47,744	| IOT090 |	You can't Milly
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:49,280	| IOT090 |	Get
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:50,816	| IOT090 |	A song to play
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:53,120	| IOT090 |	And I don't know one of your
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:54,912	| IOT090 |	I'm speakers
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:56,192	| IOT090 |	Youjizz
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:57,472	| IOT090 |	Can't do that
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:59,008	| IOT090 |	Yourself without technology
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:00,288	| IOT090 |	So
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,824	| IOT090 |	That's more or less
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:04,640	| IOT090 |	Something that she can help on
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:07,200	| IOT090 |	What about the light bulbs
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:12,320	| IOT090 |	We've got some colored light bulbs downstairs I've offered you colored light bulbs in your room but you said no.
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:15,136	| IOT090 |	But how do you feel about 10 of our lighting situation
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:18,208	| IOT090 |	That's just plain fun
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:20,000	| IOT090 |	Can I get a connected light bulb in your room or no
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:23,072	| IOT090 |	No because I feel like
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:26,144	| IOT090 |	This time it's more about my room
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:31,264	| IOT090 |	Not really like the tech in my room it's just that my rooms already
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:32,032	| IOT090 |	Really
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:33,568	| IOT090 |	Colorful Island
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:35,360	| IOT090 |	Standout ish
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:39,200	| IOT090 |	We've also played with some connected toys
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:43,040	| IOT090 |	Do you have any things that moms brought home to play with with you that you really enjoyed
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:47,136	| IOT090 |	I really enjoyed little bit
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:47,904	| IOT090 |	Because this
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:49,184	| IOT090 |	Time.
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:53,024	| IOT090 |	Was more about function and it was an activity that we could do together
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:54,816	| IOT090 |	Awesome
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:55,328	| IOT090 |	Any other toys
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:57,632	| IOT090 |	I also really like
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:37:59,168	| IOT090 |	The drop kitchen
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:00,448	| IOT090 |	Because
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:02,496	| IOT090 |	Was just
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:04,288	| IOT090 |	Me and
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:05,312	| IOT090 |	You
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:06,592	| IOT090 |	Daughter and mom
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:07,872	| IOT090 |	Playing
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:09,408	| IOT090 |	Having fun
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:09,920	| IOT090 |	We
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:11,968	| IOT090 |	We're just really
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:17,344	| IOT090 |	Just interacting we are baking together we are both doing one of our favorite hobbies
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,392	| IOT090 |	It just
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:20,416	| IOT090 |	Really
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:22,464	| IOT090 |	Instead of us interacting with the device
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:24,000	| IOT090 |	It was
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:25,536	| IOT090 |	Accenture acting with each other
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:27,072	| IOT090 |	Wow that's awesome
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:29,120	| IOT090 |	How did you feel about the cosmo
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:33,216	| IOT090 |	Also really nice because
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:35,520	| IOT090 |	You got to be the influence
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:38,080	| IOT090 |	There instead of it being your influence
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:42,688	| IOT090 |	It has a personality and you can build up on that personality
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:46,528	| IOT090 |	I find it really funny because
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,576	| IOT090 |	You can play with it and
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:50,112	| IOT090 |	You can watch
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:52,160	| IOT090 |	Emotions
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:52,928	| IOT090 |	And
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:53,952	| IOT090 |	How it reacts
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:54,976	| IOT090 |	To certain things
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:59,072	| IOT090 |	And you can teach it new items and help
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:02,912	| IOT090 |	Get in touch with both the cat world and the real world
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:04,704	| IOT090 |	Okay
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:05,728	| IOT090 |	That's awesome thanks
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:09,824	| IOT090 |	We brought into our house Google home
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:12,384	| IOT090 |	And I've noticed Anna that you have a challenge
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:13,920	| IOT090 |	Where sometimes you
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:15,712	| IOT090 |	Want to talk to the echo
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:20,832	| IOT090 |	But you're in front of the Google home and so you're like hey and it doesn't respond cuz you're not
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:22,368	| IOT090 |	Calling it by its name so
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:24,928	| IOT090 |	I was just curious is it hard to remember who you're talkin
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:31,328	| IOT090 |	Yeah more or less because the name is kind of stick with me since they're my everyday life
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:34,144	| IOT090 |	And so when another smart device
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:34,912	| IOT090 |	Tom's
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:37,728	| IOT090 |	It'll just kind of confused me and I'm like
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:39,264	| IOT090 |	Because really
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:42,592	| IOT090 |	Like Google home and Echo
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:44,896	| IOT090 |	Both serve kind of the same purpose
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:48,224	| IOT090 |	So it's based on design that yacht
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:48,992	| IOT090 |	Two different style
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:51,808	| IOT090 |	Invoice and other features
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:53,088	| IOT090 |	But it's really
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:54,368	| IOT090 |	Hard
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:58,976	| IOT090 |	Find me because I just interact with one most of the time
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:00,000	| IOT090 |	And then
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:02,560	| IOT090 |	Like a station now they're closer to me
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:05,376	| IOT090 |	It's just sometimes confuses me
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:07,168	| IOT090 |	Guys what don't you like
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:08,448	| IOT090 |	About her house
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:09,472	| IOT090 |	And all of the gadgetry
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:13,568	| IOT090 |	I personally don't really like
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:15,104	| IOT090 |	The way that
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:17,920	| IOT090 |	Everywhere in our house
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:22,016	| IOT090 |	Is kind of crowded with smart devices because
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:26,368	| IOT090 |	In general I personally just feel like
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:27,648	| IOT090 |	It's kind of
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:29,696	| IOT090 |	Helps us operate Our Lives
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:31,232	| IOT090 |	But
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:36,608	| IOT090 |	Sometimes it can get annoying and it just feels really crowded when we have like
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:38,912	| IOT090 |	Lights flashing and all these like
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:42,496	| IOT090 |	Smart devices cameras many motion sensors like
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:44,800	| IOT090 |	To Oliver House
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:47,104	| IOT090 |	I like everything's connected
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:49,664	| IOT090 |	And Technology advances on us
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:50,688	| IOT090 |	It just
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,712	| IOT090 |	Makes me feel
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:54,272	| IOT090 |	Really crowded and
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:55,552	| IOT090 |	Yeah
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:59,904	| IOT090 |	So I would say so personally I love cameras outside the house
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:05,024	| IOT090 |	For security which is why I like the doorbell's I know there was an incident around our neighborhood recently
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:07,840	| IOT090 |	Where someone came to to rob a house
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:08,864	| IOT090 |	You know having a
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:11,680	| IOT090 |	You know that doorbell that captures the image
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:12,704	| IOT090 |	And such as good
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:15,264	| IOT090 |	I don't like the idea of cameras on the inside
EDL	00:41:15,264	00:41:18,336	| IOT090 |	Just from a security standpoint of them being hacked
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:24,480	| IOT090 |	I don't like the idea of that in our personal lives inside the home being recorded you know that's face it granted
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:25,504	| IOT090 |	In your case a lot of the
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:29,344	| IOT090 |	Gadgets you get our beta at best maybe Alpha
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:30,368	| IOT090 |	So
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:31,392	| IOT090 |	Which hint
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:38,304	| IOT090 |	Running into lots of issues are the other thing is we bought this Nifty thing to make garlic
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:40,352	| IOT090 |	Tronix Shades go up and down
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:42,912	| IOT090 |	Based on time of day
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:44,704	| IOT090 |	Well it's been like
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:47,008	| IOT090 |	Year-and-a-half Fifty Shades of Grey
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:49,056	| IOT090 |	Just because it hasn't been hooked in
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:51,616	| IOT090 |	Correctly what whatever what hub
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:53,663	| IOT090 |	It will work on any hub
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:55,967	| IOT090 |	Merry Christmas to you
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:59,039	| IOT090 |	For Christmas I will connect the shades
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:41:59,807	| IOT090 |	Okay
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:02,367	| IOT090 |	Cuz I have to admit it is pretty cool that
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:03,903	| IOT090 |	You know we've got these big
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:06,719	| IOT090 |	Windows floor to ceiling Windows facing west
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:09,791	| IOT090 |	It doesn't matter much in the winter but in the summer it gets warm and so
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:14,143	| IOT090 |	However you had those set up so they went down automatically in the afternoon
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:15,679	| IOT090 |	To keep the Sun from
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:18,751	| IOT090 |	But again was pretty nice when it was actually set up
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,031	| IOT090 |	Okay
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:26,431	| IOT090 |	So anything that you guys want to see or you you feel like connectivity might be better for
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,967	| IOT090 |	Like in the coming year so
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:30,527	| IOT090 |	What isn't connected that you're like if it did this
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:34,111	| IOT090 |	There's a tough question what isn't connected in her house
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:34,623	| IOT090 |	So many
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:36,927	| IOT090 |	Yeah that's
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:38,207	| IOT090 |	Quite
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:41,023	| IOT090 |	Hard I guess
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:42,559	| IOT090 |	You could have connected garage
EDL	00:42:42,559	00:42:43,327	| IOT090 |	Store
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:44,095	| IOT090 |	We have Kinect
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:45,375	| IOT090 |	Doorbells
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:45,887	| IOT090 |	Flights
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:52,287	| IOT090 |	Well you know so I will say that from we have tried some things from an Alexa
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:54,335	| IOT090 |	TriCity usage what's the
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:43:01,759	| IOT090 |	Yeah I think it's still pretty hard to get good granular idea of how much energy or using so there's no
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:04,319	| IOT090 |	Real-time troubleshooting around it
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:07,135	| IOT090 |	That is simple to use so that might be interested
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:08,159	| IOT090 |	I think
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:10,207	| IOT090 |	That it's less
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:10,975	| IOT090 |	New
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:13,023	| IOT090 |	Items in our house and more
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:18,655	| IOT090 |	Like personality so I think that over the next few years
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:19,679	| IOT090 |	We
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:21,215	| IOT090 |	Could get some of our
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:22,239	| IOT090 |	Already connect
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:23,007	| IOT090 |	The devices
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:25,567	| IOT090 |	Give them a little more personality
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:26,591	| IOT090 |	Because
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:27,615	| IOT090 |	It's just
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:31,967	| IOT090 |	You feel kind of it sometimes feels unsettling to be talkin
EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:34,015	| IOT090 |	To robot and giving
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:36,575	| IOT090 |	Monster robot but if you
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:37,343	| IOT090 |	Kind of
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:39,135	| IOT090 |	Get to know that robot and
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:41,183	| IOT090 |	Not personality like a
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:42,719	| IOT090 |	Human butt
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:43,743	| IOT090 |	Because that would be kind of
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:45,023	| IOT090 |	Scary but
EDL	00:43:46,559	00:43:52,447	| IOT090 |	Just if it had some personality of its own to add it in a bit of flavor it would be nice
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:55,007	| IOT090 |	Guys
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:44:00,383	| IOT090 |	I hold on hold on what are you planning on connecting in our house
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:03,199	| IOT090 |	Odexed year
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:04,991	| IOT090 |	You know I really want to try out
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:08,831	| IOT090 |	Cleverpet connected dog toy I will tell you that
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:14,207	| IOT090 |	All I know is that going to walk now it's not yours I'm waiting for the Drone that does that
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:21,887	| IOT090 |	Actually later this week so it's a shame that we didn't get a chance to play with it beforehand but I am going to connect homekit in a
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:25,983	| IOT090 |	Which will see if you guys like that or not and
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:27,263	| IOT090 |	It's going to break things isn't it
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:30,335	| IOT090 |	Things are going to be broken
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:33,663	| IOT090 |	And we didn't actually talk about that so you guys are really
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:36,479	| IOT090 |	Patient because I know sometimes I come in and you're like Stacy
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:39,039	| IOT090 |	I can no longer turn off our lights with our Echo
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:41,343	| IOT090 |	That's a momentary issue
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:42,623	| IOT090 |	Just hold on there
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:47,487	| IOT090 |	Well but I forgot where the light switches now you know I haven't had to use it in gear
EDL	00:44:48,255	00:44:49,535	| IOT090 |	Light switches are big bonus
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:52,095	| IOT090 |	Contention I'd like to actually replace more of our light switches
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:54,655	| IOT090 |	With Lutron or
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:56,703	| IOT090 |	No there's some new gear
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:59,007	| IOT090 |	What the Lutron works just fine
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:04,383	| IOT090 |	I will say the other day when
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:05,407	| IOT090 |	I had to print something
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:07,711	| IOT090 |	And the printer wasn't working
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:11,807	| IOT090 |	I was just standard Wi-Fi networking stuff right then
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:18,719	| IOT090 |	Yeah I troubleshooted it for 20 minutes and I came down honey do you know why the printer isn't working or you trying out a new
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:21,279	| IOT090 |	WiFi Eero
EDL	00:45:21,279	00:45:22,559	| IOT090 |	The plume WiFi pod that I do
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:23,839	| IOT090 |	Didn't bother to connect
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:24,607	| IOT090 |	The printer to it
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:27,679	| IOT090 |	Maybe I need an iot connected testing and
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:28,191	| IOT090 |	Project
