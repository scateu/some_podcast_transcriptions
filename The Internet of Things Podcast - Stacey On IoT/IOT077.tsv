EDL	00:00:24,576	00:00:28,160	| IOT077 |	A new chip from arm we got some autonomous car laws
EDL	00:00:28,160	00:00:34,560	| IOT077 |	And a new security framework for the industrial internet-of-things plus an assortment of bits and bobs
EDL	00:00:34,560	00:00:35,072	| IOT077 |	If we get today
EDL	00:00:35,584	00:00:40,192	| IOT077 |	And this week's guest is John Troutman of canary the All In One Security System talking about
EDL	00:00:40,192	00:00:42,240	| IOT077 |	How to build services for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:00:43,008	00:00:44,288	| IOT077 |	But before we get anywhere
EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:46,080	| IOT077 |	Let's have a quick word

EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:29,344	| IOT077 |	Alright let's start this week show
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:29,856	| IOT077 |	So
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:31,136	| IOT077 |	Last week
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:31,904	| IOT077 |	We talked about the
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:32,928	| IOT077 |	Kevo Smart Lock
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:33,440	| IOT077 |	Which
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:38,048	| IOT077 |	2nd generation Kevo and I said that I was not enjoying it so much because it was
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:41,376	| IOT077 |	Is a bit iffy the touch-to-open feature didn't always work
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:46,752	| IOT077 |	You're not the only one that actually had some issues too from reviews that I read
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:48,288	| IOT077 |	True
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:52,128	| IOT077 |	But you know I'm still playing with it maybe it'll get better over time but I did
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:53,664	| IOT077 |	Actually make a mistake
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:55,712	| IOT077 |	Winnipesaukee
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:56,992	| IOT077 |	This is terrible
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:58,016	| IOT077 |	It happens it does
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,552	| IOT077 |	But we hate when it
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:01,344	| IOT077 |	Happened so let me let me correct this
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:04,672	| IOT077 |	I told you guys that the smart key rekeying feature
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:08,000	| IOT077 |	Was a new feature in the Kevo 2nd gen
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,024	| IOT077 |	But it's not
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:11,072	| IOT077 |	It's actually what they've done is maven
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:11,584	| IOT077 |	Improved it
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,376	| IOT077 |	Moore security
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,144	| IOT077 |	So
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:16,960	| IOT077 |	Do so people know in case they missed it or don't know what
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:19,776	| IOT077 |	Smart key is that's where you can actually bring your own key to the lock
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,568	| IOT077 |	And have the lock
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:23,872	| IOT077 |	Intelligently rekey itself to the key correct
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,664	| IOT077 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,688	| IOT077 |	Is it only for
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,200	| IOT077 |	I think it's only fair
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:31,296	| IOT077 |	That's a good question I know the Kwikset
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,320	| IOT077 |	Lock that I have
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:38,976	| IOT077 |	Does it so yeah I guess maybe it is that's a good question I had to get something else around here and by saying yes when I don't know
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:42,560	| IOT077 |	I haven't seen it yeah I haven't seen on other brands
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,424	| IOT077 |	But
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:50,496	| IOT077 |	Searching
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:57,152	| IOT077 |	Yeah I don't I don't recall seeing that on other another devices and
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:59,968	| IOT077 |	It was actually kind of interesting
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:02,016	| IOT077 |	New technology that's only offered in select
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,040	| IOT077 |	Kwikset keyed entry
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:05,088	| IOT077 |	There you go
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:05,856	| IOT077 |	There you go
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,928	| IOT077 |	So we got it we got it right that time
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,208	| IOT077 |	We did we got it right
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,744	| IOT077 |	And I should also say
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,024	| IOT077 |	I don't
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,816	| IOT077 |	If in the excitement over this
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:15,840	| IOT077 |	I mentioned that
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:17,376	| IOT077 |	The Kevo Kwikset
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,144	| IOT077 |	Bob's
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,680	| IOT077 |	So the little fobs you can carry
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,520	| IOT077 |	They actually just
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:24,544	| IOT077 |	Actors
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:28,896	| IOT077 |	A replacement for your phone so you might give that to your kid if they don't have a smartphone
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,176	| IOT077 |	And then they too
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:30,688	| IOT077 |	Can touch soap
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:36,576	| IOT077 |	Yeah so it's like a Bluetooth presence sensor probably
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,088	| IOT077 |	Yes
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:41,440	| IOT077 |	There's the Kevo stuff
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:45,280	| IOT077 |	The bottom line still is that this lock is
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,304	| IOT077 |	A still a bit temper
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,840	| IOT077 |	It works it's really cool
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:49,888	| IOT077 |	You Really Want Your Love
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:51,680	| IOT077 |	100%
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:54,752	| IOT077 |	Moving along
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,544	| IOT077 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,568	| IOT077 |	I don't know Kevin
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:04:00,128	| IOT077 |	Which of our things should we talk about you talk about the new autonomous car laws
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:07,552	| IOT077 |	We can do that cuz it's going to turn into something else on the chips either we're going to talk about later so the Federal
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:13,440	| IOT077 |	Government has decided before the states get all crazy with car laws for autonomous cars
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:17,280	| IOT077 |	We're going to put out a list of guidelines and
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:19,327	| IOT077 |	I don't the regulations yet
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,351	| IOT077 |	But
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,119	| IOT077 |	It's a framework
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:27,519	| IOT077 |	So framework that's what we call things and in-flight yes it's a Frameworks
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:30,591	| IOT077 |	It's just a framework
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:32,127	| IOT077 |	. so not only
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,151	| IOT077 |	Framework that is
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,479	| IOT077 |	A public framework
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:38,783	| IOT077 |	Yeah so so this is going to
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,063	| IOT077 |	Address
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:46,463	| IOT077 |	Some of the potential rules of the road for autonomous cars again before the states decide to all do different things
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:52,351	| IOT077 |	Really be crazy for car manufacturers in such as to deal with so we didn't look at it I think it's like a
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,143	| IOT077 |	300 Pages this thing is
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,215	| IOT077 |	15 rules okay
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,007	| IOT077 |	We can't call the rules
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:04:59,519	| IOT077 |	Suggestions
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:03,615	| IOT077 |	It's a 15-point safety assessment that's
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,639	| IOT077 |	That's my bad CI
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:07,199	| IOT077 |	Yeah what they're talking about
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,223	| IOT077 |	Is some of the things
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:08,991	| IOT077 |	Include
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,271	| IOT077 |	Ethics so
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,039	| IOT077 |	What
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:15,391	| IOT077 |	So having the same set of ethical decisions around a self-driving car so
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,439	| IOT077 |	Do you run over the small child
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:23,327	| IOT077 |	I'm going to suggest no and I really don't need the government to tell me that but anyway
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,095	| IOT077 |	You know you're not enough
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:30,751	| IOT077 |	And I imagine there's going to be safety standards
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,519	| IOT077 |	Like I said
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,543	| IOT077 |	Like we have ISO
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,591	| IOT077 |	We have nist standards for the
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:38,687	| IOT077 |	Elements of physical safety
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,199	| IOT077 |	Echeckup
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:44,319	| IOT077 |	Don't make sense that makes sense and also in here I see some information about
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:47,647	| IOT077 |	The manufacturers of these cars providing actual data
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,927	| IOT077 |	And I guess that's going to help
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:52,511	| IOT077 |	Home some of the potential rules of the road later on
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:58,911	| IOT077 |	I wonder how these sad that you know how the Tesla's and all these other car companies are going to feel about sharing such data because
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:03,007	| IOT077 |	I just think back to the unfortunate incidents with Tesla of of late
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:08,895	| IOT077 |	You know I'm sure they they want to do their own investigations keep all the information kind of close to the to the best
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:13,247	| IOT077 |	But I don't know they're all going to be able to do that and are they going to push back on that
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:15,039	| IOT077 |	I think it's important
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:15,551	| IOT077 |	To have
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:18,623	| IOT077 |	There may be rules about like how the data shared
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,671	| IOT077 |	Like make it doesn't become
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:21,951	| IOT077 |	Completely public
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:24,255	| IOT077 |	But it's important for every autumn
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:26,815	| IOT077 |	Reddit self driving
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,607	| IOT077 |	And it shouldn't should actually starting
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,375	| IOT077 |	2B standard
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:31,167	| IOT077 |	And in some cases it may be
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:32,703	| IOT077 |	How kind of a black box so
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:37,311	| IOT077 |	When something happens we can determine exactly what happen
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,127	| IOT077 |	Is it a software failure is it
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,663	| IOT077 |	Driver error
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:42,943	| IOT077 |	Somehow
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,759	| IOT077 |	Just like we have with planes
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,527	| IOT077 |	Just because
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:49,855	| IOT077 |	We're going to have to be able to interview these cars basic
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,391	| IOT077 |	If some
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:51,903	| IOT077 |	Nothing goes wrong
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,975	| IOT077 |	Safety purposes but also like lawsuit
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:56,511	| IOT077 |	So
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,559	| IOT077 |	Right
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,351	| IOT077 |	Thanks Obama
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,911	| IOT077 |	Temperature
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:06,239	| IOT077 |	Also on the safety front
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,519	| IOT077 |	So if your autonomous car
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,311	| IOT077 |	It's got to be super safe
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:10,079	| IOT077 |	Because there's
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,615	| IOT077 |	The risk of a huge loss of
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:18,271	| IOT077 |	What should be in that car I wanted to be there new cortex r52 design
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:20,319	| IOT077 |	That they put out this week
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,367	| IOT077 |	And this is a chip
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,415	| IOT077 |	Actually it's not a chip
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,439	| IOT077 |	Sorry
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:28,511	| IOT077 |	Arm is a company that licenses its architecture to other ship make
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:30,815	| IOT077 |	A design
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:32,863	| IOT077 |	The first licensee is St micro
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:39,263	| IOT077 |	And this is for it's for autonomous cars robotics it's for what did you say Kevin something about loss of life and limb
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:45,151	| IOT077 |	Will it it adheres to certain standards in industrial circles
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,943	| IOT077 |	Set that have to do with safety and
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:51,039	| IOT077 |	There's a whole level of criticality on potential accidents that this would
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:57,183	| IOT077 |	Theoretically avoid and yes so they categorize them by you know but just a minor injury maybe loss of it.
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:00,255	| IOT077 |	Whenever I live to massive loss of life
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:03,327	| IOT077 |	So it kind of fits with the car which a moving vehicle could
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,631	| IOT077 |	You know take out 50 people so
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:11,007	| IOT077 |	They're playing industry level standards to the Safety and Security of the cortex r52
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,823	| IOT077 |	In my Safety and Security they're talking about
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:18,943	| IOT077 |	Prevention from hackers root access to the chip itself but they're also talking about
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,247	| IOT077 |	How the chip is built
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:23,295	| IOT077 |	So it's built to be really fast
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,599	| IOT077 |	In understanding what's going on
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:28,159	| IOT077 |	To be incredibly redundant
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:34,303	| IOT077 |	So there are two processors working in parallel to do each job so if One processor overheat
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:36,351	| IOT077 |	I can lose one engine you still got one left
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,911	| IOT077 |	So these are the types of thing
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,703	| IOT077 |	Talking about this is a new design
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:43,775	| IOT077 |	And it shows how the
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:44,543	| IOT077 |	Somebody is trying to
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,311	| IOT077 |	The push into
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,103	| IOT077 |	Obviously outside of just
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:49,663	| IOT077 |	Apple phones fit into all of these
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,455	| IOT077 |	Robotics and Industrial
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,991	| IOT077 |	Kind of manufacturing jobs that are
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:56,319	| IOT077 |	Happy just Automation in general
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:09:01,183	| IOT077 |	They're showing all kinds of potential applications are saying farming Healthcare Industrial
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:03,743	| IOT077 |	Obviously Transportation building automation
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,511	| IOT077 |	Aviation
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:10,655	| IOT077 |	So they won't expand obviously beyond the handheld devices and such that they're pretty much known for right right now
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:14,495	| IOT077 |	And this is an area that's really up in the air because Nvidia has been doing
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,007	| IOT077 |	Great work
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,823	| IOT077 |	Self-driving car side
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:22,175	| IOT077 |	With the processing of like lidar and radar and all of this information
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:22,687	| IOT077 |	And
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,735	| IOT077 |	This doesn't
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:27,551	| IOT077 |	Do the cortex r52 isn't going to be
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,879	| IOT077 |	Investigating your lighter this is the stuff that's going to be
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:34,463	| IOT077 |	Running your engine and making sure that all the information
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:36,767	| IOT077 |	It's coming into it
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:37,279	| IOT077 |	Actually
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,351	| IOT077 |	Is acted upon accordingly
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:41,887	| IOT077 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:45,983	| IOT077 |	It'll be it'll be interesting cuz you're right in video
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:50,079	| IOT077 |	The last couple CES show is NVIDIA time how you think that four years ago and
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,871	| IOT077 |	Their partner speaker would be like
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:55,199	| IOT077 |	Audi and they were talking about it look at our trip runs their dashboard
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:58,271	| IOT077 |	Dismiss missing their car I wonder if Nvidia
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:00,319	| IOT077 |	Which is an RN license ewill
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:04,927	| IOT077 |	Implement the core r52 security features in some of their upcoming ship designs for the cars
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,719	| IOT077 |	Hello we shall see
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,327	| IOT077 |	Another security story for you
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:13,887	| IOT077 |	Industrial internet Consortium
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,911	| IOT077 |	Which is
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:19,519	| IOT077 |	It's just a bunch of companies I'm not even to go through all of them tons of companies EMC now Dell
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,055	| IOT077 |	All these guys doing
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,591	| IOT077 |	Industrial internet stuff
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:24,639	| IOT077 |	Have released on Monday
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:27,455	| IOT077 |	An industrial Internet Security framework
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,991	| IOT077 |	There's that word again Kevin
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,527	| IOT077 |	So this is the iic
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,575	| IOT077 |	Doing the ISS
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:35,647	| IOT077 |	Independent set of best practices to help people
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,671	| IOT077 |	Assess risk
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,439	| IOT077 |	And defend against
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:38,975	| IOT077 |	So
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,487	| IOT077 |	This is
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:40,767	| IOT077 |	The big threat
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,071	| IOT077 |	For the industrial internet-of-things
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,351	| IOT077 |	What is nobody knows how to
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:49,471	| IOT077 |	There's no standard everybody's doing different things at everyone's pointing fingers when things go wrong
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:50,751	| IOT077 |	In
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,519	| IOT077 |	It's terrible
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:55,359	| IOT077 |	This group says it wants to identify requirements to
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,127	| IOT077 |	Create stand
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,407	| IOT077 |	Syncope
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,175	| IOT077 |	Practices
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,711	| IOT077 |	It's a good idea it is
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:03,039	| IOT077 |	They haven't gotten into big specifics they're basically like
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:06,623	| IOT077 |	Hear the big things we need to focus on safety reliability
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,391	| IOT077 |	Resilience
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:08,671	| IOT077 |	Security and privacy
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:15,583	| IOT077 |	Electoral Givens obviously but I do like that they are outlining the areas that they're focusing on an accent
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:18,911	| IOT077 |	Communications monitoring and configuration
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,191	| IOT077 |	So at least
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:24,031	| IOT077 |	Because I said something physical to think about here and see where they're going with us
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:28,127	| IOT077 |	And they did something that's really smart and this is something that I
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:31,967	| IOT077 |	I think we take for granted a lot they're pointing out that everybody
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,735	| IOT077 |	In the chain
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,015	| IOT077 |	Kaiser roll
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:36,319	| IOT077 |	Also in a chip makers to
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:38,623	| IOT077 |	Systems integrators to the actual end-users
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:44,255	| IOT077 |	I think that's really important and we don't kind of harp on this enough insecurity
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:46,815	| IOT077 |	But it matters in this way
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:50,911	| IOT077 |	So it's not enough to be like oh I just bought a new secure smartphone
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:51,423	| IOT077 |	And actually
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:55,007	| IOT077 |	This is a wonderful example actually this week
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:57,055	| IOT077 |	Where someone posted on Reddit that
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:12:01,151	| IOT077 |	Their neighbor was able to unlock their front door using their
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:02,687	| IOT077 |	Siri
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:04,991	| IOT077 |	Telling Siri to unlock the front door
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:08,319	| IOT077 |	In August lock that was attached to Siri
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,111	| IOT077 |	Is part of the homekit thing
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,439	| IOT077 |	And I read this and I was like
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:14,719	| IOT077 |	Okay no
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:16,767	| IOT077 |	That is not how that could ever happen
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:18,303	| IOT077 |	What actually did happen
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:18,815	| IOT077 |	Bend is
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:21,631	| IOT077 |	When you use homekit to unlock a door
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:23,423	| IOT077 |	It makes you
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,191	| IOT077 |	Put in your path
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,983	| IOT077 |	Even if your phone's like
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:26,495	| IOT077 |	Hanging out there
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:27,775	| IOT077 |	Or the iPad
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,311	| IOT077 |	And
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:31,359	| IOT077 |	This particular user apparently didn't have a
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,639	| IOT077 |	Password on there
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:36,223	| IOT077 |	Hello major major faux pas
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:36,735	| IOT077 |	So
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:40,319	| IOT077 |	This is a wonderful example of hay user
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:43,135	| IOT077 |	You are also responsible for your own security
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:43,903	| IOT077 |	Be in the situation
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,183	| IOT077 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:45,695	| IOT077 |	And
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:51,327	| IOT077 |	I also bring this up in case anybody is running homekit and doesn't have a password on their iPad or
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,887	| IOT077 |	Because Hey look
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:57,471	| IOT077 |	I'm a little skeptical about the story itself but
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:02,079	| IOT077 |	You know I'm a maybe I can I don't have a
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,127	| IOT077 |	I'm Catholic I mean
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:07,711	| IOT077 |	The thermostat hear it which I can control my voice in a security issue there
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,503	| IOT077 |	I would love to get to really see if that
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,551	| IOT077 |	An accurate story because if it is
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:15,647	| IOT077 |	Well yes I agree with you 100% from a user standpoint
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:19,743	| IOT077 |	That iPad a homekit Hub whatever she is should have a password
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:22,559	| IOT077 |	I think there's a little bit of
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:25,375	| IOT077 |	An opportunity for improvement on Apple spark there
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:27,679	| IOT077 |	To say if you're going to
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,471	| IOT077 |	Control these things by voice
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:31,007	| IOT077 |	Require password on the device
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:32,543	| IOT077 |	That's a fair
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:37,919	| IOT077 |	Amiibo spoofing should happen I'm not I'm not blaming Apple here I'm just saying nothing area for opportunity
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:39,967	| IOT077 |	The user should absolutely have the password there
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:42,015	| IOT077 |	Yes and
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:42,783	| IOT077 |	This is why
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:45,087	| IOT077 |	Like the August integration
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:48,671	| IOT077 |	The echo the Amazon Echo doesn't actually allow you to unlock the
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:49,695	| IOT077 |	She calmly lock your door
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:50,719	| IOT077 |	Exactly
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,047	| IOT077 |	Yes so anyway
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,839	| IOT077 |	Safety Frameworks
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:58,143	| IOT077 |	Tell me about recognizing the entire chain of value
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,447	| IOT077 |	One more security type thing
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,983	| IOT077 |	I was at fig monk last week
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:03,519	| IOT077 |	London witch
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:05,823	| IOT077 |	Amy's really super hot
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:08,127	| IOT077 |	My God it was like almost 90° there
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,407	| IOT077 |	And there's no air conditioning Inlet
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:14,015	| IOT077 |	There was three presentations about the Smart Home
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,807	| IOT077 |	Antenna consumer iot that
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:16,831	| IOT077 |	Really bums me out
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:19,903	| IOT077 |	Basically there is a lovely fellow
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,183	| IOT077 |	Whose house
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,975	| IOT077 |	Sounds like my house basically
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:25,023	| IOT077 |	Play he's implemented all of these things
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,047	| IOT077 |	And
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:27,839	| IOT077 |	He was miserable
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:33,215	| IOT077 |	On the smart home because it's it's
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:34,239	| IOT077 |	Which is
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:40,639	| IOT077 |	But he also pointed out that most IP security cameras can be
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:42,943	| IOT077 |	Gordon Court hacked by just sticking a
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:46,271	| IOT077 |	Paperclip in them to reset them which I haven't thought about
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:46,783	| IOT077 |	But
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:54,975	| IOT077 |	No I mean that that okay so that resets it and then I guess you could set up yourself as a user and didn't gainax
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:55,743	| IOT077 |	Access to it
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:15:00,351	| IOT077 |	And probably the individual owns the camera wouldn't really know other than the fact that they can no longer see their camera
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:01,887	| IOT077 |	Right so if you
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:02,911	| IOT077 |	You came in and ride
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:06,751	| IOT077 |	They did not in every case so especially cameras that set up their own wife
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:08,287	| IOT077 |	Wifi hotspot so if you brought your own way
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:08,799	| IOT077 |	MiFi hotspot
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,079	| IOT077 |	Eventually
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,383	| IOT077 |	Wifi hotspot
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,711	| IOT077 |	This isn't something I've
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:18,271	| IOT077 |	But even just hit a reset just
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:18,783	| IOT077 |	Turns off at
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,063	| IOT077 |	It reset
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,855	| IOT077 |	So right
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:22,879	| IOT077 |	You're no longer
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,671	| IOT077 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:26,463	| IOT077 |	So I thought about that
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:30,559	| IOT077 |	All right I'm going to have to Outlaw the paperclip
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,095	| IOT077 |	Dang it
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:36,703	| IOT077 |	It's so useful for resetting
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,775	| IOT077 |	So there's there's one thing that I learned it
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:41,567	| IOT077 |	And then basically
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,359	| IOT077 |	We got a long way to go and smart
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:44,895	| IOT077 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,175	| IOT077 |	But we're getting there
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,711	| IOT077 |	This is a fun
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:49,247	| IOT077 |	Kind of concept as we're
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:52,319	| IOT077 |	Coming up to October 4th which is the
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:55,391	| IOT077 |	David Google is presumably launching Google home
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:56,927	| IOT077 |	Here we should
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:57,951	| IOT077 |	Take a moment for
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:58,975	| IOT077 |	Kevin's disclosure
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:03,839	| IOT077 |	Yep I consult for Google and I do not work on any other Smart Home Products
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:05,887	| IOT077 |	I told any views are my own
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,399	| IOT077 |	And store
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,727	| IOT077 |	I was speaking Google
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:11,007	| IOT077 |	When you talk to Google
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:12,031	| IOT077 |	You don't say that
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:14,847	| IOT077 |	Like when you talk to Amazon you say hey she who shall not be named
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:16,895	| IOT077 |	Hey Siri
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:22,015	| IOT077 |	Sorry if not you're okay cuz
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:25,343	| IOT077 |	Press the buttons on the phone song
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,135	| IOT077 |	For much longer
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:28,927	| IOT077 |	All right
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,695	| IOT077 |	So you have
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,231	| IOT077 |	These women
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:34,303	| IOT077 |	Google
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:35,583	| IOT077 |	Have a name
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:37,375	| IOT077 |	Google home have a name
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:41,471	| IOT077 |	OSHA 12 students assistant have
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:45,823	| IOT077 |	Assisting is what Google calls its AI ever
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:46,847	| IOT077 |	Hertz in
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,383	| IOT077 |	Write the powers
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:48,895	| IOT077 |	When you say
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,943	| IOT077 |	Should I say it ok Google
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:54,015	| IOT077 |	Brexit who doesn't have a
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:56,319	| IOT077 |	A name it's a mean other than the company name
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:17:00,671	| IOT077 |	Right it's a branding thing to me so I don't really have a problem I think
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:04,511	| IOT077 |	I'm very used to eat saying OK Google to my devices
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:06,047	| IOT077 |	I have four I don't know
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,839	| IOT077 |	3ish Warriors how long
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,119	| IOT077 |	It's been out
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:11,423	| IOT077 |	But how if you've got like
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:14,751	| IOT077 |	My phone is almost always around if I say that am I going to set off my phone
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,519	| IOT077 |	Pain in my home
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:17,055	| IOT077 |	That was a question that
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:20,895	| IOT077 |	Many people had a Google IO in Google home was actually showing off we don't
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,687	| IOT077 |	No because
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:25,759	| IOT077 |	They're not going into details about that so
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:28,831	| IOT077 |	Her people don't know you on an Android device
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,879	| IOT077 |	You can have
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:34,719	| IOT077 |	Your phone always listening as well as an Android Wear watch if you raise it
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:37,023	| IOT077 |	You can say OK Google and
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:38,047	| IOT077 |	Korean sauce
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:39,839	| IOT077 |	So how will all this work
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,887	| IOT077 |	But the same keyword is the question
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,167	| IOT077 |	And I don't think that
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:45,215	| IOT077 |	Question has been answered yet so
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,263	| IOT077 |	My suspicions
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:50,335	| IOT077 |	Is yes it will cause conflict
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,871	| IOT077 |	Commence just a guess on my part
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:56,479	| IOT077 |	That's because there's no mechanism in place today to prevent it from multiple
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:59,039	| IOT077 |	Android Wear Android devices
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:02,367	| IOT077 |	Right so unless there's eight some new secret sauce
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,391	| IOT077 |	Hearing Google home
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,671	| IOT077 |	It will be an issue
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,207	| IOT077 |	What about the
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:06,975	| IOT077 |	I always mess up
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,255	| IOT077 |	What is a
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:09,023	| IOT077 |	VSP
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:12,095	| IOT077 |	That Amazon introduced for the
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,119	| IOT077 |	Multiple echos
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:15,679	| IOT077 |	The latest I
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:18,239	| IOT077 |	With room level
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,031	| IOT077 |	Right
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:27,967	| IOT077 |	So yeah so that was announced last week with a. Where if you have multiple Echo devices which she would
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,479	| IOT077 |	And I both do
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:30,015	| IOT077 |	When you speak
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,807	| IOT077 |	Out loud to them
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,855	| IOT077 |	Only one should
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:35,647	| IOT077 |	Listen to take action words today
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:41,791	| IOT077 |	Got me I have two or three of them go at the same time because they can all hear me so my guess is they are then
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:45,631	| IOT077 |	Owning the software to say which is the highest level
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:48,191	| IOT077 |	Up from the microphone and I'm going to presume that
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:51,007	| IOT077 |	The one the person speaking together closest to it
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:54,591	| IOT077 |	So they could do something like that here with Google home
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:55,615	| IOT077 |	Possible
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:59,199	| IOT077 |	Or if knowing a phone is in the house today
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:02,271	| IOT077 |	Are nearby maybe they route everything to the
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:08,927	| IOT077 |	Well I don't know I don't know
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:14,815	| IOT077 |	It gets complex when you start doing things like that because you're relying on so many different potential data points that you may or may not have
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:19,167	| IOT077 |	Agreed but it will actually that goes to what I was going to say
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,703	| IOT077 |	Google
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:22,751	| IOT077 |	Probably does know
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:25,823	| IOT077 |	If your phone has the always listening function on
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:30,687	| IOT077 |	Because all this is tied your Google account and there's Telemetry information that can read
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:33,759	| IOT077 |	So my guess is
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:38,111	| IOT077 |	I'm getting more people than not actually don't have the always listening function on
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,391	| IOT077 |	Japanese
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,671	| IOT077 |	It's not on by default
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,207	| IOT077 |	So typically you have to like
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:45,279	| IOT077 |	To use the function you have to actually go into the
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,047	| IOT077 |	Google app
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:48,607	| IOT077 |	Pour into a Google search screen
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:52,959	| IOT077 |	And from there once it's enabled you can say OK Google it will do
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:53,727	| IOT077 |	Whatever
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:56,287	| IOT077 |	I think very few people have that always listening
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,823	| IOT077 |	Picture on always on their phone
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,639	| IOT077 |	No this was just cuz like
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,687	| IOT077 |	And then there's also the personality
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:04,991	| IOT077 |	I mean I would not
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,527	| IOT077 |	She who shall not
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,343	| IOT077 |	She's getting there
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,879	| IOT077 |	To get their High great as
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:12,415	| IOT077 |	I've never actually
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:19,327	| IOT077 |	Yeah but I like Cortana Lotta Love what Microsoft is down there
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,375	| IOT077 |	NF personality are for sure it's
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:27,775	| IOT077 |	I think she's a really good example of a blend between Siri and Google Now to be quite honest and
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:28,287	| IOT077 |	Play well done
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:35,455	| IOT077 |	I don't know even even on the new today Google released the allo messaging app and that has assistant built in
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,223	| IOT077 |	And as well
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:38,015	| IOT077 |	So that way if you're in a chat
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:41,599	| IOT077 |	You can even make me make a group chat you can do a nap Google
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:48,255	| IOT077 |	In the chat and say show up show me great taco places right and everybody will see the results and we can all decide oh yeah let's go
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:52,351	| IOT077 |	So but there's no name it's just
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:54,143	| IOT077 |	Google it's at Google right
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,935	| IOT077 |	Teuta consistent thing
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:59,263	| IOT077 |	Do we like it or not I don't know I'm guessing you don't you
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,055	| IOT077 |	Just like I just
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,847	| IOT077 |	As you move it
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:05,407	| IOT077 |	A as it becomes more aware of
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:08,223	| IOT077 |	It feels weird
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:09,247	| IOT077 |	To have it be
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:14,111	| IOT077 |	And then also
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:18,464	| IOT077 |	As it's in your house and more people are interacting with it like
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:20,512	| IOT077 |	Yes my daughter will be fine
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:21,024	| IOT077 |	I'm saying
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:24,864	| IOT077 |	Alexa in some ways and I'm sorry
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,632	| IOT077 |	Guys
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:29,216	| IOT077 |	Has become like our arbitrator at the dinner table for exam
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:33,824	| IOT077 |	Pause for a moment
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:34,592	| IOT077 |	Oh wait no
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,408	| IOT077 |	We're like boom
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,688	| IOT077 |	And she's almost got like a seat at the
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,480	| IOT077 |	Inside
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:45,856	| IOT077 |	I totally get that because and doesn't sound stupid when we stayed anyway there many many times just buy
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:46,880	| IOT077 |	Conditioning in
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:50,208	| IOT077 |	And politeness when I'm done speaking to my echo I'll say thank you
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:53,024	| IOT077 |	I wouldn't do that with
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,816	| IOT077 |	Google home I don't
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,352	| IOT077 |	Cuz it's a
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:22:00,192	| IOT077 |	Company it's a brand it's not a personality or a
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:02,752	| IOT077 |	In a person in a in a box
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,264	| IOT077 |	So to speak
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:06,592	| IOT077 |	Flip a person out of the box

EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:33,216	| IOT077 |	And a new service that
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,496	| IOT077 |	Is really
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,008	| IOT077 |	Interesting
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:39,104	| IOT077 |	First a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:45,504	| IOT077 |	This week's monster is macadamia and we are talking about the role of prototypes I have time in the day in for Macadamia
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:49,600	| IOT077 |	And Kevin Bailey the CEO of design first anyone can make a prototype
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:51,392	| IOT077 |	What should I be eating
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:51,904	| IOT077 |	To do when I stop
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:52,928	| IOT077 |	This process
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,720	| IOT077 |	With the maker movement
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:58,048	| IOT077 |	Anyone can build something and deliver a proof-of-concept
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:23:04,448	| IOT077 |	But detected make a prototype that actually looks and feels like the actual product should can get it
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:07,008	| IOT077 |	User passed a Chasm of disbelief
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:12,640	| IOT077 |	Actually touch it and feel it and start thinking about the services that that product can deliver for them
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,408	| IOT077 |	Questions
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,688	| IOT077 |	Should my prototype
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,200	| IOT077 |	Seek to answer
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:17,248	| IOT077 |	It's helping you answer
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:19,552	| IOT077 |	Whether you can make this product desirable
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:22,624	| IOT077 |	And will you be able to make 500 of these and at what cost
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,392	| IOT077 |	And can you
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:27,232	| IOT077 |	Kayla can you deliver it to thousands of users ethical is viral
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:30,304	| IOT077 |	A lot of people think that building a prototype is more just
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:32,096	| IOT077 |	Putting their ideas in physical Hardware
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,888	| IOT077 |	And bring that into show
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:35,936	| IOT077 |	Without thinking about the
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:37,472	| IOT077 |	Future manufacturing viability
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,800	| IOT077 |	Is that really the right way to design something like this
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:44,384	| IOT077 |	The concern there is it if you start moving from makerbase
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:50,784	| IOT077 |	Piece of hardware and try to commercialize it you're going to miss some key elements around security around have you been asked
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:53,856	| IOT077 |	Scale with a platform is with the cloud infrastructure is
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:59,488	| IOT077 |	And by building a prototype on top of the scalable platform from the get-go which the cloud enables
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,536	| IOT077 |	You can actually save a number of iteration
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:02,560	| IOT077 |	And get there
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:07,680	| IOT077 |	For a cheaper and faster
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:08,448	| IOT077 |	Physical
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:09,984	| IOT077 |	And software
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:11,008	| IOT077 |	Virtual based
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:14,848	| IOT077 |	How do we think about bringing those two experiences together
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:16,640	| IOT077 |	The challenge with the hardware
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:18,432	| IOT077 |	Inside wall is
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:20,480	| IOT077 |	To understand limitations
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:21,504	| IOT077 |	Communications
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,856	| IOT077 |	Coin collection of us playthrough
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:31,488	| IOT077 |	Proof of concept where you have a very rich
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:32,000	| IOT077 |	Play
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:35,584	| IOT077 |	Only to find out on the product you going to have to come up with something much
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:41,984	| IOT077 |	Experiential and turn the colors and then size of this playing
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:46,336	| IOT077 |	Concepts
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:46,848	| IOT077 |	Cos2x
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:51,712	| IOT077 |	That way when people experience about accusing optimize around
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:55,040	| IOT077 |	Something still enjoyable within the context of what product
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:55,808	| IOT077 |	Become
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:59,648	| IOT077 |	The whole proof-of-concept is looking at Opportunity risk
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:06,560	| IOT077 |	It's an opportunity with balance the designers are looking at opportunity and then the engineer
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:08,352	| IOT077 |	Earring team is looking at with
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,120	| IOT077 |	And their jobs
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:11,424	| IOT077 |	Change nothing
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:13,216	| IOT077 |	Together any prototyping
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,520	| IOT077 |	You really doing
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:17,312	| IOT077 |	Creation building test
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:17,824	| IOT077 |	Sing learning
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:21,664	| IOT077 |	And that posters get you towards a viable
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:28,832	| IOT077 |	So if you can balance the risk and Designs constraints earlier on in the Prototype phase you'll be able to ski
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:34,464	| IOT077 |	Scale that prototype as it involves and take many of the ideas and Concepts from that prototype into production
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:34,976	| IOT077 |	Commercial
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:37,280	| IOT077 |	Where can we find more
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:43,680	| IOT077 |	Jumpstart your IT solutions go to Macadamia.com JumpStart
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:49,824	| IOT077 |	Hey everybody this is Stacey Higginbotham and you are listening to the internet
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,384	| IOT077 |	We are back with this week
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:55,200	| IOT077 |	Guessed it is John Troutman who is a co-founder at
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,224	| IOT077 |	Neri
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:58,016	| IOT077 |	Hi John how are you doing today
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:01,088	| IOT077 |	Hi Stacy I'm great thanks for having me on the show
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:03,904	| IOT077 |	Thanks for coming I have like the canary forever
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:07,744	| IOT077 |	And by forever I mean like for the last year to have to
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:08,256	| IOT077 |	Sears Helena
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:13,120	| IOT077 |	And that's basically forever yeah yeah
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:17,984	| IOT077 |	Okay so for those of you guys who don't know the canary is an all-in-one security system at this little Lake
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:21,056	| IOT077 |	Black or white cylinder that you stick in your house
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:23,360	| IOT077 |	All these sensors in it
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:26,432	| IOT077 |	And a camera and now Canary you guys are
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:28,992	| IOT077 |	Introducing a whole bunch of new stuff so
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:32,064	| IOT077 |	Starting with everybody's favorite device and outdoor camera
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,344	| IOT077 |	Yay
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:37,440	| IOT077 |	That's right yeah we just announced this week the launch of canary Flex
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:39,744	| IOT077 |	Which is a companion products
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:42,048	| IOT077 |	To Canary and it's an indoor outdoor camera
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:48,192	| IOT077 |	It works plugged in or wire for Isa has built-in rechargeable batteries and it's totally weatherproof so you can use it
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:54,080	| IOT077 |	Spider house you can mount it up on a tree in your front yard you can put in the garage
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:57,408	| IOT077 |	Or you can use it inside in the baby's room or just like
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:58,944	| IOT077 |	The same way you would use Canary indoors
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:00,480	| IOT077 |	Okay so
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:03,296	| IOT077 |	There is like an outdoor camera zeitgeist
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:04,320	| IOT077 |	Right now
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:08,928	| IOT077 |	So you got to talk to me about why you guys decided on this particular
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,976	| IOT077 |	Product because
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:12,768	| IOT077 |	S&S has one
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:14,560	| IOT077 |	Netatmo is launching a new one
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:18,400	| IOT077 |	We just got the ring stick up cams out there
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:20,704	| IOT077 |	I'm trying out these are Lowe's I mean there's
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:23,008	| IOT077 |	There's a lot of outdoor cameras
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,544	| IOT077 |	Yeah when we launched
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:26,592	| IOT077 |	Canary a couple years ago
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:28,640	| IOT077 |	We're really interesting this idea of being
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:35,040	| IOT077 |	What's be connected on the inside of your home in and even if you're on the other side of the world feel like you're inside your home you know what's happening
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:35,808	| IOT077 |	And you have that
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:38,624	| IOT077 |	Immediate connection was happening there
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:42,976	| IOT077 |	I think as soon as people have gotten a taste of that either through Canary or through other Wi-Fi cameras
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:46,560	| IOT077 |	It just makes sense that they wanted to expand that into
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:49,120	| IOT077 |	Even more areas of places they care about
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:50,656	| IOT077 |	So it's an outdoor
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:52,192	| IOT077 |	Security camera but it's also
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:55,008	| IOT077 |	Just a very versatile camera that can go anywhere
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:56,544	| IOT077 |	It's our goal was really to
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,872	| IOT077 |	Take what people are already interested in which is
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,152	| IOT077 |	Can I give me places they care about
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,200	| IOT077 |	And allow that coverage
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:06,272	| IOT077 |	Ensure that connection to go wherever people really wanted to go
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:12,416	| IOT077 |	One of our core tenants has always been to really listen to our community when we launched a crowdfunding product
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:16,000	| IOT077 |	Community became really important to
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:20,864	| IOT077 |	Canary as a company we had about 10,000 people that were immediately kind of bought in and giving us feedback
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:23,680	| IOT077 |	And so as soon as we launched keryflex
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:29,824	| IOT077 |	Got a lot of feedback as far as what what it was doing for people and then what people wanted it to do for them that it wasn't doing yet
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:32,640	| IOT077 |	And one of those things that we heard kind of right away was
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:36,736	| IOT077 |	This desire to take it outside or two to put in other places which the product wasn't
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:37,248	| IOT077 |	Designed to do
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:40,064	| IOT077 |	All right
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:40,576	| IOT077 |	Tumi
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:44,928	| IOT077 |	Not that I don't love outdoor cameras the most exciting thing that you guys are doing
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:46,976	| IOT077 |	Is launching a service Club membership
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:48,000	| IOT077 |	And
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:49,280	| IOT077 |	This is
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:50,048	| IOT077 |	This is
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:53,888	| IOT077 |	Security service in a lot of ways very similar to
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:57,984	| IOT077 |	Like 10 for storage on an ester ring or something like that
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:01,312	| IOT077 |	You guys are taking it a slightly different direction
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:05,920	| IOT077 |	With being able to reimburse people for their deductible
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:08,480	| IOT077 |	In any idea is much more proact
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:10,016	| IOT077 |	I'd love for you to describe
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:10,784	| IOT077 |	The thinking behind
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:11,808	| IOT077 |	Worship
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:15,136	| IOT077 |	Yeah absolutely right now with
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:16,672	| IOT077 |	With Wi-Fi cameras right now
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:18,208	| IOT077 |	Well a lot of what we're seeing is
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:18,720	| IOT077 |	Companies
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:23,072	| IOT077 |	Trying to compete with Who had who got the lowest price for a for video storage
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:26,144	| IOT077 |	Everytime recognizes more like you know we don't want to
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:28,192	| IOT077 |	That's not the game we want to compete at United mean
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:31,520	| IOT077 |	Baidu the idea of
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:32,544	| IOT077 |	Paying for storage
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:36,128	| IOT077 |	Yeah exactly
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:37,664	| IOT077 |	What is you guys design like
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:39,456	| IOT077 |	If that's your plan
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:40,480	| IOT077 |	How does membership
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:40,992	| IOT077 |	I feel that
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:43,296	| IOT077 |	We designed membership to really
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:45,344	| IOT077 |	Go against what all the other what other
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:48,416	| IOT077 |	Wi-Fi cameras are offering it's it's not based on
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:51,232	| IOT077 |	Video storage is based on benefits that
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:52,768	| IOT077 |	That are
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:54,048	| IOT077 |	Really designed to give you
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,584	| IOT077 |	Better security and
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:59,680	| IOT077 |	Have Canary work with you if you do have a security or an emergency incident
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:03,776	| IOT077 |	So that starts with a dedicated and incident support agent
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:06,080	| IOT077 |	So as a canary member we actually
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:07,104	| IOT077 |	We have dedicated
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:08,640	| IOT077 |	Supporting us that will work with you
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:12,736	| IOT077 |	2 and hold your hand really through if they're everything you need to do in the case of
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,528	| IOT077 |	You have your home burglarized
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:20,672	| IOT077 |	It's crazy because when we when we launched Canary we've seen we have discussion Hunter the discussions of people that have
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:22,208	| IOT077 |	Just had their home burglarized
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:26,048	| IOT077 |	You stay as I don't have any sexy have you ever
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:29,376	| IOT077 |	I don't even want to say it cuz what if someone shows up but
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,400	| IOT077 |	But yeah
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:32,448	| IOT077 |	As you might imagine it's very like
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:35,520	| IOT077 |	Scary and Adam Panos
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:39,872	| IOT077 |	It's a difficult situation to go to a people out of time people are kind of like scrambling to figure out
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:46,272	| IOT077 |	It what I do what's the what's the right steps how do I how do I manage this process you feel very like violated when it happens and so what we
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:49,344	| IOT077 |	One of the four things we designer Canary membership is how do we
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,624	| IOT077 |	Actually be an active
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:52,672	| IOT077 |	Participant wenzhou users and help them through that
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:54,208	| IOT077 |	How come to that process
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:56,000	| IOT077 |	So
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:58,048	| IOT077 |	So this this feature having a
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:04,960	| IOT077 |	Dedicated incident report person that we can actually hop on the phone with you and help you know here's the information needed
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:05,728	| IOT077 |	Connecticut police
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:09,824	| IOT077 |	Kira is at here's how you handle working with your insurance company
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:12,128	| IOT077 |	Especially walking through every step of that process
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:14,944	| IOT077 |	So before like right after I called nine-one-one I should call Kenny
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:22,112	| IOT077 |	Yeah I mean obviously the first thing you should you do it you should do is call 911 actually use the canary out to disconnect with the police
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:23,392	| IOT077 |	And then you know once
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,928	| IOT077 |	Once you do that will actually walk
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:28,768	| IOT077 |	Things you can do we can go in and help you you know
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:29,536	| IOT077 |	Access
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:31,584	| IOT077 |	Nav other information that you might
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:33,376	| IOT077 |	Need from the canary app as far as
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:36,448	| IOT077 |	You know exact timestamp when things happen
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:39,264	| IOT077 |	And then we can actually work if you have a really strong about
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:40,800	| IOT077 |	State Farm
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:43,872	| IOT077 |	And and other insurance agencies
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:48,736	| IOT077 |	So I can walk you through the best process of how you work with your insurance company and then on top of that we actually
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:53,088	| IOT077 |	Do as for Canary members we reimburse you for your insurance deductible
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:59,488	| IOT077 |	So you know that your insurance will cover everything after you pay your deductible will actually reimburse you for that deductible so if your
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:01,792	| IOT077 |	I'll miss burglarizing your Canary number
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:03,328	| IOT077 |	I'm going to be out of pocket
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,608	| IOT077 |	Anything that has well
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,376	| IOT077 |	Pepper that for you
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:06,656	| IOT077 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:07,168	| IOT077 |	That's
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:11,264	| IOT077 |	That's an interesting idea because it feels like
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,800	| IOT077 |	The canary
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:15,360	| IOT077 |	The canary in a lot of these cameras not just connect
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:16,640	| IOT077 |	Feels like
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:20,736	| IOT077 |	Something I could use after I've been burglarized but not something that
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:21,248	| IOT077 |	Pitstop app
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:24,320	| IOT077 |	So what am I missing
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:29,184	| IOT077 |	Cuz I'm paying my deductible
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:31,744	| IOT077 |	Will not actually we're not even worried that you're going
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:36,864	| IOT077 |	Yeah it's it is interesting security companies I think have
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:38,912	| IOT077 |	Failed to come
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:41,984	| IOT077 |	Complete the circle of life protecting you before an incident
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:44,288	| IOT077 |	During an incident and after its incident
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:46,336	| IOT077 |	Often times it's only
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,616	| IOT077 |	Kind of like part of that
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:48,896	| IOT077 |	And so we've actually
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,944	| IOT077 |	Designed Canary in the canary
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:54,272	| IOT077 |	Experience to help you in all three of those cases so
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:55,552	| IOT077 |	It's before an incident
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:58,880	| IOT077 |	Can I give you an insight into what's happening your home let you be connected to your home
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:01,696	| IOT077 |	During an incident will send you a notification
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:04,512	| IOT077 |	Allow you to sound the siren that's built into the device
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:06,560	| IOT077 |	Connect to the police duty app
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:09,632	| IOT077 |	And then after the incident that's really working right memberships comes in
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:11,424	| IOT077 |	Are we helping you can't manage that process
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:14,752	| IOT077 |	That's really complaining that circle before during and after
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:16,288	| IOT077 |	The circular
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:19,104	| IOT077 |	Crisis I'm sure that's not your
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:22,176	| IOT077 |	How to say idea
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:24,992	| IOT077 |	I am fascinated by this idea
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:31,648	| IOT077 |	People who are building Hardware recognizing that iot is really about services and so I love membership because it's
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:33,440	| IOT077 |	A really interesting service
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:35,232	| IOT077 |	How did you guys go
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:39,072	| IOT077 |	Come to this idea that you needed to deliver a service or was it always there
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:41,888	| IOT077 |	I mean I think a lot of it is coming
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,168	| IOT077 |	Come to
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:45,728	| IOT077 |	Come from recognizing that
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:46,752	| IOT077 |	So many
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:48,800	| IOT077 |	Subscription plans that
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:50,336	| IOT077 |	Coming in not even just talking
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,360	| IOT077 |	In the
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:54,176	| IOT077 |	Subscription plans
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:55,968	| IOT077 |	Tech companies are usually about
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:58,016	| IOT077 |	How do we strip away some features
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:00,064	| IOT077 |	Put it behind a paywall somebody has to
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:03,136	| IOT077 |	Has to have a transactional relationship with us and pay us
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:04,672	| IOT077 |	You know what I mean
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:08,512	| IOT077 |	It's like how do we how do we make the free experience or product not good enough
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:10,304	| IOT077 |	They have to pay us so we here
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:11,584	| IOT077 |	Ensure
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:14,144	| IOT077 |	Yeah we're like
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:17,216	| IOT077 |	I mean
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:18,240	| IOT077 |	Most up
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:21,568	| IOT077 |	Most companies that do the state don't have like a son of a freemium
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:22,848	| IOT077 |	Then where
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:24,128	| IOT077 |	Shirley Spotify
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:24,896	| IOT077 |	Yeah like Spotify
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:26,688	| IOT077 |	Adam
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:30,016	| IOT077 |	Or even even other connected home cameras are products like
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:35,904	| IOT077 |	You know you have a little bit and then after a month all the sudden you like oh that's the product I bought I thought it was going to do all this other stuff
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:42,048	| IOT077 |	And we don't we don't want that kind of relationship with our customers we don't want to transactional relationship we actually want
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:45,888	| IOT077 |	A relationship where we're going to be there for you and help you and so
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:46,912	| IOT077 |	Service plans to us
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:48,448	| IOT077 |	We didn't want to come
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:49,216	| IOT077 |	Key.
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:49,984	| IOT077 |	Hayward's going to make
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:51,776	| IOT077 |	Cheaper and cheaper storage
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:54,848	| IOT077 |	But keep it behind a paywall to where you have to do it
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:56,640	| IOT077 |	What other things
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,944	| IOT077 |	Can we offer that would be meaningful that would actually
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:04,832	| IOT077 |	Frito-Lay relationship that exist longer than them purchasing us selling their products and then
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:07,392	| IOT077 |	Maybe it's hanging up paying us on a monthly basis
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:10,976	| IOT077 |	Cancel membership came from that it's like how do we actually
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:14,304	| IOT077 |	Hold hands with our users through things that could be difficult for them
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:18,400	| IOT077 |	It reminds me a lot of AAA so you could obviously drive a car
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,168	| IOT077 |	Without
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:19,936	| IOT077 |	Having a membership in
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:22,752	| IOT077 |	If you have it so
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:23,776	| IOT077 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,824	| IOT077 |	Also underlying
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:26,592	| IOT077 |	The whole
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,360	| IOT077 |	Membership
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:31,968	| IOT077 |	Platform that we built is this idea of a Marketplace instead of underneath that right
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:35,552	| IOT077 |	That initially there's these three benefits that come
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:37,856	| IOT077 |	With membership for because it also
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:38,624	| IOT077 |	Include
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:41,696	| IOT077 |	Stop 38th and video history and unlimited downloads
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:42,976	| IOT077 |	Now there is a storage
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:44,768	| IOT077 |	Yeah but it's like
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:47,328	| IOT077 |	You know we kind of take it off a table cuz it's like
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:48,096	| IOT077 |	Call
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:49,120	| IOT077 |	Is the whole month of
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:49,888	| IOT077 |	A video storage
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:52,192	| IOT077 |	I'm ready downloads no data caps
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:57,312	| IOT077 |	Add rat like tearing it like pay this much I pay this much more to get more storage just just
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:59,360	| IOT077 |	Built in there that's not really even
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:01,408	| IOT077 |	That's not the core focus of it
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:04,992	| IOT077 |	So with the marketplace are these going to be
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,272	| IOT077 |	Mostly security
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:09,344	| IOT077 |	Focused in oriented or is it going to also
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:12,928	| IOT077 |	Build upon Lake dictionary for example has air quality
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:14,208	| IOT077 |	And
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:16,000	| IOT077 |	Sensors in
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:17,792	| IOT077 |	I don't know what else you could build with that but
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:18,560	| IOT077 |	I'm sure someone's created
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:24,192	| IOT077 |	Yeah I mean there's really no limit to what they can be our our Focus
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:27,264	| IOT077 |	Has been out of the gate to make sure that we're offering
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:29,056	| IOT077 |	Time cover security that's been
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:30,592	| IOT077 |	Core focus our company
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:32,384	| IOT077 |	Manticore promised to our users
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:34,176	| IOT077 |	But if there's definitely
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:36,224	| IOT077 |	Potential in an opportunity to a lot
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:38,272	| IOT077 |	Opportunity to do a lot more
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:42,624	| IOT077 |	And I wish I could tell you everything we know that but there's definitely going to be some
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:45,440	| IOT077 |	More exciting things coming through the marketplace in the future
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:46,208	| IOT077 |	I
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:46,720	| IOT077 |	I cannot wait for that
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:47,744	| IOT077 |	So
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:50,560	| IOT077 |	Go it looking forward to
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:51,072	| IOT077 |	In your company
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:53,376	| IOT077 |	Your focus is on security
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:54,400	| IOT077 |	Usell
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:59,264	| IOT077 |	Couple pieces of Hardware you got your existing Canary you got the flex
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:01,056	| IOT077 |	Got some accessories to go with that
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:04,384	| IOT077 |	What percentage of your business is going to be
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,920	| IOT077 |	Services versus hard
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:08,736	| IOT077 |	Yeah I mean I think we should consider ourselves
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:11,040	| IOT077 |	In the services business PCS
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:15,136	| IOT077 |	Dabbing built a thing here that we can build
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:16,416	| IOT077 |	Continue to build upon
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:17,696	| IOT077 |	And really offer a lot
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:18,976	| IOT077 |	Tree services at Canobie
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:20,000	| IOT077 |	Corridor business
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:21,280	| IOT077 |	That being said
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:25,120	| IOT077 |	Where is very very design-driven Product Company
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:26,656	| IOT077 |	And the hardware is
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:29,216	| IOT077 |	Is just as important as anything else
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:33,824	| IOT077 |	We're not we're not in the business of how do we get how do we make cheaper and cheaper components
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,104	| IOT077 |	And then
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:37,408	| IOT077 |	And just tell those so that we can do services
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:40,736	| IOT077 |	It's really like all tied together for us like we're
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:42,016	| IOT077 |	We're committed to
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:43,808	| IOT077 |	Delivering really high quality
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:45,088	| IOT077 |	Hardware wood
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:46,112	| IOT077 |	Nazi from
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:49,184	| IOT077 |	All the companies in the states so that's something that's very important to us
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:50,208	| IOT077 |	We're very focused on
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:54,304	| IOT077 |	Doing a really great user experience through your mobile app
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:58,144	| IOT077 |	I'm in now with membership we're showing that we're going to level up some
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:01,984	| IOT077 |	Step up our game when it comes to Services Sarasota Trulia
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:03,520	| IOT077 |	All three of those things together for us
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:07,616	| IOT077 |	What would make in your mind membership successful like what kind of
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:11,200	| IOT077 |	I don't know acceptance rate among your users or
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:15,808	| IOT077 |	I have no idea what how are you going to judge the success of them
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:16,320	| IOT077 |	Membership
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:21,184	| IOT077 |	We judge the success of a level lot of what we do
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,208	| IOT077 |	Bust through
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:27,840	| IOT077 |	Quantitative stuff but also qualitatively a lot and we spent a lot of time reaching out to
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:28,864	| IOT077 |	Our user base
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:31,680	| IOT077 |	That's a lot of the success in my mind is going to come from
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:34,496	| IOT077 |	Actually talking to our community and hearing from them
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:35,776	| IOT077 |	If we delivered
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:37,824	| IOT077 |	What we believe is a needs they have
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:39,104	| IOT077 |	We want to hear that from our users
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:41,920	| IOT077 |	With your products
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:46,784	| IOT077 |	I've got to ask this poem kid has become a bigger deal especially with the launch of iOS 10
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:47,808	| IOT077 |	And the home app
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:51,136	| IOT077 |	And you guys a couple months ago said that you
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:53,952	| IOT077 |	We're going to release a second-generation Canary product
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:54,976	| IOT077 |	It was homekit compatible
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:56,256	| IOT077 |	Yes yes
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:57,792	| IOT077 |	So
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:59,584	| IOT077 |	When can we expect that
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:00,864	| IOT077 |	Or do you want to give us an update
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:01,888	| IOT077 |	On the home
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:06,240	| IOT077 |	Sure sure yeah we are we have been working with apple on this actually
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:08,032	| IOT077 |	For a little while it's if it's been
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:08,544	| IOT077 |	Good
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:11,104	| IOT077 |	Fun process working with them as they've been
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:14,688	| IOT077 |	Trapping to announce if they recently did the home platform
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:18,784	| IOT077 |	We have the beginning of next year when we watching was called Canary Plus
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:22,112	| IOT077 |	Which is the next generation of the of our first
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:24,672	| IOT077 |	System
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:29,536	| IOT077 |	Entire place was going to be as a pumpkin chicken batter Bowl
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:31,584	| IOT077 |	And we think for at least at least
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:33,120	| IOT077 |	A subset of our users
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:34,656	| IOT077 |	I'm nothing to you
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:36,448	| IOT077 |	Kevin exciting and meaningful addition
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:40,800	| IOT077 |	Guess I'm sure it will be could you bridge from one Canary to the other
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:41,824	| IOT077 |	You're old Canary to the
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:42,336	| IOT077 |	Canary
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:45,920	| IOT077 |	What are there all accessible through the same
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:47,200	| IOT077 |	A map of course
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:48,992	| IOT077 |	Homekit
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:51,040	| IOT077 |	Ship that you're at the harborage if you put in the product
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:53,600	| IOT077 |	That makes it home kit accessible
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:57,952	| IOT077 |	Doesn't mean you can't pull in a video feed from a different
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:01,536	| IOT077 |	So I could I could see that one
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:02,816	| IOT077 |	Made in the home app
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,656	| IOT077 |	Which means I'll be hanging out
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:07,168	| IOT077 |	Still in the canary
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:09,984	| IOT077 |	In the flex camera
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:11,008	| IOT077 |	And is that
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:14,592	| IOT077 |	Careflex isn't at this time
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:16,384	| IOT077 |	Okay
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:17,920	| IOT077 |	Chine
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:22,784	| IOT077 |	Thank you so much for coming on the show I'm excited to see you guys evolved
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:25,088	| IOT077 |	We need to talk about computer vision
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:31,232	| IOT077 |	But it lets go back just one step
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:33,024	| IOT077 |	Cuz I I do want to actually
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:36,608	| IOT077 |	You guys have actually been one of the Pioneers in
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:37,888	| IOT077 |	Deep learning computer vision
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:38,912	| IOT077 |	To your camera Prada
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:42,240	| IOT077 |	And I remember training Maya camera
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:43,520	| IOT077 |	When I first tried this thing
EDL	00:40:44,032	00:40:46,848	| IOT077 |	For like weeks I was like that's my dog that's my dog
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:47,872	| IOT077 |	That's my dawg
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:50,688	| IOT077 |	I'm in the night I realized that wasn't it
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:52,992	| IOT077 |	Be at it for a while but now it's out
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:54,784	| IOT077 |	Side hurts your face
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:40:58,624	| IOT077 |	How does it how is
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:00,928	| IOT077 |	That playing out for your users
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:01,952	| IOT077 |	Something there is
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:02,464	| IOT077 |	Excited about
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:08,608	| IOT077 |	Yeah and what school actually what you were doing Stacy and and you were one of the thousands of people that were doing that
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:14,240	| IOT077 |	It wasn't just training your device that was actually training are back in system to recognize things that were
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:17,568	| IOT077 |	Caribbean clustered on the back end and needed labels but that's them
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:21,152	| IOT077 |	So what we've been doing from the beginning is
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:22,432	| IOT077 |	From when it first launched it is
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:27,040	| IOT077 |	Trying to have the system I learned identify and recognize patterns
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:29,088	| IOT077 |	In home environments that could then be
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:30,368	| IOT077 |	Filter out if they're not import
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:32,672	| IOT077 |	And so over the past few months
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:33,696	| IOT077 |	We watching a movie
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:38,560	| IOT077 |	Speakers some of them are user-facing and some of them just happened in the background to make the product better for our users
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:40,864	| IOT077 |	In a sentence
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:42,656	| IOT077 |	Has been really great as far as
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:44,448	| IOT077 |	Users noticing a difference getting
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:46,752	| IOT077 |	Fewer and fewer false alerts things that they're not in
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:51,104	| IOT077 |	And more attention to the things that they actually want to be notified about
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:42:00,319	| IOT077 |	Spider dog or for some people it cuz we haven't we actually built sensitivity slider that's in the app
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:04,415	| IOT077 |	I'm so some people actually took a slider over to where they get
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:06,463	| IOT077 |	Fewer alerts Madrid actually filter out
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:06,975	| IOT077 |	Pets
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:09,535	| IOT077 |	The canary actually caught my dogs
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:10,559	| IOT077 |	On my bed
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:14,911	| IOT077 |	That's good for you yet
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:16,703	| IOT077 |	Awesome okay
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:18,751	| IOT077 |	Thank you so much for coming on the show today
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:22,079	| IOT077 |	It's my pleasure thank you so much for having me
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:28,991	| IOT077 |	Well that's it for this week's show thank you so much for listening and we'll see you again next week
