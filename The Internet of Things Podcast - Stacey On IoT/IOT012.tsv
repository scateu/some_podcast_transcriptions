EDL	00:00:08,704	00:00:11,520	| IOT012 |	Hey everyone you're listening to The Internet of Things show and I am your host
EDL	00:00:12,032	00:00:14,080	| IOT012 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:14,592	00:00:15,616	| IOT012 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:15,616	00:00:17,664	| IOT012 |	And I'm talking about
EDL	00:00:18,944	00:00:19,712	| IOT012 |	Teachers in the Smart Home
EDL	00:00:20,480	00:00:23,040	| IOT012 |	Industrial internet Consortium testbed
EDL	00:00:25,344	00:00:26,112	| IOT012 |	Bliss hub
EDL	00:00:26,624	00:00:30,720	| IOT012 |	And the Brit
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:32,512	| IOT012 |	So Kevin are we ready
EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:37,120	| IOT012 |	We are ready as long as you don't talk about a hub github
EDL	00:00:37,632	00:00:38,656	| IOT012 |	You know the article
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:39,680	| IOT012 |	Who says
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:42,752	| IOT012 |	Alright so we're getting ahead of ourselves
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:43,264	| IOT012 |	Express
EDL	00:00:43,776	00:00:47,104	| IOT012 |	We want to start off with a story from wired that I actually thought was
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:47,616	| IOT012 |	Really
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:52,224	| IOT012 |	Encapsulated a lot of things
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:53,760	| IOT012 |	The story
EDL	00:00:53,760	00:00:54,272	| IOT012 |	Is basically
EDL	00:00:54,784	00:00:57,088	| IOT012 |	It's my David Pierce and it talks about how
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:01:02,720	| IOT012 |	At WWDC Apple introduced a bunch of features that we've already seen before and how all the features on
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:05,280	| IOT012 |	Form separately coalesce
EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:07,840	| IOT012 |	I think what got David thinking about this was
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:12,960	| IOT012 |	The the big one more thing Apple which was Apple music obvious that's not related
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:14,752	| IOT012 |	But it really hits the point that
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:16,800	| IOT012 |	Hey everybody else has a music service
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:19,360	| IOT012 |	To what why was this one more thing
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:20,128	| IOT012 |	As you said
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:22,944	| IOT012 |	Mobile platforms have matured so much
EDL	00:01:23,456	00:01:24,224	| IOT012 |	Pretty much
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:27,296	| IOT012 |	All the same in some sense may be different implementations
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:28,064	| IOT012 |	I think so I think about
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:30,880	| IOT012 |	But they're all the same so how does that apply to
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:31,392	| IOT012 |	Startups
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:33,696	| IOT012 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:35,232	| IOT012 |	Because nothing about any of my smart home stuff is
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:42,144	| IOT012 |	In thinking about kind of the news that we've had I think that there are a couple things that everyone's kind of gravity
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:44,192	| IOT012 |	And we're not there yet
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:45,984	| IOT012 |	Right now we're all at the end of Lake
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:48,544	| IOT012 |	One app to control multiple
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,056	| IOT012 |	Devices
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:51,872	| IOT012 |	So we see a lot of those being integrated where you can
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:52,384	| IOT012 |	Control
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:53,920	| IOT012 |	Your lights
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:54,688	| IOT012 |	From
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:55,456	| IOT012 |	Ihob
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,736	| IOT012 |	Like a SmartThings aura
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,784	| IOT012 |	Staples connect kind of
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:01:59,296	| IOT012 |	App
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:04,416	| IOT012 |	Where everyone is pretty clear that we're going is all these devices will eventually
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,440	| IOT012 |	Talk to one another
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:07,744	| IOT012 |	I think the difference is our
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,256	| IOT012 |	How they're going to
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,560	| IOT012 |	So
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:12,608	| IOT012 |	One of the big things that I've seen is
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:14,144	| IOT012 |	We're going to be
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,168	| IOT012 |	Fighting over
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:17,216	| IOT012 |	Services in the cloud or services in the home
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:21,568	| IOT012 |	And that's actually something that we talked about many times before because
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:25,920	| IOT012 |	Turn off we stand on different sides of that but I know from an implementation standpoint
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:27,456	| IOT012 |	I prefer to have my stuff
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:28,480	| IOT012 |	Local
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:29,760	| IOT012 |	Which on a device
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:30,784	| IOT012 |	Rather than
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,808	| IOT012 |	In the cloud
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:32,576	| IOT012 |	Where
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,624	| IOT012 |	Making my sins are program in the cloud
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,904	| IOT012 |	Can I have no
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:41,024	| IOT012 |	Internet connectivity for some reason and my scenes don't happen because the cloud didn't say make the same time
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,048	| IOT012 |	Exactly
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:47,424	| IOT012 |	The actual implementation will take place in both locally and the cloud
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:49,984	| IOT012 |	Like a light switches that should be local
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,008	| IOT012 |	Because there's too much latency
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:52,800	| IOT012 |	Right
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,848	| IOT012 |	You should have some of your basic programming
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,640	| IOT012 |	Auto local hub
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,688	| IOT012 |	Because yes if your internet goes down Sudley Road
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,480	| IOT012 |	Oh crap
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:00,992	| IOT012 |	Nothing works
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:09,952	| IOT012 |	When the sun sets or 3 hours before the sun sets
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:12,512	| IOT012 |	Take my shades down a notch
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,792	| IOT012 |	That's the kind of stuff
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:16,608	| IOT012 |	But you're going to need Cloud access for because presumably
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:19,168	| IOT012 |	The time of day that the sunsets is going to live
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:24,032	| IOT012 |	Maybe because I actually have that exact
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,824	| IOT012 |	I'll call it a recipe or seen
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:29,920	| IOT012 |	Had it on my insteon server and the server used
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:34,528	| IOT012 |	Anybody dress each day how many minutes before sunrise sunset
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:37,088	| IOT012 |	So could be local but I suspect yes most
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:39,136	| IOT012 |	People would would need Cloud for that
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:44,256	| IOT012 |	What is an architectural decision you can make you can actually download
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:46,048	| IOT012 |	Like once a day
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:47,584	| IOT012 |	Your server checks in and
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,608	| IOT012 |	Posen weather
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,376	| IOT012 |	Time
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:54,496	| IOT012 |	Point of light switches and latency and so on and
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,776	| IOT012 |	I mean I don't want to have to
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:04:00,128	| IOT012 |	Have a signal goes thousands of miles and then come back just to turn on the light switch
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,152	| IOT012 |	Being silly
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,688	| IOT012 |	I think
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:04,480	| IOT012 |	We'll see what happens over there
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:08,320	| IOT012 |	I think you're right where you had said
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,368	| IOT012 |	Could be maybe a combination
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:14,976	| IOT012 |	And by that I mean maybe you have all of your local controls will your controls local
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,536	| IOT012 |	And your rules local but sync
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:20,351	| IOT012 |	We're stored in the cloud as midi a backup copy
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,655	| IOT012 |	And therefore you could have come like a hybrid Model A
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:25,727	| IOT012 |	Depending on which made the most sense to use the time it would just
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:30,079	| IOT012 |	Alright so we got the hybrid model and I was thinking more control
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:32,127	| IOT012 |	Are you going to talk to your house or you going to
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,407	| IOT012 |	Show interface
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:34,431	| IOT012 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,711	| IOT012 |	Interface
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,295	| IOT012 |	Wise guy said
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:44,671	| IOT012 |	Back in 2011 when Siri first came out because really that was the big first of all say
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:47,487	| IOT012 |	Boise personal assistant type software that hit mainstream
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:52,351	| IOT012 |	Tammy voice was going to be at some point in future the invisible interface
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,631	| IOT012 |	Because it's
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:57,727	| IOT012 |	Comment if the most common interface I think there is as opposed to
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:00,799	| IOT012 |	Dealing with touch screens and keyboards and mice and
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,079	| IOT012 |	Switches and
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:04,127	| IOT012 |	Wall panels in Solon
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:06,431	| IOT012 |	Also present some of the biggest
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:06,943	| IOT012 |	Challenges
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:10,527	| IOT012 |	In terms of natural language processing
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:15,391	| IOT012 |	Then again going back up to the cloud and there's a lot of things lot of moving Parts there that have to work
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,671	| IOT012 |	So
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,719	| IOT012 |	I don't think it was going to be an overnight
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,487	| IOT012 |	Interface
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,303	| IOT012 |	But I do think in the Long Haul
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,327	| IOT012 |	I think it's going to be voice
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:23,839	| IOT012 |	In the home
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,119	| IOT012 |	Maybe not everywhere
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:28,191	| IOT012 |	When you're out and about
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,471	| IOT012 |	Sitting around on a
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,007	| IOT012 |	Subway or bus
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:33,567	| IOT012 |	You're not going to use voice for everything
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,847	| IOT012 |	Examples for interact
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,639	| IOT012 |	There's lots of people around you and
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:39,199	| IOT012 |	And someone is just not going to work as well in the home though I can see it
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:42,527	| IOT012 |	Are physical
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:44,319	| IOT012 |	Presence is going to be a huge
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,647	| IOT012 |	A way that we interface with device
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:50,207	| IOT012 |	Even if it's like a secondary layer that
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:54,815	| IOT012 |	Voice or touch screens or anything else I think
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:58,655	| IOT012 |	Our physical presence is going to be noted enough in the home that
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:05:59,935	| IOT012 |	It will
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:04,287	| IOT012 |	Respond like oh is she's turning if she says turn on the lights and she's in this room
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:07,615	| IOT012 |	It's like a 98% probability she wants the lights
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,943	| IOT012 |	It gets axle that gets into the next
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:13,247	| IOT012 |	Peace that I wanted to talk about and it's contacts
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,783	| IOT012 |	Because contacts has a huge part of this
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:17,343	| IOT012 |	You got your sensors to gather the data
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,623	| IOT012 |	What is the context that
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:21,695	| IOT012 |	Case today that makes Intelligent Decisions based on the sensor data
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,487	| IOT012 |	But
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:27,839	| IOT012 |	And this gets back to the everybody's the same in some sense and in some ways they're not
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,375	| IOT012 |	Platforms and IRT
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:32,959	| IOT012 |	You got to give up information in order to provide
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,471	| IOT012 |	Contacts
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:36,031	| IOT012 |	And a lot of people are still not
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,799	| IOT012 |	Comfortable with that
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,847	| IOT012 |	Yes so there is
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,615	| IOT012 |	There's actually
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:42,175	| IOT012 |	A big kerfuffle today in the world because
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:45,247	| IOT012 |	We haven't used it yet that's a good one
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:47,295	| IOT012 |	Alright big kerfuffle right now in
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:50,111	| IOT012 |	Privacy kind of sphere because
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:52,671	| IOT012 |	With facial-recognition happening
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,975	| IOT012 |	More often in Facebook launching a platform
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,535	| IOT012 |	On this week called moments that uses
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,327	| IOT012 |	Facial recognition to Kinder
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,607	| IOT012 |	Auto tag
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,655	| IOT012 |	Your friends and help you share content among them
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:07,263	| IOT012 |	Which Google actually does to now with its new Google photos it does a lot of facial recognition stuff
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:07,775	| IOT012 |	Exactly
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:13,407	| IOT012 |	We anticipate the Dropcam actually Nest Dropcam uses facial
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:15,455	| IOT012 |	Recognition or has the ability to use facial
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,223	| IOT012 |	Recognition
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:17,759	| IOT012 |	And so does the
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:19,295	| IOT012 |	We're going to talk about later
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:21,087	| IOT012 |	In the Privacy Arena
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,135	| IOT012 |	What happened is the
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:23,903	| IOT012 |	Ntia
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,439	| IOT012 |	Which is a government
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:28,255	| IOT012 |	It's the national telecommunications and Information Administration
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:35,167	| IOT012 |	They were trying to work with industry and privacy groups to create this voluntary code of conduct around how people are going to use
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,935	| IOT012 |	Facial recognition data
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:38,495	| IOT012 |	And the privacy
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,543	| IOT012 |	Oriented groups basically left
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:43,359	| IOT012 |	Stealing like they weren't being heard and that the companies
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,127	| IOT012 |	We're not going to
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:44,895	| IOT012 |	Implement any standards
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,431	| IOT012 |	While
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:49,247	| IOT012 |	I can understand why the Privacy groups are
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:49,759	| IOT012 |	Concerned
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:54,111	| IOT012 |	But I almost think that you can't have it both ways you can't have
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:57,183	| IOT012 |	The intelligence that devices can provide
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,743	| IOT012 |	Without giving them more and more information
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:03,071	| IOT012 |	It should be out there not obviously I mean I don't think
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:03,839	| IOT012 |	People shouldn't just
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,887	| IOT012 |	Say I'm stuck with it.
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:06,911	| IOT012 |	You know you can not buy
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:10,751	| IOT012 |	In the end especially at the younger generation
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:14,591	| IOT012 |	Pretty much. He's convenience of a privacy as soon as I get older I don't think
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:18,175	| IOT012 |	I don't think it will be as big as a kerfuffle
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:19,711	| IOT012 |	In the future in the cities today
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:21,247	| IOT012 |	I hope you're right
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:27,391	| IOT012 |	I do think we should be having a good kind of in-depth discussion about this and I'm sure we're actually going to get someone on a podcast
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:30,463	| IOT012 |	In a couple weeks who's going to have this in-depth discussion
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:32,767	| IOT012 |	In the meantime
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,815	| IOT012 |	Context is one of kind of
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:38,399	| IOT012 |	The core things that we think are smart home platform will need
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:41,471	| IOT012 |	I think programmability like how we program it
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,751	| IOT012 |	Is going to have to change
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:45,567	| IOT012 |	And so I'm really interested I don't think we know how that's going to happen
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,615	| IOT012 |	If it's going to be kind of a
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:49,663	| IOT012 |	Data-driven model where like
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,455	| IOT012 |	When you plug in a device
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:55,551	| IOT012 |	Suggest like I see you have the following other devices would you like to hook us up and do this
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:58,367	| IOT012 |	Or if it's going to be more programmatic like
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:58,879	| IOT012 |	If this then that
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:01,183	| IOT012 |	So I think that's still up in the air
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:03,231	| IOT012 |	I think we're heading towards the former
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,535	| IOT012 |	Example though I do think that
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:09,631	| IOT012 |	The companies that really want to push IRT or trying to make the devices
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,679	| IOT012 |	Work with each other with
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,471	| IOT012 |	Far less interaction
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,031	| IOT012 |	I agree
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:21,919	| IOT012 |	The other question is how people get it are they going to buy it from a service provider or an alarm company or
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,479	| IOT012 |	Best Buy in Amazon
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,551	| IOT012 |	Actually really legit
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:32,415	| IOT012 |	We're all over the map their personal am I'm a DIY guy so I don't want
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,719	| IOT012 |	Companies that
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:36,511	| IOT012 |	Modern Fusion
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:40,095	| IOT012 |	And controlling and even access to that data potentially that
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,631	| IOT012 |	We don't want them to have some
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,679	| IOT012 |	Now it says convenience versus cost
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:51,103	| IOT012 |	Thinking about to get some input from you guys if you have any thoughts
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:53,919	| IOT012 |	At
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:54,943	| IOT012 |	Starcom
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:55,967	| IOT012 |	And
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:59,039	| IOT012 |	Next up is the industrial internet Consortium
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,599	| IOT012 |	Do you remember these guys
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:03,391	| IOT012 |	They are launched last year at
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:06,463	| IOT012 |	Was GE Cisco
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:09,791	| IOT012 |	The president the White House
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,839	| IOT012 |	Saying hey
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:14,399	| IOT012 |	We're doing this industrial internet Consortium
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:14,911	| IOT012 |	It'll be great
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:16,959	| IOT012 |	Nobody knew what it was
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:17,983	| IOT012 |	Including me
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:24,127	| IOT012 |	I first saw the news I tried to figure out what they were doing a conclusion that this was just a
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,151	| IOT012 |	The standards organization
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:25,663	| IOT012 |	Entrenched
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:28,991	| IOT012 |	How did you really feel about
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,039	| IOT012 |	That's true
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,111	| IOT012 |	Today
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:34,879	| IOT012 |	Are this week
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,671	| IOT012 |	Released their first
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:40,255	| IOT012 |	I guess we'll call a product it's actually a test bed that's been built by
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:41,791	| IOT012 |	EMC and Vodafone
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,839	| IOT012 |	And it's in Ireland
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,375	| IOT012 |	And what they're doing is there
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:47,679	| IOT012 |	Basically creating a virtual
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,471	| IOT012 |	33 data centers
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:50,239	| IOT012 |	And they're creating
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:55,615	| IOT012 |	The appearance of one data center basically so you could send data and it doesn't really matter where it goes
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,639	| IOT012 |	Switch Data Center
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:11:00,223	| IOT012 |	And idea
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,271	| IOT012 |	The first kind of use case is
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,551	| IOT012 |	Platform called Blue Light
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:05,855	| IOT012 |	And what it will do is
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,903	| IOT012 |	If someone is in an ambulance
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,463	| IOT012 |	It will take the data from
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:12,255	| IOT012 |	Ambulance and send it to the hospital
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:15,071	| IOT012 |	They're going to so you'll get the patient data
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,607	| IOT012 |	Water on
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,631	| IOT012 |	Route basically to the
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,167	| IOT012 |	Which is kind of a cool app
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:19,935	| IOT012 |	Location
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,727	| IOT012 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,543	| IOT012 |	Healthcare Providers on how to
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:28,127	| IOT012 |	Practically received information know what to expect and you can be better prepared
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,151	| IOT012 |	So exactly
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,175	| IOT012 |	And so
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,479	| IOT012 |	I think the end instead of just like
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:37,087	| IOT012 |	Like the patient's heart data and all their
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:39,391	| IOT012 |	Vital signs from the paramedics
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,463	| IOT012 |	This guy he was crushed by a car
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,767	| IOT012 |	So
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:45,791	| IOT012 |	I should be good
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:46,559	| IOT012 |	So that is that
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:50,143	| IOT012 |	Moving out of the industrial internet and back into the home
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,167	| IOT012 |	We have
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,447	| IOT012 |	Kevin years
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,471	| IOT012 |	Your thoughts on the
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,519	| IOT012 |	Homekit as the homeless hub
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,287	| IOT012 |	Publix sub
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,823	| IOT012 |	Homeless homeless
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,871	| IOT012 |	Nobody should be homeless
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:04,991	| IOT012 |	This was an interesting article over it that's not funny. Com
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:07,039	| IOT012 |	Apple's homekit and
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:09,087	| IOT012 |	Howard wheeler won't work with a hug
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:12,159	| IOT012 |	And Adam Bianca who wrote the article
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:14,719	| IOT012 |	Found something really interesting and he's been playing with
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,023	| IOT012 |	With some homekit devices the first
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,327	| IOT012 |	You have just launched in the past couple weeks
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:22,655	| IOT012 |	Co-create his Lutron caseta Hub and again I may be saying that
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,727	| IOT012 |	To the new homekit version
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,263	| IOT012 |	And then found out that
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:31,359	| IOT012 |	He can actually control it through the Elgato Eve app on his iPhone
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:38,015	| IOT012 |	So the EVAP which Eve we talked about in the past like those are the the sensors that you put in your house for a humidity temperature in such right
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,063	| IOT012 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,087	| IOT012 |	Right so
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,135	| IOT012 |	In the EVAP he could actually
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:43,903	| IOT012 |	Control
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,463	| IOT012 |	Through
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:52,351	| IOT012 |	So is interesting in that we talked about getaways Apple TV going to be a
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,631	| IOT012 |	Homekit hub
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:56,703	| IOT012 |	That all the devices work through we already know that
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:13:02,847	| IOT012 |	Apple TV will even though Apple did not announce us at WWDC it's on their support page for for homekit
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:03,871	| IOT012 |	Apple TV
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:06,687	| IOT012 |	Gateway for remote access
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:09,759	| IOT012 |	But in a sense it almost sounds like you don't need a hub
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:11,295	| IOT012 |	For the homekit devices to
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:14,367	| IOT012 |	Work together that was a key question I had
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:16,159	| IOT012 |	About how dissolving a horse
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,439	| IOT012 |	In Tampa because
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:20,767	| IOT012 |	I like things to do things based on what's Happening so if
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:25,119	| IOT012 |	One sensor see something maybe another device from another manufacturer might
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:27,679	| IOT012 |	Do something else and they looks like
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:30,495	| IOT012 |	There may be wasted at least control thing
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:32,287	| IOT012 |	So I thought I was quite interesting
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:34,847	| IOT012 |	He summed it up I'm going to read what he said
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,871	| IOT012 |	Because I think this really drives
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:40,735	| IOT012 |	Homekit is the ability to standardize the language spoken by all of your smart home things
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:44,063	| IOT012 |	So that these things can all interact with each other and
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:46,623	| IOT012 |	Can be controlled by multiple iOS devices
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:48,671	| IOT012 |	Without needing to be a central control
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:51,999	| IOT012 |	And they said it's finally a hubless smart home hub
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:56,095	| IOT012 |	It sounds to me this is very much the vision of
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:56,607	| IOT012 |	Join
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,239	| IOT012 |	Talk to each other
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:03,519	| IOT012 |	And communicate
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:05,055	| IOT012 |	Between devices
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:07,615	| IOT012 |	And using a set of standard
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,919	| IOT012 |	I guess it's schema
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,455	| IOT012 |	A standard way of saying
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,479	| IOT012 |	I am dis
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:14,015	| IOT012 |	I have the capability to do
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:14,783	| IOT012 |	The following sing
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,599	| IOT012 |	That's exactly what I'll do
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:20,415	| IOT012 |	It sounds also a lot like what Google
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,231	| IOT012 |	And
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:26,815	| IOT012 |	It's also what Intel has been pushing with iotivity
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:27,583	| IOT012 |	It's a lot like this
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:31,423	| IOT012 |	And isn't that interesting we started the show with how all the
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:34,495	| IOT012 |	Things are becoming the same depending on you regardless of manufacturer
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:35,519	| IOT012 |	Mrs.
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:36,543	| IOT012 |	Again
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:40,895	| IOT012 |	The same concept apply to Coyote and hunting snorkels now
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:42,431	| IOT012 |	Yes but these are not interrupt
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:45,247	| IOT012 |	Yet so catch there
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:50,367	| IOT012 |	I guess it's time for us to go to our 5 minutes
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:54,463	| IOT012 |	This is going to be probably a lot
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,231	| IOT012 |	More than 5 minutes
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,791	| IOT012 |	5 ish
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:59,327	| IOT012 |	You can stop at five
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:03,167	| IOT012 |	So what I'm talking about is the welcome camera
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,447	| IOT012 |	It was launched this week
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:08,799	| IOT012 |	Is the company that also makes the rain gauge system
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,335	| IOT012 |	Camera itself
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,615	| IOT012 |	Is brand new
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:13,919	| IOT012 |	It retails for $199
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:16,223	| IOT012 |	And the coolest thing about it
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:16,991	| IOT012 |	Other than its design
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,831	| IOT012 |	It's a very tiny Pringles can
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,111	| IOT012 |	It is this
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,391	| IOT012 |	It's the science
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:23,903	| IOT012 |	About the
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:25,183	| IOT012 |	It's smaller than a
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:27,487	| IOT012 |	Like a 16 oz water bottle
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:30,047	| IOT012 |	And it's even a little skinnier and it's
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:30,815	| IOT012 |	It's beautiful
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,631	| IOT012 |	Aluminum recycle paper towel roll
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,423	| IOT012 |	No it's
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:39,007	| IOT012 |	Is shorter than a paper towel roll but it's about that
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:41,823	| IOT012 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,871	| IOT012 |	It's a camera
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:44,383	| IOT012 |	It's pretty
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,175	| IOT012 |	And the coolest thing about it
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:48,991	| IOT012 |	Is that it offers facial recognition
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,015	| IOT012 |	So
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:53,599	| IOT012 |	When people walk in after you train it a little bit
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:57,439	| IOT012 |	I got it for day and a half and I'm Midway through training in it
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:58,975	| IOT012 |	Faces
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,743	| IOT012 |	Who is this person
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,535	| IOT012 |	And you say oh it's Stacey
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:03,583	| IOT012 |	Or in your case you like I was Kevin
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,399	| IOT012 |	And whenever it sees that person
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:09,983	| IOT012 |	It sends a notification to you in the cool thing is
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,519	| IOT012 |	The notification
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:14,079	| IOT012 |	It's no longer like I've detected movement
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,615	| IOT012 |	Which doesn't tell you anything it now says
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:16,639	| IOT012 |	Kevin's home
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:18,431	| IOT012 |	Kevin Zoe's home I don't get out much
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:22,015	| IOT012 |	In the kitchen
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:24,063	| IOT012 |	Can you connect me depending on where your camera is
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:25,599	| IOT012 |	He brings presents
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,879	| IOT012 |	So it's a way to bring
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,647	| IOT012 |	Presents
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,439	| IOT012 |	Minutes away to bring presents
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,463	| IOT012 |	What's even for people
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:34,047	| IOT012 |	Like my daughter who doesn't have a cell phone or Bluetooth devices on
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:37,375	| IOT012 |	I knew you were going to go there cuz I was just going to say
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,655	| IOT012 |	My phone can do that
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,959	| IOT012 |	T4 presents but you're right
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:42,239	| IOT012 |	Not everybody has one end
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:45,567	| IOT012 |	Yes I know I know
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:49,663	| IOT012 |	This is this isn't interested like bring presents into the home
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:52,991	| IOT012 |	People are going to be really excited about is
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,039	| IOT012 |	The camera can take video
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,599	| IOT012 |	And
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:58,879	| IOT012 |	Record of life
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,671	| IOT012 |	Motion-sensing
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:02,463	| IOT012 |	And pictures related to that
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:04,767	| IOT012 |	Are all stored on an SD card on the device
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,815	| IOT012 |	Sono cloud in golf
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:08,351	| IOT012 |	So there is a cloud
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:15,007	| IOT012 |	What did such a cloud is basically the timeline of events
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:15,775	| IOT012 |	Like so
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:17,311	| IOT012 |	Kevin has
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,847	| IOT012 |	NFL
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,615	| IOT012 |	Face basically so
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,407	| IOT012 |	Kevin has
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,175	| IOT012 |	Is entered the kitchen
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,711	| IOT012 |	Gets stuck
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:29,599	| IOT012 |	You can send your face to the cloud
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,647	| IOT012 |	And the videos that
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,415	| IOT012 |	Can generate
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:34,463	| IOT012 |	If you asked me to generate videos
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:37,279	| IOT012 |	Let's not go there we've already had one kerfuffle on the show
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:46,239	| IOT012 |	But that's the sphere is connected cameras in my home
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,031	| IOT012 |	Suddenly my home is now
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,567	| IOT012 |	Open to
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,847	| IOT012 |	Basically anyone who's like
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:52,639	| IOT012 |	Has the capability to
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,663	| IOT012 |	Hack into a server
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:55,199	| IOT012 |	In Amazon stock end
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:56,735	| IOT012 |	So here's a question
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:18:01,087	| IOT012 |	I'm not going to go not going to talk about the price 199 it is what it is
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:07,231	| IOT012 |	What can I do with that other than just being notified that I could I have certain things happen in the house
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:08,255	| IOT012 |	Trigger events
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:10,047	| IOT012 |	Because I walk in the door
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:10,559	| IOT012 |	With clothes on
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,143	| IOT012 |	Hopefully if you're coming in from outside you are wearing
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:17,983	| IOT012 |	Today
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:21,055	| IOT012 |	With all this other devices are supported
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,079	| IOT012 |	If this then that
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:26,175	| IOT012 |	This because it just launched his not but that is a priority
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:26,943	| IOT012 |	According to the CEO
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,247	| IOT012 |	Soon
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,295	| IOT012 |	You should be able to say when Stacy enters
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:33,343	| IOT012 |	Turn the Lights this way
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:38,719	| IOT012 |	And they will happen this way but when my husband enters a room where my daughter does
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,487	| IOT012 |	It would be
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:40,511	| IOT012 |	Turn the Lights this way
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:42,815	| IOT012 |	Kind of their first priority
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:43,839	| IOT012 |	We'll see how long it take
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:44,863	| IOT012 |	It shouldn't take too long
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:48,191	| IOT012 |	That will make it far more valuable to me
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:51,007	| IOT012 |	Yes yes I don't think I mean
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:53,567	| IOT012 |	It is always nice you can currently
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,871	| IOT012 |	Look into wherever the room is and see a live
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,407	| IOT012 |	It's delayed by a
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:18:59,967	| IOT012 |	4 second
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:01,759	| IOT012 |	Just enough to put your clothes on
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,623	| IOT012 |	Terrible
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,135	| IOT012 |	Sorry
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,671	| IOT012 |	So so that
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:10,719	| IOT012 |	Security
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:12,767	| IOT012 |	That's worthwhile to them
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:13,791	| IOT012 |	They can look in
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:16,095	| IOT012 |	They can also set it so people who aren't recognized
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:19,423	| IOT012 |	Tetrachords a video so if like some burglar breaks in
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:24,031	| IOT012 |	If there's definitely a security aspect in addition to presents I like that
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:25,823	| IOT012 |	Security
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:26,335	| IOT012 |	Presents
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:32,735	| IOT012 |	I wonder if the facial recognition works with animals cuz I used a webcam 3 years ago to figure out which the cat
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,503	| IOT012 |	Square
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,295	| IOT012 |	Relieving themselves on my Christmas tree
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,647	| IOT012 |	Facial recognition
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:41,951	| IOT012 |	You have to train it on
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:42,975	| IOT012 |	A set of
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:47,071	| IOT012 |	Faces so if you wanted to recognize animals you have to train it on a set of animals
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,631	| IOT012 |	I don't think they've done that
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:54,239	| IOT012 |	Probably a low priority for the company I get it
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,031	| IOT012 |	So I think that's it
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:58,591	| IOT012 |	Please stay tuned because our guest
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,383	| IOT012 |	This week is Dave Freeman

EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:53,119	| IOT012 |	Let's start out ala is a
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:54,399	| IOT012 |	It's a cloud provider
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,167	| IOT012 |	4
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,703	| IOT012 |	Companies who want to
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,727	| IOT012 |	Get products online
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:02,591	| IOT012 |	Yes that's correct we provide infrastructure
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:05,151	| IOT012 |	Manufacturers so that they don't have to
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:08,991	| IOT012 |	To try and do this on their own are our infrastructure includes a cloud platform
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:12,575	| IOT012 |	The manages the devices a device side software
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:16,159	| IOT012 |	That's running inside chips are gateways and application software
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:17,184	| IOT012 |	Awesome
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:24,096	| IOT012 |	And you are in China because you guys just announced that you are doing a deal where you're the kind of back in provider

EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:30,496	| IOT012 |	We definitely work very closely with WeChat
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,520	| IOT012 |	A lot of us
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:34,592	| IOT012 |	May not know what WeChat is in the United States but it's massive
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:38,944	| IOT012 |	Pretty much everyone uses it here as a social network so the idea is
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:39,712	| IOT012 |	Of course
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:41,504	| IOT012 |	We're all looking for the super app and
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:45,088	| IOT012 |	A tailor we can't believe these Giants social networks
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:46,112	| IOT012 |	Sunshine in the US
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:46,624	| IOT012 |	Swill
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,160	| IOT012 |	Have the best
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:48,928	| IOT012 |	Chance
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:50,208	| IOT012 |	Provide that super app
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:54,304	| IOT012 |	Yes sir we are making it easy for all the manufacturer
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,888	| IOT012 |	Awesome services
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,656	| IOT012 |	Got it
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,424	| IOT012 |	So
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:01,216	| IOT012 |	Walk me through an example
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:02,752	| IOT012 |	Because I think if wechat kind of like
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:04,800	| IOT012 |	WhatsApp Meats Twitter
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:06,336	| IOT012 |	So
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,616	| IOT012 |	How would a customer use the
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:13,760	| IOT012 |	Well you know it's interesting that are really mundane
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,784	| IOT012 |	And they're not that
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:16,576	| IOT012 |	On their own
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:19,392	| IOT012 |	And yet when they can interact with
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:22,976	| IOT012 |	The Social Network where you spend all your time I guess it makes them
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:23,744	| IOT012 |	More interesting
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:25,024	| IOT012 |	But but
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:27,328	| IOT012 |	Maybe more importantly if you make lights
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,608	| IOT012 |	Switches or something
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:29,888	| IOT012 |	You can sell
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:31,424	| IOT012 |	Your own light switch app
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:31,936	| IOT012 |	But
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,752	| IOT012 |	Better perhaps if it uses the
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:35,776	| IOT012 |	WeChat apps
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:39,104	| IOT012 |	Maybe control the light switch cuz you might use the same WeChat app
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:42,688	| IOT012 |	Lots of other things in your home I think it's the integration
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,736	| IOT012 |	And getting closer to the super app
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:47,040	| IOT012 |	Is the most exciting part of this
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:48,832	| IOT012 |	All right
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:51,136	| IOT012 |	When you keeps you keep using that word
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,928	| IOT012 |	I don't know what you mean
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:23:00,608	| IOT012 |	Well you know it's funny when you start a company like Ayla you you can look into the future little bit you say
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:07,264	| IOT012 |	Do I want a door lock thermostat light switch app a refrigerator in a garage door
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:10,336	| IOT012 |	And I think we know the answer to rhetorical question
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:10,848	| IOT012 |	And so
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,128	| IOT012 |	The super app
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:14,176	| IOT012 |	I guess for us is
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:15,712	| IOT012 |	Start of the my home app
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:19,808	| IOT012 |	And we think we chat in the social networks have the best opera
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:25,952	| IOT012 |	Community to provide the super app or the my home app my question for you is how I as a user
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:32,608	| IOT012 |	Turn on my lights using WeChat and then again how I as a user would do something like set of goodnight set
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,376	| IOT012 |	Using WeChat
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:34,912	| IOT012 |	Well
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:38,752	| IOT012 |	Technical answered that they enable the ability to have HTML5
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,032	| IOT012 |	Control apps
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,824	| IOT012 |	It's not just a noun
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:44,384	| IOT012 |	Speak into the app like a standard WeChat
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:46,688	| IOT012 |	So they've built out the infrastructure
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:52,320	| IOT012 |	So that you can actually control light bulb you can build a nap inside WeChat the controls light bulb
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:55,648	| IOT012 |	Okay what are the benefits of using a social network
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:56,928	| IOT012 |	As opposed to
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:00,256	| IOT012 |	Your own kind of home hub I can think of things like
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:01,024	| IOT012 |	When you travel
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:06,656	| IOT012 |	Swift like your hotel room or
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:09,216	| IOT012 |	It is that even possible or is that just crazy talk
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,824	| IOT012 |	You know it's a broad question
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:15,104	| IOT012 |	In the case of
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:17,152	| IOT012 |	Little Caesars Entertainment there's this
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:20,224	| IOT012 |	Vast social network that they might want to tap
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:22,272	| IOT012 |	More of these
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:26,112	| IOT012 |	Great Chinese consumers into their hotel rooms now
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:26,880	| IOT012 |	In your home
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:33,792	| IOT012 |	Again it just makes it easier than the Chinese internet companies do so much more than say create a chat app
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,072	| IOT012 |	They do payments you can
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:35,840	| IOT012 |	You can help tax
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:40,192	| IOT012 |	I have an Uber like capability inside China to so they
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:42,240	| IOT012 |	Built the infrastructure so again if you
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:44,032	| IOT012 |	Have your device
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:45,056	| IOT012 |	Connected to WeChat there
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:48,640	| IOT012 |	Services that does payment and end all sorts of different things
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:49,664	| IOT012 |	Got it so
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:53,248	| IOT012 |	They have all of this information I just tell it what I wanted to do
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:57,088	| IOT012 |	I'm working within the app so I don't have to open my new app
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:00,928	| IOT012 |	That's correct
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,720	| IOT012 |	Got it okay
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:03,488	| IOT012 |	That does sound sleeper
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:09,888	| IOT012 |	So let's let's talk a little bit about where China is with adopting the internet
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,168	| IOT012 |	Speakers
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,960	| IOT012 |	You guys have been there for
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:14,496	| IOT012 |	Years guess maybe
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,776	| IOT012 |	Movie years is too long
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:19,616	| IOT012 |	It is all sort of gradually growing invest
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:21,152	| IOT012 |	Smith that's not so gradual
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:25,248	| IOT012 |	Yes funny I had a big dinner with our team we had a
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:28,064	| IOT012 |	The official opening we've probably been at it
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:31,648	| IOT012 |	For two years here of our officer was last year about this time and so
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:34,464	| IOT012 |	We went last year when we open that office
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:36,512	| IOT012 |	There were fewer people globally at ala
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:38,560	| IOT012 |	Then there are now in
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:41,120	| IOT012 |	China so I think there's about 30 people in China
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,400	| IOT012 |	Enchanted
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:44,192	| IOT012 |	What's happening right now is
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:49,568	| IOT012 |	I think it's like the United States only touch behind his ally awesome Kickstarter company launching products
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:52,896	| IOT012 |	And there's the big companies are starting to
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:54,432	| IOT012 |	The build and design their products
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:57,760	| IOT012 |	You're not seeing a huge amount of these
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:58,784	| IOT012 |	Things on the shelves
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:02,624	| IOT012 |	We'll see a lot more 2016 really 2017
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,648	| IOT012 |	Toby
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:08,768	| IOT012 |	The same of the US only the us maybe you know we'll see holiday 2016 Dobby
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:10,304	| IOT012 |	A good amount just a lot of
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,328	| IOT012 |	Design activity happening
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,120	| IOT012 |	Okay
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:14,656	| IOT012 |	And do these devices like
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:18,240	| IOT012 |	Right now I feel like we're the stage of buying one off devices
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:24,896	| IOT012 |	And I'm looking forward to when we get to the stage where we kind of start just building connectivity into things
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:26,688	| IOT012 |	Because it's cheap because it makes sense
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:34,112	| IOT012 |	Yeah you know I think you're right though but so what's happening is there's a product manager at these companies whose lawn
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,904	| IOT012 |	Launching a product it's not yet certain
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:38,208	| IOT012 |	Corporate at the sea level
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:44,096	| IOT012 |	A bunch of ayla's customers an hour or big Appliance companies and they have a whole plan of launching
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:44,864	| IOT012 |	Sexy
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:46,400	| IOT012 |	Devices that they don't just
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:49,728	| IOT012 |	Do you know they might say kitchen appliances in MA
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:51,520	| IOT012 |	I'll let you know the clothing type stuff
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,824	| IOT012 |	But it is right it's one off
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,104	| IOT012 |	So you know what they're great products
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:27:00,480	| IOT012 |	But everyone's starting with her toe in the water I think that's why like I said you're not going to have
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:01,760	| IOT012 |	Huge amount
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,552	| IOT012 |	Holiday 2015
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:08,160	| IOT012 |	You'll have a bunch more 2016 and you'll start to see the integration of all these things
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:09,184	| IOT012 |	2017
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:10,464	| IOT012 |	And a lot more volume
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,232	| IOT012 |	Now
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:15,072	| IOT012 |	Stacy the other big deal though it's funny when we started the company 2010
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:18,656	| IOT012 |	The cost to add the networking like the hardware part ala dozen
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:20,960	| IOT012 |	We don't do Hardware but
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:24,544	| IOT012 |	It was probably about 70% higher than it is today
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:26,080	| IOT012 |	And same with info
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:28,128	| IOT012 |	You know it's amazing so
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:29,152	| IOT012 |	Amazon services
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:32,480	| IOT012 |	Is we run globally on AWS inside China 2
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:33,248	| IOT012 |	Aldo's
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,784	| IOT012 |	Also drop by about 7
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,552	| IOT012 |	80%
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:38,368	| IOT012 |	This is you know your set your question is will when will I see and everything
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:39,648	| IOT012 |	You're about to
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:42,464	| IOT012 |	Do because everyone is singing at the prices are now they say
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:44,512	| IOT012 |	Should I can put this in in the cost
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:45,536	| IOT012 |	The added
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:47,328	| IOT012 |	To my thing almost whatever it is
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:50,400	| IOT012 |	Is outweigh even by the ability to Serta
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:52,960	| IOT012 |	Understand warranty and service and maintenance
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:55,264	| IOT012 |	Let alone turn the cool features for consumers
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:57,824	| IOT012 |	Awesome so how much does the hardware
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:27:59,616	| IOT012 |	It is
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:02,432	| IOT012 |	Well below $5 now
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:04,736	| IOT012 |	You mentioned the cloud cost and I have to ask
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:05,504	| IOT012 |	Because
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:08,320	| IOT012 |	One of the things I'm really curious about is
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:10,368	| IOT012 |	How long you might want to support
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:12,672	| IOT012 |	The washing machine or something that's
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:14,976	| IOT012 |	It feels a little low value in terms of
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:17,024	| IOT012 |	Opportunity
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:19,840	| IOT012 |	And it's important that for like 15 years on a cloud
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:20,864	| IOT012 |	Does that make
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,888	| IOT012 |	Economic sense
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:23,168	| IOT012 |	You know it.
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:25,472	| IOT012 |	We don't necessarily do it if it
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:29,056	| IOT012 |	If it doesn't make sense and I don't think the manufacturer would either frankly now
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:31,616	| IOT012 |	You know what's interesting so today a lot of the product
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:33,408	| IOT012 |	That we work with
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:36,224	| IOT012 |	Are connected either by zigbee connect
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:37,504	| IOT012 |	One of the gateways
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:38,528	| IOT012 |	Or Wi-Fi
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:45,696	| IOT012 |	Now so you're at that that's a hardware thing that we just talked about but eventually because now you have
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:48,000	| IOT012 |	NFC that's going to be opened up an iPhone as well
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:53,376	| IOT012 |	You know you're at your washing machine might just have an NFC thing for you
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:55,680	| IOT012 |	You know you to be able to help troubleshoot
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:57,984	| IOT012 |	And hit a button and send it up
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:59,520	| IOT012 |	I understand what's going on with the product
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:04,640	| IOT012 |	But you know what's interesting is connected let's just use at a clothes washer
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:07,200	| IOT012 |	It doesn't have to talk to the service very often
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:10,528	| IOT012 |	It might talk to the service once a day
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:13,344	| IOT012 |	The ability for a thing like
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:16,160	| IOT012 |	The clothes washer to talk to a service once a day
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:16,928	| IOT012 |	It is
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:18,208	| IOT012 |	Incredibly efficient
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:20,512	| IOT012 |	To be able to do that doesn't cost a lot
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:22,048	| IOT012 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:23,584	| IOT012 |	I agree now I would say
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:26,400	| IOT012 |	I think Bender should probably just stay
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:28,192	| IOT012 |	Wi-Fi or some kind of
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:29,728	| IOT012 |	Constant connectivity in there
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:32,288	| IOT012 |	Because I've never met someone
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:34,592	| IOT012 |	Who gets data from the internet
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,128	| IOT012 |	It says
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:36,896	| IOT012 |	Wow
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:37,920	| IOT012 |	This is great
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,200	| IOT012 |	And once a day is enough
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,992	| IOT012 |	I feel like what will happen
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,808	| IOT012 |	Is the people that every time I won
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:45,856	| IOT012 |	Run my washer is there going to be like
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:48,672	| IOT012 |	Hey actually we want to know every time she runs it
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:52,256	| IOT012 |	We want to know what's in there if possible and how it's running
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:53,536	| IOT012 |	And suddenly
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:55,584	| IOT012 |	What happens is
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:57,888	| IOT012 |	It's being connected more and more often
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:29:59,680	| IOT012 |	That's kind of how they
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:00,704	| IOT012 |	Internet works right
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:02,496	| IOT012 |	You know I think there is
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:04,288	| IOT012 |	There's not one-size-fits-all
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:06,336	| IOT012 |	The cost reduction that's half
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:12,480	| IOT012 |	Really it's a trade-off right it's the user going up to the thing and touching it with a phone and getting the data
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:14,016	| IOT012 |	Versus
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:15,808	| IOT012 |	It's slightly if you know the Edition
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:17,600	| IOT012 |	Cost of adding Wi-Fi it's really that simple
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:21,952	| IOT012 |	I think the cost of that is going down to wear lots of manufacturers
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:23,488	| IOT012 |	Would like to have that concert
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,256	| IOT012 |	The connection is true
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:30,912	| IOT012 |	How are your customers thinking about building these products are they trying to build in basically connectivity for
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,680	| IOT012 |	Coolest sake
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:33,984	| IOT012 |	Are they really trying to create
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,520	| IOT012 |	A new service
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:41,664	| IOT012 |	We have what we would call 1.0 company so what and what we mean by that is
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:43,712	| IOT012 |	Some customers want to have at least
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:44,992	| IOT012 |	Feature parity
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:46,784	| IOT012 |	With maybe a new entrance
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:47,296	| IOT012 |	The market
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:50,368	| IOT012 |	And when I want to say one. Do it just means
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:53,184	| IOT012 |	I want to also be competitive I I want to give
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:56,256	| IOT012 |	Similar capabilities that
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:57,024	| IOT012 |	Someone else has
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:59,072	| IOT012 |	One of our early customers
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:01,120	| IOT012 |	Is Johnson Controls a build a great
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:02,144	| IOT012 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:07,776	| IOT012 |	Using Amos technology where the underlying platform for that and Nest was in the market now this allowed them to
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:10,592	| IOT012 |	Get something on the market Havasu without hiring a whole cloud
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:11,360	| IOT012 |	Semenax semen everything
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:16,736	| IOT012 |	But some companies are thinking about the data much earlier and probably faster than we thought
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:19,296	| IOT012 |	Some companies realize
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,576	| IOT012 |	State if they understand
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,856	| IOT012 |	What's going on with the products
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:22,624	| IOT012 |	They can earn
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,416	| IOT012 |	More services
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:25,184	| IOT012 |	Or they can
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:25,952	| IOT012 |	Provide
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:27,744	| IOT012 |	Actually service and maintenance
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:28,256	| IOT012 |	Mortician
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,304	| IOT012 |	God is a bit of a mix
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:31,584	| IOT012 |	No that makes sense
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:33,888	| IOT012 |	And let's take it back to China since
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:34,912	| IOT012 |	That's where you are
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:37,984	| IOT012 |	Pictures this week with WeChat
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:39,008	| IOT012 |	Was
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:40,544	| IOT012 |	Consumer-oriented
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:41,568	| IOT012 |	But
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:44,896	| IOT012 |	Are you working with Chinese manufacturers or how is it
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:46,432	| IOT012 |	How is kind of Batman
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:47,456	| IOT012 |	Evolving
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:50,016	| IOT012 |	Yeah it's kind of only for manufacturer
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,296	| IOT012 |	There's really a so
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:57,440	| IOT012 |	Century one of the companies we work with his ozner it's a makes perfect sense they provide
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:31:59,232	| IOT012 |	Water filtration
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:04,352	| IOT012 |	Filters and they kind of do kind of the o2o type thing
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:06,912	| IOT012 |	You're the online-offline where they
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:09,472	| IOT012 |	They get people to your building or your home
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:10,496	| IOT012 |	And replace
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,520	| IOT012 |	The filters
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:18,432	| IOT012 |	David Kennedy getting these things connected so that desire need for them bad connectivity no the WeChat
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:20,736	| IOT012 |	And consumers are major Target makes it just
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,784	| IOT012 |	More cool more approachable
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:24,576	| IOT012 |	No not like some
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:26,624	| IOT012 |	Weird thing you have in the background by
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:30,208	| IOT012 |	People in China spend a lot of time on WeChat and this
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:30,976	| IOT012 |	Just makes
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:33,536	| IOT012 |	Maybe something of mundane
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,560	| IOT012 |	Perhaps like a filter
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:36,096	| IOT012 |	Just a little cooler
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:38,656	| IOT012 |	I see I can't wait for a cooler filters
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,936	| IOT012 |	With
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:42,496	| IOT012 |	With the Chinese market as a US company
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:47,104	| IOT012 |	What was your process in getting over there and what are the advantages and
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:48,640	| IOT012 |	Let's talk a little bit about that
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:53,504	| IOT012 |	One of the processes for being here was have a co-founder
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:56,320	| IOT012 |	Who has amazing relationships
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:57,088	| IOT012 |	In China
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,368	| IOT012 |	And by the way without that
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:01,184	| IOT012 |	Your China is all about relationship
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:01,952	| IOT012 |	Entrust first
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:05,536	| IOT012 |	And then you have to have great technology and Emmett and a business
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,304	| IOT012 |	This model that works
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:09,632	| IOT012 |	But Philip who I've worked with Forever Phil Chang
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:11,424	| IOT012 |	We he and I worked
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:15,520	| IOT012 |	Together in China at our last company and someone we started this company
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:17,312	| IOT012 |	We said hey let's give to go
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:19,104	| IOT012 |	Let's see if we can leverage these relation
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:24,992	| IOT012 |	And and do something interesting when we started by the way we chat was almost nothing at that
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:26,272	| IOT012 |	Know if WeChat had
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:30,368	| IOT012 |	Any users we start in 2010 our first customer in China was Cena
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:33,184	| IOT012 |	WeChat was smaller than Sina weibo back
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:35,232	| IOT012 |	It's much different right now
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:36,768	| IOT012 |	That's true
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,584	| IOT012 |	Things move fast
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:41,120	| IOT012 |	They do they do
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:43,424	| IOT012 |	As it is a back in provider
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:44,448	| IOT012 |	Asbys
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:48,032	| IOT012 |	As he's kind of abs inflows and popularity of service
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,312	| IOT012 |	Services happen
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,848	| IOT012 |	Do you see adding
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:56,480	| IOT012 |	Adding connectivity to your home being something that will help retain users and keep
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:59,808	| IOT012 |	Keep them from moving or is that just kind of an offering that
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:03,392	| IOT012 |	Can skip from place to place cuz now it's basically in the cloud
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:05,440	| IOT012 |	So
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:09,536	| IOT012 |	Fickleness I suppose of the consumer is less of an issue for a lice
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,072	| IOT012 |	We're just
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:12,096	| IOT012 |	The underlying
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:15,168	| IOT012 |	Infrastructure that it is using
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:18,240	| IOT012 |	So that they can build a set of connected pricing
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,008	| IOT012 |	Connect to
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:22,592	| IOT012 |	B2c applications are maybe the most popular at the time
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:25,408	| IOT012 |	Right now I'm thinking about for your customer base
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:28,224	| IOT012 |	Okay for so4 the a Lacoste
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:29,248	| IOT012 |	Base meaning manufacturer
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:31,040	| IOT012 |	Manufacturers
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:32,576	| IOT012 |	WeChat guys
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:34,880	| IOT012 |	Yes how easy is it
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:37,952	| IOT012 |	The consumer tied in
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:38,464	| IOT012 |	Pinterest
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:40,000	| IOT012 |	Once you've built it
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:41,280	| IOT012 |	It service
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:44,352	| IOT012 |	I think I guess if you're using data you can follow
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:45,376	| IOT012 |	I mean without
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:51,776	| IOT012 |	The data then you're it's very difficult but the biggest with or without ala by the way the giant internet plan
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:58,176	| IOT012 |	They understand consumers they understand your eyeballs and what you do all the time Amazon is amazing
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:34:58,944	| IOT012 |	At this
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:00,224	| IOT012 |	Your browser tells
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:01,248	| IOT012 |	Them everything about you
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:04,832	| IOT012 |	And so I think that's why these companies are
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:08,672	| IOT012 |	Beating against maybe the Old Guard they are great retailer because they understand the
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:09,440	| IOT012 |	Data
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:14,048	| IOT012 |	WeChat certainly understands how people use their services as well and now
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:16,096	| IOT012 |	Honestly we just see the internet is
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:16,864	| IOT012 |	Evolving
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:18,656	| IOT012 |	From PC to mobile two things
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:19,936	| IOT012 |	So you're getting a 1/2
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:23,776	| IOT012 |	You punch your customers are reducing their shirt and consumer users
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:26,080	| IOT012 |	Also getting access to this amazing
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:28,128	| IOT012 |	Set of data that they can then use to
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:30,176	| IOT012 |	Presumably improve their services
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:37,600	| IOT012 |	Yeah that that's right I need a WeChat these are giant, Adela is just to be clear not the only way
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:39,136	| IOT012 |	That they interact with internet
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:41,952	| IOT012 |	The things they have amazing Engineers we work with
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:44,768	| IOT012 |	They also connect directly to manufacturers
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:47,328	| IOT012 |	But we do provide also pasta
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:51,168	| IOT012 |	How to get a lot of Manufacturers onto their services very quickly and efficiently
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:52,960	| IOT012 |	And yes then
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:55,264	| IOT012 |	By doing that they
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:58,592	| IOT012 |	And I think where they will be much better than even a company like ala
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:02,688	| IOT012 |	Come is a WeChat can really understand what consumers want
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:03,968	| IOT012 |	They can aggregate
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:05,760	| IOT012 |	What consumers are doing with all these
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:06,784	| IOT012 |	Different devices
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:09,088	| IOT012 |	And provide a better and better experience
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:12,160	| IOT012 |	So you're manufacturing customers
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:12,928	| IOT012 |	Are they can
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:15,744	| IOT012 |	Concerned about that because they're going to get data from their what
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:16,256	| IOT012 |	Appliances
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:17,280	| IOT012 |	Where is
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:18,560	| IOT012 |	Someone like
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:20,096	| IOT012 |	WeChat
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:21,376	| IOT012 |	Can see the whole
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,656	| IOT012 |	What's the date at which
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:23,680	| IOT012 |	Presumably has more value
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:26,496	| IOT012 |	And what kind of dynamic does that set up
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:27,520	| IOT012 |	You know I
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:32,384	| IOT012 |	I think it's a good question that they manufacture at least in the case where a Le is there in
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:33,408	| IOT012 |	Infrastructure they get
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:34,432	| IOT012 |	Decide
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:35,968	| IOT012 |	Which data goes up to WeChat
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:38,528	| IOT012 |	So we have something called role-based access
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:40,064	| IOT012 |	Controlled the manufacturer
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:40,832	| IOT012 |	Who gets to decide
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,112	| IOT012 |	By the data point
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:44,928	| IOT012 |	I mean by all that you know that they can have a
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:50,048	| IOT012 |	An air conditioner gives 50 different date appointments and they can send 11 of them up
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:52,608	| IOT012 |	WeChat but they don't have the capability the realities
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:54,656	| IOT012 |	If you make air conditioners and that's what you do
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:56,192	| IOT012 |	Then you
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:57,728	| IOT012 |	Are not going to have data
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:58,496	| IOT012 |	From
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:36:59,520	| IOT012 |	Kitchen appliances
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,056	| IOT012 |	Got it
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:01,824	| IOT012 |	Okay
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:03,360	| IOT012 |	Anything else about
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:04,128	| IOT012 |	China
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:04,896	| IOT012 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:08,992	| IOT012 |	Ala what we believe in what you see is obviously
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:10,528	| IOT012 |	The population here is massive
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:13,344	| IOT012 |	The amount of mobile
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:15,392	| IOT012 |	Users is also massive
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:18,720	| IOT012 |	China seems to be
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:22,048	| IOT012 |	We thank in north then say North America in terms of
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:25,376	| IOT012 |	Since it's such a highly mobile population here
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:27,424	| IOT012 |	Creating services
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:31,264	| IOT012 |	Tailored for mobile is
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:32,800	| IOT012 |	Be something they're very good at here
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:34,080	| IOT012 |	That is
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:37,920	| IOT012 |	One reason we spent a lot of time here the other reason is our services for me any facts
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:40,736	| IOT012 |	And you know a lot of manufacturers
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:41,504	| IOT012 |	Weather in China
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:44,064	| IOT012 |	Whether they ship inside China or globally
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:45,856	| IOT012 |	It's a good place for us to be
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:47,648	| IOT012 |	Awesome yes
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:49,440	| IOT012 |	Lots of companies would like to
