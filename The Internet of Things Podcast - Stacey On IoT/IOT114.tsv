EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:43,264	| IOT114 |	And some other cool things about
EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:45,568	| IOT114 |	So
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:47,616	| IOT114 |	Let's get this party started with
EDL	00:00:48,640	00:00:55,040	| IOT114 |	Quit message from one of our sponsors this week sponsor is Affiliated monitoring if you are hunting for a subscription
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:01:01,440	| IOT114 |	Revenue model for your iot business you need to hear about Affiliated monitoring in response to a trigger from any connected
EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:07,840	| IOT114 |	Is a vice Affiliated the professionally trained live agents can follow-up protocol and reach out to your customers their loved one

EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:19,616	| IOT114 |	Health and other iot businesses visit Affiliated. Com iot to read a case
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:26,016	| IOT114 |	A study on how they've helped connected car startup turn an idea into a thriving business with a hundred million dollar
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:28,576	| IOT114 |	Surrexit that's Affiliated. Com
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:30,368	| IOT114 |	/ iot
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:33,696	| IOT114 |	That's actually a really good idea
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:36,512	| IOT114 |	There's a lot of businesses that
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:38,048	| IOT114 |	Benefit from having a trigger
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:40,352	| IOT114 |	Actually do more than just send you a notification
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:42,144	| IOT114 |	All right
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:43,680	| IOT114 |	Unto the show
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:45,216	| IOT114 |	Let's go
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:46,496	| IOT114 |	Start with Andy Rubin
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:49,568	| IOT114 |	And the essential
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:53,408	| IOT114 |	We can't we have to talk about the essential phone and the essential home
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:54,944	| IOT114 |	One punch
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:56,736	| IOT114 |	Is only here the essential phone
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:57,504	| IOT114 |	So
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,784	| IOT114 |	Kevin do you think this is essential
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:04,416	| IOT114 |	Well they would like it to be like for those who don't know Andy Rubin is the
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:06,208	| IOT114 |	Creator of Android
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:09,280	| IOT114 |	And has left Google a couple years back and forget when
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,560	| IOT114 |	But this is his first
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,608	| IOT114 |	Venture outside of
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:14,912	| IOT114 |	Life after Google it isn't Android
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,448	| IOT114 |	Powered phone and it's
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,984	| IOT114 |	Iron specifications
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:19,264	| IOT114 |	And dealt with
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:22,080	| IOT114 |	Printed materials such as titanium and ceramic
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:25,408	| IOT114 |	Pretty much an edge-to-edge display even more so than the
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:26,432	| IOT114 |	Galaxy S
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:32,064	| IOT114 |	8 but Samsung makes I don't know if they see if you've seen the because it's edge to edge
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,600	| IOT114 |	Here's why this phone is not
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:34,880	| IOT114 |	Essential for me
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:38,720	| IOT114 |	I do not like the front facing camera cutout
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:39,744	| IOT114 |	On the display
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,048	| IOT114 |	Did you see that
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,072	| IOT114 |	I did
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:51,520	| IOT114 |	That separate that separate the top of the phone just like you would have
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:55,616	| IOT114 |	But since the screen goes all the way to the top Edge
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:59,968	| IOT114 |	It's almost like there's a hole there in the screen as you're looking at content
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,480	| IOT114 |	Oh I do see it
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:04,576	| IOT114 |	Looks like a keyhole or something like what is bad
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:09,952	| IOT114 |	Took to not essential for me personally I sent you would be to not see that
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:13,536	| IOT114 |	But regardless regardless of that it is all high-end
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,840	| IOT114 |	Specs on a Snapdragon 835 and
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:19,680	| IOT114 |	4 gig of RAM and all the typical high-end features
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:22,496	| IOT114 |	You were leading to the backside of the phone
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,520	| IOT114 |	Has these
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:25,056	| IOT114 |	To Pogo pins
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:30,176	| IOT114 |	Where you place a 360-degree camera you would it attaches to the phone
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:32,224	| IOT114 |	And then I believe it actually
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:37,600	| IOT114 |	Since the data from that 360 camera over a 60 gigahertz Wi-Fi gig
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:39,136	| IOT114 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,720	| IOT114 |	A new devices
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,512	| IOT114 |	Found it
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,048	| IOT114 |	Possibly
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,352	| IOT114 |	Maybe bring this technology
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:49,888	| IOT114 |	Like 2002
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:53,216	| IOT114 |	Ultra wideband
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:56,032	| IOT114 |	Ultra wideband that it was something else
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:59,360	| IOT114 |	So many chip companies went into this and fail
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:00,384	| IOT114 |	And
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:07,296	| IOT114 |	The standard is always been there basically Superfast High data rates you can send over 60 gigahertz but you can only do it when it's
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,576	| IOT114 |	It's really close proximity
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:15,488	| IOT114 |	Yep I totally totally it's a perfect season I knew because I knew you would cover the since way back
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,791	| IOT114 |	I knew you would love that little aspect of it
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:21,375	| IOT114 |	As we said it runs Android it's $699
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:30,847	| IOT114 |	360 camera
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:35,199	| IOT114 |	I would imagine not a lot of bloatware I'm suspecting US Stock Android or slightly tweet
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,527	| IOT114 |	Yoga wear
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,319	| IOT114 |	Very no logos
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:43,135	| IOT114 |	Yeah yeah minutes it's a nice-looking device
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:44,927	| IOT114 |	Now
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:52,607	| IOT114 |	Competes against a lot of other night so I can give Isis and this is a relatively unknown company because it's
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,143	| IOT114 |	Essentialism
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,191	| IOT114 |	Ribbon startup
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:56,703	| IOT114 |	So
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:02,335	| IOT114 |	We'll have to see it does it doesn't work well with security updates and so on and you know there's a lot of question
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:03,359	| IOT114 |	To be asked
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,407	| IOT114 |	We are not it
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,967	| IOT114 |	I thought you were going to leave the fact that we are not iPhone
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:09,759	| IOT114 |	We are
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,039	| IOT114 |	Iot
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,855	| IOT114 |	An iot compono
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:18,207	| IOT114 |	And it's very vague and fluffy so we're going to go with what we know
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:18,975	| IOT114 |	Which is
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,143	| IOT114 |	This summer
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:29,983	| IOT114 |	This is they call it home it runs something called ambient OS
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:34,079	| IOT114 |	And this is my idea is this will work
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:34,847	| IOT114 |	With everything
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,943	| IOT114 |	The product itself is a tiny round
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:42,271	| IOT114 |	Device looks kind of hockey puck Asia Terrace light
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:47,391	| IOT114 |	It reminds me of
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,927	| IOT114 |	An echo Dot
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:54,559	| IOT114 |	More wedge-shaped because the top is slanted is you had said and it has a touch screen display
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:57,631	| IOT114 |	Emma's wish that's what the. Was from Harbor perspective
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,191	| IOT114 |	Touch lamp
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:02,495	| IOT114 |	True true
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:06,847	| IOT114 |	And we don't know how much this is going to cost is coming out summer times
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,359	| IOT114 |	What's the time
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:14,783	| IOT114 |	So how does it work with everything that it works with homekit
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:15,807	| IOT114 |	Products that are very handy
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:22,975	| IOT114 |	It's apparently doing so that reverse engineering public apis which
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:24,767	| IOT114 |	Not ideal
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:28,607	| IOT114 |	I mean it's nice for like
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:31,935	| IOT114 |	But what happens if those public apis can change in
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:33,215	| IOT114 |	What will happen is it a break
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,519	| IOT114 |	Your product before
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,799	| IOT114 |	Fake necessarily fix it
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,079	| IOT114 |	Right
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,359	| IOT114 |	Sony demonstration
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,383	| IOT114 |	It's always better from
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:40,895	| IOT114 |	The end-user
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:44,991	| IOT114 |	It's Andy Rubin I can't imagine that these guys can't get
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:47,039	| IOT114 |	You know when the time comes
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:47,551	| IOT114 |	Cam specs
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:50,879	| IOT114 |	Since everyone else isn't that competes with like
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:53,183	| IOT114 |	Google maybe they won't do a nest integration
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,231	| IOT114 |	Play hard to say
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:59,583	| IOT114 |	One of the other aspects which is very important for our listeners is that
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,119	| IOT114 |	There's a privacy
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:08,031	| IOT114 |	Function I guess you could say or design in that it tries to handle as much data as possible locally on the device
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:10,335	| IOT114 |	I'm not sure how that's going to work
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:12,127	| IOT114 |	Because if it's tying into all these other
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,175	| IOT114 |	Platforms
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,991	| IOT114 |	It's going to be sending and receiving data in
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:20,575	| IOT114 |	I possibly giving giving data to those platforms so
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:21,599	| IOT114 |	I'm not sure
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,391	| IOT114 |	Not sure how that's going to work
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,183	| IOT114 |	It sounds good on paper but let's see
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:26,975	| IOT114 |	And
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:28,511	| IOT114 |	Just for funsies
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:30,559	| IOT114 |	I'm interested in this because
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,631	| IOT114 |	Playground pictures
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:35,423	| IOT114 |	Which is also backing this
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:39,775	| IOT114 |	They funded something called lighthouse
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:42,591	| IOT114 |	And lighthouses
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:46,175	| IOT114 |	A smart home assistant that has an image
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:50,015	| IOT114 |	Comment so computer vision components so it can actually see things so you can Chester to it
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:52,575	| IOT114 |	It sounds really cool this is also not a
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,391	| IOT114 |	Cool products
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:57,695	| IOT114 |	Bill's pretty competitive
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,463	| IOT114 |	With
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:58,975	| IOT114 |	What is this
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:03,071	| IOT114 |	I don't see a camera or mention of a camera on the
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,351	| IOT114 |	This device so
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,911	| IOT114 |	Anticipating no Machine Vision
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,471	| IOT114 |	Aspect to it which eventually help
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:10,239	| IOT114 |	Its first integration
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:14,079	| IOT114 |	But that'll help keep the cost down number one
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:16,383	| IOT114 |	And to it kind of leads back to the hole
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,943	| IOT114 |	New Amazon products which
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,735	| IOT114 |	I'm still scratching my head over I know you ordered
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:23,807	| IOT114 |	The show
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,879	| IOT114 |	And I seen the discount packs
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,391	| IOT114 |	Before
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:30,207	| IOT114 |	I had ordered my first one I would have
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:36,863	| IOT114 |	Cuz we need it cuz we need another way to talk
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:41,727	| IOT114 |	That's essential will find out more
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,751	| IOT114 |	We'll stay on this
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:44,543	| IOT114 |	Cuz by dali
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,871	| IOT114 |	You know I love Andy Rubin he's a big
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,639	| IOT114 |	Open
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:51,199	| IOT114 |	Kind of open web Guy Fieri consumeristic
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:55,039	| IOT114 |	I feel like his attention to the phone with some things of kind of
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:58,111	| IOT114 |	Tragedy fetishistic which I don't think is going to work
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:59,647	| IOT114 |	Actually in the smart home space
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:00,671	| IOT114 |	Because
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:05,279	| IOT114 |	Most normal people do not care if their stuff is made of titanium
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,839	| IOT114 |	And that's that's for the phone
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:09,631	| IOT114 |	I do have some concerns there
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:13,215	| IOT114 |	Also the fact that it's going to be doing everything local means it's got to be
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:14,751	| IOT114 |	Pretty robust
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,519	| IOT114 |	Processor on it
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,567	| IOT114 |	When should you add to the cost
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,359	| IOT114 |	10 tube
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:19,871	| IOT114 |	Be cheap
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,175	| IOT114 |	Again
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:22,943	| IOT114 |	We'll see
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:24,223	| IOT114 |	I would love for there to be more
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:25,247	| IOT114 |	Competition in the space
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:25,759	| IOT114 |	Jason actually
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:28,575	| IOT114 |	This was something I was thinking about talking about
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,855	| IOT114 |	Before this came out
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:33,439	| IOT114 |	I actually feel that my smart home works really well right
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:36,511	| IOT114 |	Weird
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:42,655	| IOT114 |	Because I spent so much time complaining about standards but when's the last time you guys heard me complain about like zigbee or Z-Wave
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,423	| IOT114 |	If I happen
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:48,287	| IOT114 |	Right or something or something that doesn't work with something because of some other particle maybe not
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,567	| IOT114 |	Messerli radio but
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:52,639	| IOT114 |	Maybe apis sdks
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,919	| IOT114 |	We're getting there
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:10:00,319	| IOT114 |	Yeah cuz with the Google will actually with the Amazon Echo and now with Google's latest Integrations I feel
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:02,367	| IOT114 |	Basically I just say what I want
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:07,231	| IOT114 |	And then there's also those super powerful tools like stringify and if now that it's
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:07,743	| IOT114 |	Scott the maker
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,303	| IOT114 |	I actually can do a lot
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,863	| IOT114 |	So this brings us to
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:23,615	| IOT114 |	Such a subtle Segway but oh so timely yes okay so
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,151	| IOT114 |	After
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:25,919	| IOT114 |	Almost there
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:32,319	| IOT114 |	Here I guess I guess Google announced the Google home be at last IO 2016
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:32,831	| IOT114 |	It wasn't available
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:37,695	| IOT114 |	That's true so I get a pass at least until October so
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:40,255	| IOT114 |	Longtime listeners will know I
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:43,583	| IOT114 |	Cast on the Google home because I have for Echo devices in my house
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:47,679	| IOT114 |	Mainly for the reasons that you just said because things worked
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:51,263	| IOT114 |	Write everything I needed to do eisworth well with the echo
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,543	| IOT114 |	However
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,335	| IOT114 |	I finally caved
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:56,639	| IOT114 |	I ordered a Google home for two reasons
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:11:02,015	| IOT114 |	It actually has not arrived at its comes tomorrow so I can't speak to how else working for me
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:05,855	| IOT114 |	But one of the reasons was all of the new Integrations
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,415	| IOT114 |	With the Smart Home Products the ones that I particularly use already
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:11,487	| IOT114 |	So it will essentially replace
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,255	| IOT114 |	An echo
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,559	| IOT114 |	Turn my smart home purposes
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:19,423	| IOT114 |	Additionally I do feel having use Google Assistant that when I want information
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:24,543	| IOT114 |	I get a broader range in more detail information more specific information from
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,567	| IOT114 |	Google
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:30,943	| IOT114 |	Knowledge Graph as opposed to the echo I think Amazon's made improvements but they have a ways to go there
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,223	| IOT114 |	So
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,759	| IOT114 |	The second reason I got it
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,807	| IOT114 |	3 reasons
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:37,343	| IOT114 |	The second reason I got it is
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:37,855	| IOT114 |	Because
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,647	| IOT114 |	I got rid of my pixel
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:42,975	| IOT114 |	A few months ago about a Galaxy S8 which has as we know Bixby
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,303	| IOT114 |	I have the assistant on there however I cannot
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,583	| IOT114 |	Use the hot word
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:51,423	| IOT114 |	To trigger the assistant unless the screen is on or the device is plugged in
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:53,727	| IOT114 |	Where's the pixel I guess I could just use it
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,775	| IOT114 |	Getting frustrated by that
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,055	| IOT114 |	Finally
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:59,359	| IOT114 |	There was and I think there still is
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,407	| IOT114 |	A $30 discount on Google home if
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:02,687	| IOT114 |	You
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:05,503	| IOT114 |	Purchase it through Google Express switch
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,295	| IOT114 |	I've never used before
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:09,343	| IOT114 |	It's for new Google Express customers
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:14,719	| IOT114 |	There's a coupon code which may we can put in the show notes we put the link to where I got this information
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,535	| IOT114 |	Said hopefully it still available for people making use it
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,303	| IOT114 |	So
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:24,447	| IOT114 |	I sign up for Google Express probably won't use express anymore. Cancel that service but I got $30 off the homestead 99 box so
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:26,751	| IOT114 |	For all those reasons I caved
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:27,263	| IOT114 |	Got to Google
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,543	| IOT114 |	Okay
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:31,103	| IOT114 |	After you've had it I want to hear your experience with
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:31,615	| IOT114 |	Music
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:34,175	| IOT114 |	Because I find the Spotify
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:36,991	| IOT114 |	Integrations if I ask Google to play a song
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,271	| IOT114 |	Can I ask
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,295	| IOT114 |	The echo to play a song
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,855	| IOT114 |	Metal Place the correct song
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,135	| IOT114 |	Cool seems to play like
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:45,183	| IOT114 |	The top voted karaoke version of the song
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:49,023	| IOT114 |	Well I don't want that
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:51,583	| IOT114 |	I may not be the best person to ask however
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:54,143	| IOT114 |	Because I don't use Spotify
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:58,239	| IOT114 |	None of the services I use are actually on Google
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,263	| IOT114 |	App for music
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,543	| IOT114 |	Are you Sirius XM
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:07,455	| IOT114 |	And unfortunately because my family all has iPhones we have an apple music family plan so neither of those work with it
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:11,039	| IOT114 |	Best I'm going to be able to do is use the free version of Google Play Music
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,159	| IOT114 |	But at the fact
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,183	| IOT114 |	Your music library
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,023	| IOT114 |	We have gone
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:21,791	| IOT114 |	So far
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:26,911	| IOT114 |	It doesn't work across many devices I kind of feel along with smart watches
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:28,703	| IOT114 |	Music is actually a lock-in
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,471	| IOT114 |	4
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:31,263	| IOT114 |	Assistance as well as smart watches
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:33,567	| IOT114 |	I agree
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,383	| IOT114 |	I do not Apple
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:37,407	| IOT114 |	Apple though
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:39,199	| IOT114 |	Is getting even more
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:40,479	| IOT114 |	Locked in
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,015	| IOT114 |	Vertically integrated
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,807	| IOT114 |	There is a report out
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:48,159	| IOT114 |	Last week the apple is designing its own a iPhone chip
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:54,815	| IOT114 |	This is pretty exciting news totally fits with the Apple ecosystem where Apple was be
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:59,423	| IOT114 |	The first phone manufacturer to release
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:02,751	| IOT114 |	Decided to sign its own arm-based chips for the
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,519	| IOT114 |	The phone
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:05,055	| IOT114 |	Those are the
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,591	| IOT114 |	Slash number processors
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,919	| IOT114 |	5272 that's area
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:15,551	| IOT114 |	Oh okay I said where to the A9 Axor
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,647	| IOT114 |	So
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,671	| IOT114 |	Apple does that
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:22,975	| IOT114 |	They also design their own chips
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:23,999	| IOT114 |	For their Wireless
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:24,767	| IOT114 |	Headphones
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,279	| IOT114 |	Actually
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:26,815	| IOT114 |	WW1
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:27,839	| IOT114 |	Yes and
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:30,911	| IOT114 |	They were one of the first to create a
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:33,471	| IOT114 |	A sensor unit sensor processing
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:33,983	| IOT114 |	So that
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:35,519	| IOT114 |	It's their m
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:43,199	| IOT114 |	This is not crazy that Apple would say you know what
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:50,367	| IOT114 |	This whole day I think this this basically execution this inference of artificial intelligence algorithms
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,391	| IOT114 |	We got a separate that
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,927	| IOT114 |	We got to put that someplace else in
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,719	| IOT114 |	Design something special
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:55,743	| IOT114 |	For that
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:15:02,911	| IOT114 |	The reason they can do this is because they sell so many darn iPhones and because it's going to be a huge savings
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:05,471	| IOT114 |	Maybe not huge it will be a savings on battery life
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:07,263	| IOT114 |	It's really important
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:10,591	| IOT114 |	Cuz running these algorithms can take
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:14,687	| IOT114 |	A lot of processing power and also it needs to happen really fast and
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,991	| IOT114 |	You don't want that competing with you know
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:19,039	| IOT114 |	Trying to load your website
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,319	| IOT114 |	Your browser
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,415	| IOT114 |	Magically happy
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,487	| IOT114 |	You know what really sing
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:31,071	| IOT114 |	I'm going to say this and you can correct me if I'm wrong
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,607	| IOT114 |	Is maybe I do have this around the world
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,143	| IOT114 |	In my finger really seeing
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:39,775	| IOT114 |	I must March toward Asics application-specific integrated circuits for
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:42,335	| IOT114 |	Just about everything now every used to be that the
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:45,151	| IOT114 |	The phone processor would just do everything but now we've got
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:47,455	| IOT114 |	And we had digital signal processor
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,247	| IOT114 |	An hour
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:51,039	| IOT114 |	Building chips for AI
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:53,599	| IOT114 |	And building chips for this and billing chips for that
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,903	| IOT114 |	So we can optimize
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:16:00,255	| IOT114 |	As you said the processing power for the right task in the battery life for the right path so we can
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:03,071	| IOT114 |	Get a good mix of a battery life in a Daiso
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:07,679	| IOT114 |	I think you're going to see a lot more this especially with a i and assistance
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:10,495	| IOT114 |	Apple certainly not the only one working on this in my opinion
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:11,775	| IOT114 |	And
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:13,055	| IOT114 |	I'll be curious to see what
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,591	| IOT114 |	Advantages they Tout
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,383	| IOT114 |	If and when this comes out
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:20,223	| IOT114 |	Yes and we talked about the sun previous shows but this is
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:24,063	| IOT114 |	What we talk about is the end of general purpose computing
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:26,879	| IOT114 |	We've come to a point where battery life is so significant
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,903	| IOT114 |	The volume sprayer
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:32,511	| IOT114 |	Not just phone makers but even some of the big wet companies means that they can
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:34,815	| IOT114 |	Build specialized not just equipment
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:35,839	| IOT114 |	What's silicon
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:39,679	| IOT114 |	This is a huge existential
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,703	| IOT114 |	Threat to Intel
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:42,239	| IOT114 |	So I'll just bring that up
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,543	| IOT114 |	Yep it's pretty big one
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,335	| IOT114 |	Kevin we actually forgot
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,359	| IOT114 |	Something we forgot your
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,127	| IOT114 |	Closure sew
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:51,967	| IOT114 |	Retroactive oh yes I will yes so I do work
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:55,551	| IOT114 |	Google I do not work on anything iot related
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,831	| IOT114 |	Then all opinions are my own
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:05,279	| IOT114 |	We do not question
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,303	| IOT114 |	Kevin is
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,399	| IOT114 |	Speaking of chips
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:15,007	| IOT114 |	They finally announced what they're going to do with it dynamic
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:19,103	| IOT114 |	Architecture that they announced probably 3 or 4 months ago
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:23,711	| IOT114 |	How much so they have a new cortex a75
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:26,783	| IOT114 |	55in a brand new Molly chip
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,575	| IOT114 |	Only the cortex chips use the dynamic
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:31,391	| IOT114 |	Which is basically a new way of
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,671	| IOT114 |	Parallel processing multi
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,719	| IOT114 |	Keith reading it's it's better for AI
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,511	| IOT114 |	There's that word again
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:38,815	| IOT114 |	So all of those
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:40,351	| IOT114 |	They're at the more energy efficient
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:41,887	| IOT114 |	Really Nifty
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,423	| IOT114 |	And then the Maui chip is just
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,983	| IOT114 |	It's it's my better graphics chip
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,263	| IOT114 |	It's more power efficient
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:47,775	| IOT114 |	It's
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,311	| IOT114 |	More powerful
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:54,943	| IOT114 |	So we talked about the dynamic
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:58,015	| IOT114 |	CPUs I kind of pillow is a little bit of marketing fluff back in March
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:17:59,039	| IOT114 |	I
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:02,367	| IOT114 |	Kill a little less so in that
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:05,183	| IOT114 |	Instead of comparing big and little chips in terms of
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:07,743	| IOT114 |	High compute and high battery life with
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,535	| IOT114 |	Less computer lower battery life
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:12,351	| IOT114 |	You can mix and match a little bit so you can go up to
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,143	| IOT114 |	Eight-course believe
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:20,543	| IOT114 |	But you can say six or seven of them are low-power and only one is high-power you can
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:24,383	| IOT114 |	Do whatever you need to do for whatever device you're designing so
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,175	| IOT114 |	I'm a little bit
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:32,319	| IOT114 |	You're impressed by that so maybe you can have a record medicated just to machine learning for example
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:33,855	| IOT114 |	And again this is that much
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:38,207	| IOT114 |	This is chi you guys
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,743	| IOT114 |	The theme of the week
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:40,511	| IOT114 |	Bachelor
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:42,815	| IOT114 |	Moving on from chips
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:44,863	| IOT114 |	Verizon
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:47,423	| IOT114 |	Hub
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:48,703	| IOT114 |	Sorta
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:49,983	| IOT114 |	Yeah this is my
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:53,567	| IOT114 |	Okay well this is marketing
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:56,383	| IOT114 |	Can I just say that right in French
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:57,151	| IOT114 |	Okay
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:19:00,735	| IOT114 |	So Verizon put out a press release last week
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:04,319	| IOT114 |	Turn your house into a Verizon 4G LTE home with
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,343	| IOT114 |	Smart Hub
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:07,135	| IOT114 |	That's the name of the product smart
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:08,671	| IOT114 |	Capital S capital h
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:14,303	| IOT114 |	I fail to see the Smart Hub capabilities of it it seems to me like it's basically
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:16,095	| IOT114 |	A way to bring Wireless
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,631	| IOT114 |	Broadband to your house which
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:19,423	| IOT114 |	There's Merit for that
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:21,983	| IOT114 |	People out in rural areas at maybe
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,007	| IOT114 |	They don't have
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:28,895	| IOT114 |	Cable choices FiOS isn't there and so on maybe the other using phones with Hotspots for their primary connectivity
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,431	| IOT114 |	I get it
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,479	| IOT114 |	At this place makes sense it's a $200
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,527	| IOT114 |	4G router essentially
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:38,623	| IOT114 |	But Verizon made a big to-do about how it's going to work well with all of your
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:43,231	| IOT114 |	Smart devices including more than 200 Wi-Fi products and so on and so forth
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:46,559	| IOT114 |	So I'm thinking before even though it's like a router with
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:48,351	| IOT114 |	You know it's that acts as a Smart Hub
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:53,727	| IOT114 |	But it doesn't seem to be that doesn't seem to have those kind of smart that just seems to be a way to have
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:58,079	| IOT114 |	Connectivity for your devices like maybe like a Gateway at best
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:00,127	| IOT114 |	Am I misunderstanding it
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,919	| IOT114 |	Well it looks a little smarter
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:04,479	| IOT114 |	I mean this is still not something I would buy because
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:10,111	| IOT114 |	So basically it's $200 it's got the backup to the 4G network
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:17,023	| IOT114 |	Works on Wi-Fi it connects to over 200 Wi-Fi devices it's got a tiny little OLED screen at the top
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:20,095	| IOT114 |	Tells you how many devices are on your network and some other things
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:23,167	| IOT114 |	And in the app it does let you control
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:24,447	| IOT114 |	In schedule
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:26,239	| IOT114 |	Like routines and that's worth
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:27,775	| IOT114 |	So
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:29,823	| IOT114 |	You can tell anything to
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,103	| IOT114 |	It reminds me of the
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:33,407	| IOT114 |	Routers
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:35,711	| IOT114 |	Become red in in just imaginating 4G
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,271	| IOT114 |	The idea for cheese basically
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:42,111	| IOT114 |	It also has a backup battery so when your power goes out
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:43,903	| IOT114 |	You still have
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,695	| IOT114 |	Cellular connectivity to
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,231	| IOT114 |	Two things that run on batteries
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:51,327	| IOT114 |	Right now it's only has cellular connectivity if I'm not mistaken
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:58,239	| IOT114 |	Well not this early but again for people in rural areas I think it's
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:21:00,543	| IOT114 |	That's good because I don't have many Broadband choices
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:05,151	| IOT114 |	Yes
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:06,687	| IOT114 |	Okay so
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:08,479	| IOT114 |	You got your cellular to Wi-Fi connection
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,783	| IOT114 |	That's yay
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:16,928	| IOT114 |	But if your power goes out you know you're not going to be able to control most of these devices cuz most wifi-based devices which is what this works with
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:20,256	| IOT114 |	They are plugged in because such a Powerhouse
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:21,536	| IOT114 |	Right
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,608	| IOT114 |	That's where I'm kind of
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:28,448	| IOT114 |	It seems like a mish-mosh of
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,984	| IOT114 |	A lot of technology that
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:31,776	| IOT114 |	Doesn't
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,592	| IOT114 |	Yeah I don't think so again
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,640	| IOT114 |	If you don't have good
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:38,432	| IOT114 |	Wired Broadband nagpur
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:39,456	| IOT114 |	Opportunities at your house
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:42,784	| IOT114 |	Then it this might make sense you write will be expensive
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:45,088	| IOT114 |	But at a Smart Hub I just
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:46,368	| IOT114 |	I'm just kind of questioning
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:47,904	| IOT114 |	What kind of man
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:52,000	| IOT114 |	Oh but we do want to talk about so
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,792	| IOT114 |	One of our listeners John
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:56,096	| IOT114 |	Send us an email John
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:22:01,984	| IOT114 |	Morse he actually sent a comment on one of her last blogs that was super helpful so he introduced us to
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:02,752	| IOT114 |	This
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,544	| IOT114 |	TI has a technology called
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:05,568	| IOT114 |	Captivate
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:09,152	| IOT114 |	And it basically is touch technology that
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:10,176	| IOT114 |	That works through
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:10,688	| IOT114 |	Wood
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:14,528	| IOT114 |	Wow that would be so cool he points out the
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,624	| IOT114 |	I agree
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,392	| IOT114 |	Real estate like
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:24,768	| IOT114 |	That I'm I'm very excited about like touch technology that works through Fabrics because I'm like
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:27,584	| IOT114 |	Passive touch screen an arm of your couch
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:31,168	| IOT114 |	Is here there like you could put it on your coffee table as long as it's
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:34,240	| IOT114 |	The MC use can sense their laminated plywood that's up to
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:37,312	| IOT114 |	2.75 in thick in particle board this one inch thick
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:43,712	| IOT114 |	So I don't know I think this is kind of neat right Kevin oh absolutely am it if you can't agree
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:45,248	| IOT114 |	Capacitive touch into wood
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:47,552	| IOT114 |	Products furniture and sex it would be
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,576	| IOT114 |	Great
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:53,952	| IOT114 |	Do you have to plug in your furniture to make this work a minute this says it can run on a battery for a certain amount of time
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:23:00,864	| IOT114 |	Exactly exactly so ideal weight yet
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:07,008	| IOT114 |	You probably want a dedicated power source but if you do that then you think of the possibilities of adding integrated wireless charging to the furniture
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:09,056	| IOT114 |	Is available today but
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:10,336	| IOT114 |	You know this just makes sense.
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:11,616	| IOT114 |	How to
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:13,920	| IOT114 |	Go hand-in-hand with a capacitive touch
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:14,432	| IOT114 |	Element
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:15,456	| IOT114 |	Sound like
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:19,040	| IOT114 |	Again my my sit-stand desk is wood
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:21,088	| IOT114 |	The top and I would love to not have
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:25,440	| IOT114 |	Physical buttons underneath it to raise it or lower it may be great to just go to a
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:28,000	| IOT114 |	Section of the desk itself Express in heaven
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:28,768	| IOT114 |	Do its thing
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,328	| IOT114 |	I would love to see you.
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:34,912	| IOT114 |	We're actually love this I'm like my dining room table
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:36,448	| IOT114 |	Control my dining room light
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:38,240	| IOT114 |	How awesome you'd be like
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:41,312	| IOT114 |	It's a little bright in here at the sun goes down
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:47,456	| IOT114 |	I don't need wireless charging in my
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:48,736	| IOT114 |	Kelso that would
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:51,808	| IOT114 |	Writing rice
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:54,368	| IOT114 |	Okay so there is one downside
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:54,880	| IOT114 |	Would you like to tell
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,440	| IOT114 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:59,488	| IOT114 |	That's the dance I almost forgot about it because it's
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,280	| IOT114 |	Barely mentioned
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:07,936	| IOT114 |	Yes I'm just going to read this flat out from the Press race touch technology embedded in wood might also be subject to moisture
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:08,960	| IOT114 |	Penetration
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:12,800	| IOT114 |	Send me from a spilled drink on the arm of the chair or rain on a door frame
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:20,224	| IOT114 |	So if your knees in your dining room table don't put your drinks down on capacitive coasters
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:21,248	| IOT114 |	There you go
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:22,784	| IOT114 |	So
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,320	| IOT114 |	Really cool technology
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:25,600	| IOT114 |	TI's got it
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,648	| IOT114 |	I thought this was great
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:28,416	| IOT114 |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,464	| IOT114 |	Kris Kristofferson
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:32,768	| IOT114 |	All right
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:35,328	| IOT114 |	I promised you last week that I would talk to you about the
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,632	| IOT114 |	WeMo Wi-Fi
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,400	| IOT114 |	Dimmer
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,168	| IOT114 |	Switch
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:42,752	| IOT114 |	And this is wemo's first dimmer switch
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:46,336	| IOT114 |	They had a normal wifi-connected switch that was on and off and
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:48,128	| IOT114 |	Some people like that some people do not
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:50,944	| IOT114 |	The dimmer switch is $80 so it's
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,224	| IOT114 |	Prasek's
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:54,784	| IOT114 |	My favorite switches which are still Lutron
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:58,112	| IOT114 |	And it's pricier than the Leviton WiFi Decora series
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:25:02,464	| IOT114 |	Play switch I also have installed cuz those are about 50 bucks and they work with the Amazon Echo without a
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:04,256	| IOT114 |	Cuddly trying to work you need to
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:11,168	| IOT114 |	My install process was a little wonky because I've got some crazy wiring so I ran into some trouble
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:11,936	| IOT114 |	In the first spot
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,728	| IOT114 |	So I stuck it in a different
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:17,056	| IOT114 |	And I put it in the bath
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:19,872	| IOT114 |	And this is a
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,152	| IOT114 |	Really nice light
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,688	| IOT114 |	It's got a capacitive touch dimmer
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:27,040	| IOT114 |	So you just move your finger up and down the dimmer which is kind of need to turn the lights
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:31,648	| IOT114 |	LED in it that turns on
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,160	| IOT114 |	When
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:33,184	| IOT114 |	The light
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:39,072	| IOT114 |	Is triggered by something so it turns different colors based on what product has triggered it
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:41,632	| IOT114 |	If that is something really
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:43,168	| IOT114 |	Cool cuz if you set like
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:45,984	| IOT114 |	If you're like me you said a lot of different recipes or
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:49,312	| IOT114 |	Things up and then suddenly your lights are going on and you have no idea why
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:51,360	| IOT114 |	Believe me guys
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:52,128	| IOT114 |	Happens to me more often
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:55,200	| IOT114 |	Be able to look at it
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,248	| IOT114 |	Blue and be like
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:26:00,064	| IOT114 |	Hey. That means I just turned it on with the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:00,832	| IOT114 |	Which
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:04,416	| IOT114 |	Is maybe not a weird thing but if it turns orange that means I've turned it on but if if
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:07,232	| IOT114 |	Which actually is a nice thing because
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,024	| IOT114 |	You know that might be an automation then
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:11,840	| IOT114 |	I like
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:12,352	| IOT114 |	The light
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:17,216	| IOT114 |	To feel it's expensive and then the other things know about it it's got the most
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:18,496	| IOT114 |	Wonderful labeling
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,776	| IOT114 |	Squires
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:20,544	| IOT114 |	Lovely
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:21,312	| IOT114 |	I got to say
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:26,688	| IOT114 |	The switch itself is
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:28,736	| IOT114 |	Freaking huge just so big
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:31,296	| IOT114 |	So if you don't have a lot of room
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:33,088	| IOT114 |	Like I initially try to install it in a
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:33,856	| IOT114 |	3 games
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:35,904	| IOT114 |	Switch and there's a lot of wires crammed back there
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:36,928	| IOT114 |	It wasn't
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:40,000	| IOT114 |	It's bigger even than
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:42,048	| IOT114 |	So it's bigger than electrons
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:45,120	| IOT114 |	It's bigger than the Leviton
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:47,680	| IOT114 |	It goes as bad as deep as the Leviton but it's also a live
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:52,800	| IOT114 |	That's going to be an issue if you don't have a lot of room in the
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,568	| IOT114 |	The back of your switch box
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:55,616	| IOT114 |	Or you can just hire an electrician
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:27:04,320	| IOT114 |	You know it's interesting because all the the boxes and all were designed for a traditional light switches for years and years and
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:06,112	| IOT114 |	Years and now we're adding
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,648	| IOT114 |	Smart sand
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:09,184	| IOT114 |	Chips and
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:10,976	| IOT114 |	Things radios and such
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:13,024	| IOT114 |	Into the switches that I wonder
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:16,608	| IOT114 |	You know how we run out of room in a sentence
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:17,632	| IOT114 |	Man
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:20,448	| IOT114 |	Okay that's a hugely certified product thank God
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:21,472	| IOT114 |	Because you don't
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:30,176	| IOT114 |	Standard standard for a reason
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:30,944	| IOT114 |	Toads
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:31,712	| IOT114 |	I think so
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,736	| IOT114 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:33,760	| IOT114 |	That's going to be
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,784	| IOT114 |	A challenge but
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:37,088	| IOT114 |	But yes it is something to think about
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,368	| IOT114 |	If you don't have a lot of room back there
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:40,160	| IOT114 |	You're going to be folded wires
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:46,560	| IOT114 |	I anticipate embedded speakers maybe even cameras and such and switches
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:49,888	| IOT114 |	Yes there's a lot of weathers motion sensors
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:51,424	| IOT114 |	There's microphone switches
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,008	| IOT114 |	Your relay switch for
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:58,080	| IOT114 |	You have
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:58,592	| IOT114 |	Stick out a little
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:01,152	| IOT114 |	Yes it did
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:02,944	| IOT114 |	So it it moved forward
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:05,248	| IOT114 |	Fred
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,784	| IOT114 |	Which means you could install it in
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:08,320	| IOT114 |	Cycling switch
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:11,136	| IOT114 |	Soda challenge
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:13,184	| IOT114 |	All right
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:14,720	| IOT114 |	Cheapest to think about
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:19,072	| IOT114 |	Alright thank you so much Kevin
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:20,608	| IOT114 |	No
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,376	| IOT114 |	We will
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,144	| IOT114 |	Stay tuned
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:25,216	| IOT114 |	For a Our Guest this week Brett Greenstein for my VM
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,496	| IOT114 |	And
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:32,896	| IOT114 |	Before we talk to him we are going to have a quick message from this week's sponsor hey everyone we
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:39,296	| IOT114 |	Breaking into this week's podcast with the message from our sponsor this we sponsor is Eros and I have
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:43,136	| IOT114 |	Z Hussain who is the CTO and founder of Eros
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:45,184	| IOT114 |	Here to talk to me about
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:47,744	| IOT114 |	Hot markets for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:49,024	| IOT114 |	So
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:50,048	| IOT114 |	Quick Refresher
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,584	| IOT114 |	Tell people what areas is
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:55,424	| IOT114 |	Eros is a company that provides a complete solution
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:59,520	| IOT114 |	From the devices that are located out in the field all the way back
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,288	| IOT114 |	Netflix
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:03,616	| IOT114 |	To the storage and analytic functions that are necessary
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,896	| IOT114 |	Support iot applications
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:11,040	| IOT114 |	From small medium and large Enterprises for their customers or friendly
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:12,576	| IOT114 |	Markets for iot
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:14,368	| IOT114 |	What are the most rapidly growing areas for
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:21,280	| IOT114 |	What are the natural things about cellular which is what we do and provide for connectivity Services is
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:23,840	| IOT114 |	The fact that devices that need to be mobile
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:29,984	| IOT114 |	Can be on our networks are roughly half of the units tend to be in the automotive & Fleet Management space not surprisingly
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:33,056	| IOT114 |	On the other hand one of the largest markets that is
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:38,688	| IOT114 |	Coming up to speed is the healthcare Market because of the impact that iot Solutions can have on the cost
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:43,296	| IOT114 |	Problems that are being encountered in the healthcare Arena that market is exploding
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,320	| IOT114 |	Those are both
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:45,600	| IOT114 |	Really good Industries
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:49,184	| IOT114 |	So how should they think about the trade-offs between
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:50,720	| IOT114 |	Wi-Fi and cellular
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:57,120	| IOT114 |	Surly Wi-Fi tends to be a very ubiquitous solution if it's available in a given
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:30:03,520	| IOT114 |	Residence or given business or given building the only issue is that you have to do a fair amount of configuration
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:05,312	| IOT114 |	To be able to use that Network
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:10,432	| IOT114 |	And not all applications can take advantage of that or the maintenance and debugging and support
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:13,504	| IOT114 |	Can become an issue so people like to be able to use
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:19,904	| IOT114 |	Networks that are dependent on someone locally providing a support activity support system
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:21,440	| IOT114 |	Netflix
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:23,744	| IOT114 |	And to be the method of choice because the network
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:28,864	| IOT114 |	We'll manage that for you Eros managers the device behavior on the network
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,912	| IOT114 |	Because they can reach out and see the device
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:33,728	| IOT114 |	Completely independent of any local setup issue that might
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:36,032	| IOT114 |	So now I know what's hot and how to connect
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,824	| IOT114 |	When should a business
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:38,592	| IOT114 |	Think about
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,128	| IOT114 |	Beginning to implement in Iowa
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:40,896	| IOT114 |	Beauty solution
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:46,016	| IOT114 |	The best time to implement an iot solution is when you know the problem you're trying
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:50,624	| IOT114 |	And you have information that you're trying to get remotely
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:52,416	| IOT114 |	And you have an understanding of what
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:53,696	| IOT114 |	Value that information
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:57,024	| IOT114 |	Has for you your company or your potential
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:31:03,168	| IOT114 |	If you don't take advantage of the fact that data is available and that the solutions that are being implemented in the iot space
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:09,312	| IOT114 |	Can provide you the necessary information in a way that will make meaningful sense their business action
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,360	| IOT114 |	Then that's not the right time to start
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:14,688	| IOT114 |	Where can I find out more about what Arris is doing
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:19,296	| IOT114 |	I want to find out more about iot Solutions and how to deploy
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:24,928	| IOT114 |	And iot solution for their particular problem I would highly recommend that a download a copy of the
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:28,256	| IOT114 |	Free ebook that I have published this available on our website

EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:01,792	| IOT114 |	Actually we've talked
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:05,120	| IOT114 |	You guys and Brett is a font of information
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:05,888	| IOT114 |	About this
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:06,656	| IOT114 |	But that
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:07,168	| IOT114 |	It's not really
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:08,960	| IOT114 |	Talk too much about today
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:10,752	| IOT114 |	Instead we are going to focus
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:12,800	| IOT114 |	Watson's iot business
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:14,592	| IOT114 |	And also a broader question of
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:18,688	| IOT114 |	How do we go from all of the sensor data to actually
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:21,760	| IOT114 |	Taking action or getting valuable insights from it
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:22,784	| IOT114 |	So let's
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:24,064	| IOT114 |	Let's start off
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:24,832	| IOT114 |	Set the hard question
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:26,880	| IOT114 |	I got gobs of data
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:28,416	| IOT114 |	Tracking everything
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:30,464	| IOT114 |	How do I take that
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,232	| IOT114 |	And get from
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,256	| IOT114 |	Data
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:32,768	| IOT114 |	2
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:38,400	| IOT114 |	I think you have to recognize that most of the iot data that people collect today
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:40,192	| IOT114 |	Is probably useless
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:42,496	| IOT114 |	It's only valuable fur
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,264	| IOT114 |	Microseconds
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:45,568	| IOT114 |	It is awesome noise
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:47,360	| IOT114 |	And finding the signal from the noise
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,128	| IOT114 |	Certainly the hard part
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:49,408	| IOT114 |	We found
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:50,944	| IOT114 |	That having model
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:52,992	| IOT114 |	That Define
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:53,504	| IOT114 |	People
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:55,296	| IOT114 |	And places and things
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:56,832	| IOT114 |	How we think they might work
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:58,880	| IOT114 |	Palm is a necessary starting point
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:03,232	| IOT114 |	And then we leverage analytics to look for
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:04,512	| IOT114 |	What's normal and what's not
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:07,328	| IOT114 |	So that could be something
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,864	| IOT114 |	Gets rid of some of the noise
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:10,656	| IOT114 |	Right away for example you can look at
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:11,936	| IOT114 |	Jada coming off the thermostat
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:15,008	| IOT114 |	For the most part doesn't move
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:17,568	| IOT114 |	But if it spikes to 900 Degrees
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:18,848	| IOT114 |	There is probably a serious
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:21,920	| IOT114 |	Or if it drops really quickly is another series
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:24,480	| IOT114 |	Being able to know what's normal what's not
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:27,552	| IOT114 |	Give me done with machine learning algorithms to assess
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:28,320	| IOT114 |	Anomalous Behavior
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:31,136	| IOT114 |	And I could be something that happens in a moment
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:33,440	| IOT114 |	Three happening something happens Trends over time
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:36,000	| IOT114 |	And it has to be based on having some
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:38,560	| IOT114 |	Hypothesis of what's normal
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:42,144	| IOT114 |	But then using analytics to look for the variations in day that I would tell you when those
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:43,424	| IOT114 |	Moments happen
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:47,264	| IOT114 |	NFL really looking for is not the date itself but the moment
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:53,664	| IOT114 |	I just realized that you're going to be a great person to have it because you can probably help me break down
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:55,456	| IOT114 |	A couple concepts for peep
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:58,784	| IOT114 |	Because right now we talked about analytics all the time
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:00,832	| IOT114 |	We also talked about machine learning
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:03,392	| IOT114 |	And then we talked about things like
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:07,232	| IOT114 |	In a lot of people I feel like people kind of just throw those out there
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,536	| IOT114 |	And there he was very interchangeably
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,072	| IOT114 |	I probably shouldn't
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:14,144	| IOT114 |	So maybe you can help us by
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:16,448	| IOT114 |	Helping us set up definitions and how we should
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:17,472	| IOT114 |	Think about each of these
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:17,984	| IOT114 |	Concepts
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:21,312	| IOT114 |	Of course I probably will not use whatever
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:26,688	| IOT114 |	Textbook definitions exist but my own sort of simpler way of breaking it down into what I say three categories
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:28,224	| IOT114 |	When is
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:29,504	| IOT114 |	After data has happened
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:31,296	| IOT114 |	There's
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:35,648	| IOT114 |	Plenty of analytics tools that go in and look at how you can visualize it in pivot it in
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:37,440	| IOT114 |	And sort through it to find
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:40,768	| IOT114 |	Correlations in patterns that you expect to be there and that you're looking
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:47,168	| IOT114 |	You looking for particular moment you know what you're looking for so you kind of sorting through the day that glancing through it and providing
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:51,008	| IOT114 |	Are different different ways of organizing that data that sort of astronaut
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:51,520	| IOT114 |	App
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,056	| IOT114 |	Now
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:54,080	| IOT114 |	Things that happened
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:54,848	| IOT114 |	Wallet
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:56,640	| IOT114 |	Recurring you may have some
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:35:00,992	| IOT114 |	Real-time analytics something that is looking for a set of business rules are conditions
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:06,624	| IOT114 |	That occur as date is flowing in and you're looking for moments are you looking for variations
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:10,208	| IOT114 |	Here's where machine learning can be used to help see if things are trending in a way that is
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:11,488	| IOT114 |	Anomalous
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:12,512	| IOT114 |	So you have you build a
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:14,560	| IOT114 |	Picture of Baseline
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:15,328	| IOT114 |	View
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:19,168	| IOT114 |	And the Machine learning is watching the day does it's coming through every day so that thermostat data
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:20,448	| IOT114 |	Everyday 7 a.m.
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:22,752	| IOT114 |	Probably changes because I change the thermostat
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:28,384	| IOT114 |	It varies with season varies with things and you sort of know what's normal because they machine learning is watching it
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:30,688	| IOT114 |	Animal attacks abnormally you catch
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:36,320	| IOT114 |	So you got the what happens after date it was generated. What's happening as it is being generated
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:37,344	| IOT114 |	City of Learning System
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:40,160	| IOT114 |	Those are two different types
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:41,952	| IOT114 |	I'm not an expert in either one
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:45,024	| IOT114 |	But you got started this assisted learning this is where
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:47,328	| IOT114 |	The machine is catching things and then you're telling
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:49,120	| IOT114 |	Too human interaction
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:52,448	| IOT114 |	Whether these things are correct or not what do they start to approximating model
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:55,520	| IOT114 |	This is how you might training system for example with images
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,312	| IOT114 |	You might see that
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:36:00,384	| IOT114 |	Fifty or a hundred or a thousand images that say this is
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:01,920	| IOT114 |	You know a dog
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:02,944	| IOT114 |	And
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:07,040	| IOT114 |	Each time it has exceeded in and it and then based on that you can correct
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:10,880	| IOT114 |	The next picture you shall it's going to say I think is a dog it might be a cat
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:11,904	| IOT114 |	Incorrect
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:16,256	| IOT114 |	Say what it really is and you keep feeding it and it will continue to approximate
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:19,584	| IOT114 |	And get closer and closer to accuracy based on the wide range of things
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:20,096	| IOT114 |	You see it
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:21,888	| IOT114 |	So this is where this
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:25,728	| IOT114 |	Human intervention in both what you decide to feed it and of course what feedback you got
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:27,776	| IOT114 |	Any of our systems that are
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:30,592	| IOT114 |	Amor vincit that learn on their own
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:32,384	| IOT114 |	And has recently been
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:35,968	| IOT114 |	Several articles about systems for example I just get fed
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:39,808	| IOT114 |	Procedures and things that people do it watches what people do and then learns quickly from that
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:43,392	| IOT114 |	And that's less of the assisted part that's more than the Deep learning Park
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:46,208	| IOT114 |	I would say that the range of these different types of system
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:48,768	| IOT114 |	People tend to lump them into one category
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:49,280	| IOT114 |	Golden Corral
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:52,864	| IOT114 |	Yes thank you for going I know that's a scary question to answer me
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:53,888	| IOT114 |	But you just like rocked it
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:56,960	| IOT114 |	So thank you for that because I do think that
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:59,008	| IOT114 |	When it comes to business
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:01,568	| IOT114 |	It's all lumped together but really
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:05,408	| IOT114 |	For most businesses probably only the first two are really in
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:07,200	| IOT114 |	Important today or the 1st
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:08,480	| IOT114 |	What are your thoughts
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,528	| IOT114 |	What are the most practiced
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:12,576	| IOT114 |	Definitely the more dominant themes today
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:16,416	| IOT114 |	We've all been doing analytic Sunday after his creator for a very long time we
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:19,488	| IOT114 |	Italy called analytics and we called a big data cuz it was more buzzworthy
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:25,120	| IOT114 |	But also effectively visualizing and pivoting data in different tables and different structures so you could see it
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:26,656	| IOT114 |	And to look for patterns or looking
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:28,960	| IOT114 |	Before but I think this idea of
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:35,616	| IOT114 |	Systems that can learn that are assisted is is clearly grown is almost every process and every industry
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:36,384	| IOT114 |	Primarily
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:39,712	| IOT114 |	Because we're really bad at doing something more than a few times
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:40,736	| IOT114 |	Wenis
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:47,904	| IOT114 |	And if you can bring the very best at what you do into the systems and they can learn you can improve that you can improve the repeater bill
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:48,928	| IOT114 |	You can do it at scale
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:50,976	| IOT114 |	In ways that people can
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:53,536	| IOT114 |	But we're still unique and be able to tell a dog from a cat
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:56,352	| IOT114 |	Until we teach our system and then it can tell
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:58,144	| IOT114 |	Not every time not perfectly
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:37:59,424	| IOT114 |	The better and better than my teacher
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:00,704	| IOT114 |	All right
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:01,728	| IOT114 |	Let's think about
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:03,520	| IOT114 |	From a business perspective
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:04,288	| IOT114 |	Because
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:05,824	| IOT114 |	Is nothing if not
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:06,848	| IOT114 |	Which I love
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:10,944	| IOT114 |	How are customers trying to use
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:12,480	| IOT114 |	Assisted machine learning so
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:13,504	| IOT114 |	Will call Watson
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:15,296	| IOT114 |	That feels like an assistant machine learning
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,064	| IOT114 |	Kind of Technology
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:18,624	| IOT114 |	How are they using that for iot
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:20,928	| IOT114 |	Why was
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:25,536	| IOT114 |	We got some really great clients for using visual recognition to help manage drones
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:28,096	| IOT114 |	In a particular leveraging
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:32,704	| IOT114 |	Training of different things you might look for in a drone that might be inspecting power lines
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:33,472	| IOT114 |	Example
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:34,240	| IOT114 |	If we can catch
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:35,776	| IOT114 |	Defects and problems
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:39,360	| IOT114 |	Was it your own operating from perspectives that people can't
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:41,152	| IOT114 |	And catch things
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,176	| IOT114 |	Are more subtle
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:44,224	| IOT114 |	And it's faster than people can
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:48,576	| IOT114 |	It makes our jobs easier cuz we can direct people to go fix the things that need to be fixed
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:50,112	| IOT114 |	You know exactly what's wrong
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:50,880	| IOT114 |	Things
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:54,976	| IOT114 |	And it's a very powerful technology so we're using visual recognition
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:56,768	| IOT114 |	Unmanned drones over Powerline
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:58,816	| IOT114 |	And we can use it in all the variety of settings
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:01,888	| IOT114 |	Where that perspective is unique with a drone has a
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:03,680	| IOT114 |	A bird's-eye view that people don't have
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:05,216	| IOT114 |	Well season
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:09,568	| IOT114 |	So we done a lot of really great work with several companies bringing
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:12,128	| IOT114 |	An image recognition to help do defect analysis
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:12,640	| IOT114 |	A manufacturer
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,944	| IOT114 |	And my very first job
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:16,480	| IOT114 |	A really long time ago
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:21,344	| IOT114 |	I was doing visual inspection and now there's a Semiconductor Company using Watson to do that
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,368	| IOT114 |	Probably much better than I ever
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:24,160	| IOT114 |	And faster
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:28,512	| IOT114 |	But the other part is it can also learn and change over time you may find that this machine
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:31,328	| IOT114 |	10 Siskiyou Loop celestin Island
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:32,864	| IOT114 |	She doesn't over there
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:36,960	| IOT114 |	So instead of paying people to catch all these variations you can also train systems in
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:39,776	| IOT114 |	Deploy different models to different tools and manufacturing line
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:41,568	| IOT114 |	Say something unique that's as well
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:43,872	| IOT114 |	What's a very powerful way to scale out
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:44,896	| IOT114 |	Speed up
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:48,736	| IOT114 |	We're doing similar things with acoustic Analytics
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:50,784	| IOT114 |	I'm listening for the sounds that are normal
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:53,088	| IOT114 |	Knowing if a machine is about to
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:55,392	| IOT114 |	Break a bearing filling is in a house
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:56,672	| IOT114 |	Brookneal glass broke
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:57,696	| IOT114 |	Siamese
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:39:59,232	| IOT114 |	Actually break into something like that
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:03,072	| IOT114 |	Anything we can do that sort of listens and understands acoustic data
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:04,864	| IOT114 |	And learn from that what
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:06,400	| IOT114 |	Things are good or bad
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:09,472	| IOT114 |	And then knowing what to do with those moments and we do similar things with boys
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:11,776	| IOT114 |	Personality assessment
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:17,920	| IOT114 |	Damn I tell you a lot about the feedback of your customers or how people are feeling in an elevator we find it all that unstructured data
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:20,480	| IOT114 |	Really lends itself to these cities Learning System
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:23,296	| IOT114 |	Just go there cuz you brought up a cyst
EDL	00:40:24,576	00:40:29,440	| IOT114 |	Should I talk to all kinds of assistance in my home I talk to companies who are trying to bring
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:32,256	| IOT114 |	Voice assistant to the Enterprise it feels like
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:36,864	| IOT114 |	This should be a perfect place for Watson or the Watson technology
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:39,936	| IOT114 |	It isn't I never people do not talk about Watson
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:41,216	| IOT114 |	In that sense so
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:43,776	| IOT114 |	Should they be or is Watson something else
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:49,408	| IOT114 |	Now they should be and they are but you'll often see that we're the technology inside a lot of things
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:50,688	| IOT114 |	So that makes it harder
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:52,736	| IOT114 |	I also think that the consumer
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:56,832	| IOT114 |	Excitement and energy around assistance you can buy in a store and bring it to your house
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:41:00,672	| IOT114 |	Is very very high and it sucks a lot of the energy on conversation
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:03,232	| IOT114 |	It's on a bad thing because I think it's also
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:04,256	| IOT114 |	Created
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,536	| IOT114 |	A level of comfort
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:09,376	| IOT114 |	That voice interaction and assistants are part of our lives
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:11,680	| IOT114 |	You said you have many in your house I have
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:12,960	| IOT114 |	One of everything
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:13,984	| IOT114 |	More than one of everything
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:15,776	| IOT114 |	In my house also and
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:17,312	| IOT114 |	I like their differences
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:18,336	| IOT114 |	Different things
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:23,200	| IOT114 |	Maybe I'm working early adopter but I think for all of us we're going to realize that there's going to be
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:26,784	| IOT114 |	You know the systems and different places we're going to be more comfortable working with them everywhere
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:28,320	| IOT114 |	Because I couldn't be good at something
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:33,952	| IOT114 |	Will IBM we bring a watch in a natural language and Enzo amore
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:36,256	| IOT114 |	Deeper view of understanding people
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:40,096	| IOT114 |	Dental assistants that were doing in hotels in concierge and
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:43,424	| IOT114 |	In various settings and you'll see much more of it in a publicly
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:46,496	| IOT114 |	The programme call with Watson that has watching embedded in things
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:50,848	| IOT114 |	You'll even see if you go to the weather company app we have watching embedded down the weather at 4
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:53,663	| IOT114 |	But consumers were introducing more and more
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:57,247	| IOT114 |	Dialogue-driven insightful Services even into the weather company
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,527	| IOT114 |	This is something that
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:00,831	| IOT114 |	That we felt that we could bring a dialogue and
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:02,879	| IOT114 |	And engaging kind of service with Watson
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:09,023	| IOT114 |	Get a consumer that we can do it in cars we can do it in hotels other places so we're working with clients all around the world
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:09,791	| IOT114 |	To bring
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:11,327	| IOT114 |	A deeper understanding of people
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:13,375	| IOT114 |	Using watching in those settings
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:16,703	| IOT114 |	And we also obviously do it in the Enterprise at so you won't see
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:17,727	| IOT114 |	The same level of
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:18,495	| IOT114 |	Chatter
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:20,287	| IOT114 |	About what we're doing in the Enterprise
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:23,359	| IOT114 |	But watching has a rich set of engagements across almost every into
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:26,175	| IOT114 |	We talked so much about the cognitive era
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:26,943	| IOT114 |	And
EDL	00:42:26,943	00:42:28,223	| IOT114 |	1 things I like this
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:29,247	| IOT114 |	The thought that
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:30,015	| IOT114 |	This is not
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:31,807	| IOT114 |	A passing thing
EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:34,623	| IOT114 |	It's one of those things that a eyes now and see using the way we work
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:38,975	| IOT114 |	The systems we use where you can comfortable with Chad and the faces
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:43,839	| IOT114 |	Half the time you talk to somebody internet you don't even know if it's a real person or or chatbot or something else helping you
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:47,167	| IOT114 |	We're getting used to it this is the beginning of an era
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:50,239	| IOT114 |	More so than a passing technology face
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:52,543	| IOT114 |	Go smart phone may come and go
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:53,567	| IOT114 |	I don't know
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:54,847	| IOT114 |	Come and go
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:58,943	| IOT114 |	But cognition and these are things going to be with us for a very long time only improving over
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:02,527	| IOT114 |	Alright so we talked a little bit about assistance
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:04,319	| IOT114 |	Watson
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:04,831	| IOT114 |	As an assist
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:06,623	| IOT114 |	Just in general
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:08,927	| IOT114 |	Where do you think all of this is heading
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:10,975	| IOT114 |	These voice-activated assistant
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:11,487	| IOT114 |	Throughout my home
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:17,631	| IOT114 |	I think we're moving from a place where people were doing fairly difficult home automation stuff
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:20,959	| IOT114 |	If you were using you know hubs and things and setting up rules and stand
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:27,871	| IOT114 |	Very complicated for most people in early adopters did it and everybody else looks at it like it's a bunch of wires and
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:28,383	| IOT114 |	And scary stuff
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:32,735	| IOT114 |	But I think we're moving to a point where assistants are trainable
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:35,295	| IOT114 |	I already use if this then that
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:39,135	| IOT114 |	With several assistance where I can create my own custom dialog and words and
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:45,023	| IOT114 |	And stop doing people come over you know I can say hello Stacy and Stacy it's been a long time since I've seen you
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:46,815	| IOT114 |	It feels as if you're understood
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:48,863	| IOT114 |	I think it's just an illusion
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:53,471	| IOT114 |	But it's the beginning I think of the expectation people have cuz I tried that recently
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:55,775	| IOT114 |	That someone come over and you look very nice today
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:57,567	| IOT114 |	They looked all around where's the camera
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:44:00,127	| IOT114 |	How did how did that sting on my desk know they look nice today
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:01,663	| IOT114 |	And then they wanted to answer
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:03,455	| IOT114 |	That didn't have a response
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:03,967	| IOT114 |	But I think
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:05,247	| IOT114 |	We leap
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:07,295	| IOT114 |	To wanting to be understood
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:08,575	| IOT114 |	So
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:09,087	| IOT114 |	Quickly
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:11,391	| IOT114 |	That if anything can understand us
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:14,463	| IOT114 |	Really understand how we feel build respond more dynamically
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:15,487	| IOT114 |	We embrace it
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:21,119	| IOT114 |	And I think that's it that's where the future is headed is much more of these assistants and interactive capabilities that
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:23,679	| IOT114 |	We will Embrace as an extension of the family
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:25,983	| IOT114 |	How many people do you know have a Roomba
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:27,519	| IOT114 |	Annabelle is how many of them named it
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:28,799	| IOT114 |	IWatch
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:34,943	| IOT114 |	I think she will get very comfortable with this idea there's something they're taking care of them listening to them understanding
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:40,319	| IOT114 |	I got a bunch of experiments in my own house that that replicate the feeling of that
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:43,391	| IOT114 |	And I'm amazed how quickly even non-technical people
EDL	00:44:43,391	00:44:44,671	| IOT114 |	Yeah kind of excited about it
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:46,719	| IOT114 |	This idea is
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:50,559	| IOT114 |	Device has been and what I want
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:51,071	| IOT114 |	Before I
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:56,447	| IOT114 |	Absolutely why should you have to ask to turn on down your lights when you come downstairs
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:45:02,591	| IOT114 |	Your home should turn your lights on for you it should say good morning Stacy it's nice to see you it's going to rain today don't forget your umbrella
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:04,127	| IOT114 |	Your car is low on gas
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:06,431	| IOT114 |	Not all at once
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:12,831	| IOT114 |	You should get it should understand you and the state of your home and where you are where you're going and
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:15,903	| IOT114 |	Offer things rather than waiting for you to keep asking
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:20,255	| IOT114 |	Lights turn to Blue unlock front door start car you shouldn't have to say all this
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:22,047	| IOT114 |	How far away are we
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:23,071	| IOT114 |	Something like that
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:26,911	| IOT114 |	Could happen faster than we think just as the smartphone became
EDL	00:45:27,423	00:45:28,447	| IOT114 |	Something that we
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:34,847	| IOT114 |	People embraced much quicker than we expected cuz it's basically a computer in people's pockets I mean it was a time when that sounded ridiculous
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:36,639	| IOT114 |	And now not having one's ridiculous
EDL	00:45:36,639	00:45:40,223	| IOT114 |	I think we're only a few years away from from having a much more Interactive
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:43,295	| IOT114 |	Home Hotel car environment that is
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:44,831	| IOT114 |	Proactive
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:48,671	| IOT114 |	And anticipates our needs and suggest things at the right time and
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:49,951	| IOT114 |	Feels like an extension
EDL	00:45:50,463	00:45:51,487	| IOT114 |	BB do
EDL	00:45:51,487	00:45:52,255	| IOT114 |	Not
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:53,023	| IOT114 |	Sucking it in
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:57,375	| IOT114 |	It's invasive and not something that is going to have to ask for all the commands to
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:46:03,007	| IOT114 |	So how do we get to that point cuz right now stand
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:05,823	| IOT114 |	I always thought his inconsistent
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:11,455	| IOT114 |	And the thing standing in the way worse things like the expensive getting these devices in
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:14,271	| IOT114 |	And Holmes the lack of standardization
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:15,551	| IOT114 |	Concerns about privacy
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:20,159	| IOT114 |	And I don't even think we'd actually solve the UI challenge
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:21,695	| IOT114 |	We also need to know like
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:25,535	| IOT114 |	Who's wearing a home and getting some of that information out
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:26,047	| IOT114 |	So
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:27,583	| IOT114 |	Are these that
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:28,863	| IOT114 |	Metal water bottle pieces
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:33,727	| IOT114 |	But it is kind of cascading now
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:34,751	| IOT114 |	What started out as
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:38,591	| IOT114 |	Would really like to have it like that was in every science fiction movie for the last 30 years
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:40,383	| IOT114 |	And yet
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:41,663	| IOT114 |	We didn't have anything in our home
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:42,431	| IOT114 |	Back to us
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:45,503	| IOT114 |	Now there's millions of people who do
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:47,295	| IOT114 |	You know you can buy at any store
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:49,599	| IOT114 |	I could do some very very basic things
EDL	00:46:50,111	00:46:52,159	| IOT114 |	So we suddenly now have these endpoints
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:55,743	| IOT114 |	It will be more cuz every company is working on some
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:46:58,303	| IOT114 |	Level of end point whether it's cars in
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:46:59,071	| IOT114 |	Places
EDL	00:46:59,071	00:47:01,887	| IOT114 |	I will be able to at least have a thing to talk to
EDL	00:47:01,887	00:47:03,423	| IOT114 |	But they're not generally very smart yet
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:05,727	| IOT114 |	They're more like a mobile app for The Voice
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:07,007	| IOT114 |	Instead of an actually understand
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:13,919	| IOT114 |	But that's coming through all kinds of different work we've got some really cool work around modeling a people we did it
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:15,967	| IOT114 |	Starting fruit from work on Aging in place
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:19,551	| IOT114 |	Helping people to live better and safer in their home instead of going into
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:21,087	| IOT114 |	I'm Healthcare
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:22,111	| IOT114 |	Facility
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:27,231	| IOT114 |	We started building models of people understanding the better think so we're trying to extend that into some of those
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:28,511	| IOT114 |	Solutions
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:33,119	| IOT114 |	Can I see other companies building voice recognition so that they know who's speaking to it
EDL	00:47:33,119	00:47:37,983	| IOT114 |	Icsolutions around proximity to know based on a mobile device you have who's closest
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:39,007	| IOT114 |	Might be the one talking
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:41,823	| IOT114 |	Together since it might be issuing a command
EDL	00:47:41,823	00:47:44,895	| IOT114 |	So it's kind of all the parallel I think it's just a matter of
EDL	00:47:45,407	00:47:46,687	| IOT114 |	Building up critical mass
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:48,991	| IOT114 |	Some of these Technologies and enough
EDL	00:47:48,991	00:47:50,015	| IOT114 |	Microphone
EDL	00:47:50,015	00:47:53,343	| IOT114 |	Speaker kind of interfaces in people's lives at the Comfort levels are high
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:54,879	| IOT114 |	Incremental cost is low
EDL	00:47:55,391	00:47:57,439	| IOT114 |	The cloud services are very very expensive
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:58,207	| IOT114 |	To deliver this
EDL	00:47:58,719	00:48:02,303	| IOT114 |	They just require some Innovation some companies to really step forward and take
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:03,583	| IOT114 |	A little bit of risk
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:05,375	| IOT114 |	Introducing the new technology
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:08,191	| IOT114 |	All right and what I think about these
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:09,471	| IOT114 |	In this future
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:11,775	| IOT114 |	I think about the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:48:11,775	00:48:13,311	| IOT114 |	Google home
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:14,335	| IOT114 |	Atlas Siri
EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:15,871	| IOT114 |	What's wrong in there
EDL	00:48:16,383	00:48:17,151	| IOT114 |	Apple
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:19,455	| IOT114 |	I don't think so where is Watson
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:25,599	| IOT114 |	Well watches working with the consumer electronics companies around the world as well as
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:26,879	| IOT114 |	No cars and then
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:28,415	| IOT114 |	Telco providers in others
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:31,743	| IOT114 |	So you'll see us maybe you'll see it so differently than you might see others
EDL	00:48:32,255	00:48:38,143	| IOT114 |	Don't this is a rule for all of us in this and I think for companies that are trying to deliver deeper engagement between their products
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:38,911	| IOT114 |	And users
EDL	00:48:39,423	00:48:41,215	| IOT114 |	Just keep those and watching don't exist
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:41,727	| IOT114 |	Did any of the others
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:48,639	| IOT114 |	But I'm also pleased that there's others out there because they're also bringing the ecosystem of developers to bring me a comfort level with
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:50,687	| IOT114 |	Voice interface is there helping Drive improvements
EDL	00:48:51,199	00:48:52,479	| IOT114 |	Just if nothing else to do
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:53,247	| IOT114 |	Competitiveness
EDL	00:48:53,247	00:48:54,271	| IOT114 |	In speech to text
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:49:01,183	| IOT114 |	Which basically hasn't changed much for most people you know in decades and suddenly now has improved dramatically because of
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:01,951	| IOT114 |	Competition
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:04,767	| IOT114 |	Machine learning volumes of users things like that so
EDL	00:49:05,279	00:49:07,839	| IOT114 |	I think you'll see watching in many
EDL	00:49:07,839	00:49:10,911	| IOT114 |	Things you buy that directly engage with consumers where
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:12,959	| IOT114 |	Engagement is the value proposition
EDL	00:49:12,959	00:49:13,727	| IOT114 |	4
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:14,751	| IOT114 |	Car manufacturers in others
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:20,127	| IOT114 |	And you'll see home assistance whether it's Google or Amazon or others I'll be seeing lots of homes
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:21,919	| IOT114 |	I'm hoping there's some
EDL	00:49:21,919	00:49:28,319	| IOT114 |	Emerging standard to happen here I'm still have yet to see it that would allow application developers to build things that are fixed
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:29,599	| IOT114 |	Environment
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:31,391	| IOT114 |	So I still have yet to see
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:34,207	| IOT114 |	That kind of sanitization occur which is what happened in
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:35,743	| IOT114 |	Open HTML in
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:40,351	| IOT114 |	Job and everything else for Bixby to build for one web server move to another I think eventually you'll see
EDL	00:49:40,863	00:49:44,703	| IOT114 |	Expertise and skills and applications in a voice interface be a little less
EDL	00:49:45,215	00:49:49,055	| IOT114 |	Stuck in an ecosystem in more open so we're obviously aiming for openness
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:51,871	| IOT114 |	And I'd like to see iot devices be
EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:53,663	| IOT114 |	As open as possible how they integrate
EDL	00:49:53,663	00:49:54,943	| IOT114 |	And which I'm seeing through
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:57,503	| IOT114 |	Things like asking others that are not tight anyone
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:58,015	| IOT114 |	Tickler system
EDL	00:49:58,783	00:50:00,575	| IOT114 |	All right Brett thank you so much for
EDL	00:50:02,367	00:50:06,719	| IOT114 |	You're very welcome cuz you talking to Stacy as always
EDL	00:50:06,719	00:50:13,119	| IOT114 |	That's it for this week's show thank you so much for listening and if you want more
EDL	00:50:13,119	00:50:19,519	| IOT114 |	Aot news you can sign up for my newsletter Stacey knows things at Stacey on iot
EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:20,287	| IOT114 |	Come
EDL	00:50:20,287	00:50:21,311	| IOT114 |	Will see you next week
