EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:40,608	| IOT176 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:41,376	| IOT176 |	Hearables
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:44,192	| IOT176 |	We've talked about this before we had a guest in April
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:47,264	| IOT176 |	That was a fun conversation
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:49,056	| IOT176 |	Talk about perception
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:50,080	| IOT176 |	Sounded
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:54,176	| IOT176 |	All the kind of things you could actually cream into her hair bows and then you pointed out this
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:56,992	| IOT176 |	Fast Company article on Doppler Labs switch
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:02:02,624	| IOT176 |	It's no longer around but it's not it's not but it had a lot of influence on what's happening with
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,392	| IOT176 |	Apple
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:05,440	| IOT176 |	Google and Amazon these days
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:11,840	| IOT176 |	For those who are not familiar with Doppler labs they came out with the here one wireless earbuds and
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,376	| IOT176 |	News for traditional music
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,144	| IOT176 |	Earbuds
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:17,984	| IOT176 |	Also they could amplify external noise could even
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:22,336	| IOT176 |	Translate languages in your ear so you can have a conversation in another country
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,104	| IOT176 |	Criminal law
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:24,640	| IOT176 |	Into these little earbuds
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:28,736	| IOT176 |	But they face the challenge that many new hardware devices
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,272	| IOT176 |	Space battery life is
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:33,600	| IOT176 |	Really tricky when you have such a small things that isn't your bud
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:40,000	| IOT176 |	And you're cramming all kinds of processing power into the earbuds so you're right they're not here anymore even folks friendly with
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:41,280	| IOT176 |	Froggy or Froggie
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:47,680	| IOT176 |	They had the dash headphones that were very similar and just like the here ones the reviews were just terrible bragi
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:48,704	| IOT176 |	Is now licensing Airsoft
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:52,544	| IOT176 |	Are so but yeah this is a good article because it really shows the influence
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:54,336	| IOT176 |	What I think is
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,616	| IOT176 |	And I don't know if you agree but
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:58,944	| IOT176 |	Maybe the next big wearable type device that
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,712	| IOT176 |	We are
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:01,504	| IOT176 |	Looking at once week workouts
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:04,320	| IOT176 |	Some Kinks yes I totally agree in what
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,600	| IOT176 |	More I think
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,624	| IOT176 |	This is kind of the few
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:08,160	| IOT176 |	Future and not just because I loved
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,928	| IOT176 |	The movie Her
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:09,696	| IOT176 |	I think
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:11,232	| IOT176 |	We've been very focused on screen
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,024	| IOT176 |	For good reason
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:16,608	| IOT176 |	And we still are I mean even if we look at things things like Google Glass
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,656	| IOT176 |	Heads-up displays it's very screen Centric
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:19,936	| IOT176 |	But I think
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:21,216	| IOT176 |	We could do a lot
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:21,984	| IOT176 |	With
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,008	| IOT176 |	Information
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:23,776	| IOT176 |	Delivered
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:27,104	| IOT176 |	Audibly over-the-ear and maybe with like a
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:27,872	| IOT176 |	Companion haptic
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,408	| IOT176 |	So
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,432	| IOT176 |	Maya mean
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:33,248	| IOT176 |	Think about things like directions like when you're walking around
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,528	| IOT176 |	The city and you're just like
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:38,880	| IOT176 |	You're hearing from the phone that you're looking at the phone to see where you turn right or left but
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,160	| IOT176 |	Having a device that
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:40,928	| IOT176 |	I can just say
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:41,696	| IOT176 |	Turn right here
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,232	| IOT176 |	That's amazing
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,000	| IOT176 |	Having
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,768	| IOT176 |	A device
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:46,816	| IOT176 |	You can just ask a question of
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:52,192	| IOT176 |	Then get the answer we have that in our homes so putting that inner ear for travel purposes
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,728	| IOT176 |	Makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:58,336	| IOT176 |	It doesn't actually work getting there already and those two particular instances
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:02,944	| IOT176 |	For example when I wear my Apple watch when I get directions and walking around town where you when I'm driving
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:03,712	| IOT176 |	When I get to
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:07,040	| IOT176 |	Turn in the direction C it will give me a haptic feedback
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:09,088	| IOT176 |	In advance of it will be like two beeps
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:14,720	| IOT176 |	Go to buses for laughed and three for a ride so I'm already starting to get that in certain places with the Apple watch
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:15,744	| IOT176 |	And there are
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,024	| IOT176 |	Various headphones
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:21,119	| IOT176 |	What's that have built-in Google assistant or Madam a
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:23,423	| IOT176 |	Siri for example that give you information
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:29,823	| IOT176 |	What's nice about it is you're right it's like a whisper in your ear nobody else knows that you're getting that information I think that's part of the next step
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:31,103	| IOT176 |	Stop here right we don't want
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:33,151	| IOT176 |	Distracting type interactions
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,687	| IOT176 |	Yes baby will stop walking
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,455	| IOT176 |	In the manholes
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,735	| IOT176 |	Because that is a thing that happens
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:40,831	| IOT176 |	I'm excited about this and then there's the next level which is
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:43,647	| IOT176 |	Hey I'm getting kind of old and
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,183	| IOT176 |	My hearing is maybe not
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:45,951	| IOT176 |	Is awesome is it
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:46,463	| IOT176 |	Used to be
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:48,255	| IOT176 |	So having a device that can
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,839	| IOT176 |	Help me hear what I need to hear in May
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:53,887	| IOT176 |	Fade Out background conversations
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,167	| IOT176 |	That's really
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:55,935	| IOT176 |	Compelling
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:05:01,823	| IOT176 |	And I'm raising my hand because I actually fit into that category I have problems hearing things when there's a lot of background noise
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:05,151	| IOT176 |	So when my family watching TV and talking to me
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:07,711	| IOT176 |	I can't understand them so I actually did buy
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:12,831	| IOT176 |	Acorn horrible from nuheara earlier this year the eye cubits and
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,623	| IOT176 |	Again they function as a music player
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:21,023	| IOT176 |	And they also amplify sound so I can like sit and watch my TV in my office and not have it blurry
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:25,375	| IOT176 |	Hearing so I can hear it because it drowns out the girls watching TV downstairs and I turn to a normal level
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,167	| IOT176 |	I just wear the iqbuds
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,447	| IOT176 |	What
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:28,959	| IOT176 |	What
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:30,239	| IOT176 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,007	| IOT176 |	Except
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:31,775	| IOT176 |	I had to
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:35,103	| IOT176 |	So the point is in the reason why were talking about it on the show is cuz
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:37,663	| IOT176 |	I really believe that this is going to be
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,967	| IOT176 |	I'm just saying the Next Generation
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,735	| IOT176 |	Computing platform
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:45,087	| IOT176 |	The challenges we're going to have to come up with is figuring out battery life
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,623	| IOT176 |	Things like wireless charging
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:52,511	| IOT176 |	Only go so far I have some wireless headphones that do last for 5 hours cuz they don't do anything
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:55,327	| IOT176 |	But
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,863	| IOT176 |	Charging them in the charging cases
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:59,935	| IOT176 |	It's fairly simple so figuring out a way to
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:03,007	| IOT176 |	Compensate for poor battery life doing things like
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:05,311	| IOT176 |	Betteredge kind of processing
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:07,103	| IOT176 |	Power that Stila
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,127	| IOT176 |	Thing that needs to happen
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,919	| IOT176 |	What else might we need
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:13,759	| IOT176 |	I think better life is the Big Challenge because again it's it's just
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,783	| IOT176 |	Space limitation
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:16,319	| IOT176 |	Write the computing
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:19,135	| IOT176 |	Either you're going to need to cram more and more into smaller
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:19,903	| IOT176 |	Chips
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:24,255	| IOT176 |	But that's a given that's happening that's pretty standard with any Computing platform
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,791	| IOT176 |	There is a technology
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,327	| IOT176 |	For hearing aids
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,631	| IOT176 |	So it's called probabilistic
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:33,727	| IOT176 |	And the idea is instead of computing on every 011
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:35,263	| IOT176 |	You computer to slightly less
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,799	| IOT176 |	Accurate rate to save on energy
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,591	| IOT176 |	Very simplistic way of
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,895	| IOT176 |	But it is a known technology that
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,431	| IOT176 |	I've been researching
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,223	| IOT176 |	The challenges
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:45,247	| IOT176 |	Doing that at
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,015	| IOT176 |	Scale
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,319	| IOT176 |	Requires a device that is sold at
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:52,415	| IOT176 |	So I'd be curious as we see major manufacturers
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:52,927	| IOT176 |	Like Apple
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:55,231	| IOT176 |	Ace Hardware Samsung
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:07:00,607	| IOT176 |	Will they find enough use for something like that to basically create a whole new type of
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,631	| IOT176 |	Computing platform
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:05,471	| IOT176 |	I think so and I just say that because
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:11,871	| IOT176 |	Have your very first point about getting away from screens voices the new user interface these days but there are times when voice doesn't make sense
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,663	| IOT176 |	Cenote if your assistance going to announce
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:16,223	| IOT176 |	Personal information now so the world will that kind of
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:20,831	| IOT176 |	Stinks so I think we're getting away from the screens and this is the next
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:21,855	| IOT176 |	Spread your next
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:24,927	| IOT176 |	Step to add information to you in a non-intrusive way
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:26,719	| IOT176 |	So I do think there's definitely
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,255	| IOT176 |	And I suspect there that's appealing
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,279	| IOT176 |	And additionally just
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:33,887	| IOT176 |	Going back to the hearing assistance new hearing aids
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,911	| IOT176 |	Expensive
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:41,311	| IOT176 |	You talking several thousand dollars I didn't look and see how long the batteries last I know they all have replaceable batteries with us app
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:45,407	| IOT176 |	There's a whole new category for these horrible is called
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:48,223	| IOT176 |	Personal sound amplification products for peace out
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:49,247	| IOT176 |	And that's
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:51,295	| IOT176 |	What I bought that's worth a lot of these things are
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:52,063	| IOT176 |	They're not
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:54,111	| IOT176 |	Subject to FDA
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:54,623	| IOT176 |	Regulation
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:57,183	| IOT176 |	And that's important because
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,463	| IOT176 |	Anybody can buy them over the counter
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:01,535	| IOT176 |	I wonder what the impact is going to be for
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,815	| IOT176 |	The hearing aid industry as a result
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:05,119	| IOT176 |	You should listen to that podcast for back
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,143	| IOT176 |	We do talk about
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,471	| IOT176 |	Is her name number
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:10,495	| IOT176 |	Yes she was
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,775	| IOT176 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,543	| IOT176 |	Well
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:16,127	| IOT176 |	I don't think we're going to solve the hero's power problem anytime soon but
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:19,199	| IOT176 |	Keep an eye out I know Kevin and I have been for a while
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,271	| IOT176 |	Just keep an eye out for these kind of innovation
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:26,111	| IOT176 |	Cuz they are coming and they're going to creep up on us
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,927	| IOT176 |	Who called the iPhone
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:29,695	| IOT176 |	Echo
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:35,071	| IOT176 |	Okay I don't think we never talk to each other again
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,863	| IOT176 |	Maybe we
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,399	| IOT176 |	Next up
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| IOT176 |	Apple
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,447	| IOT176 |	Joined the thread group
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,495	| IOT176 |	What did you think about that
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,031	| IOT176 |	I think it's
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:48,383	| IOT176 |	Big potential news for homekit because it opens up
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,919	| IOT176 |	The door to other
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,943	| IOT176 |	Radio protocol
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:55,039	| IOT176 |	For homekit devices cuz right now it's just Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,063	| IOT176 |	It's
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:09:00,671	| IOT176 |	I mean apples every deliberate they don't join groups or standards that they don't plan to use
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:06,047	| IOT176 |	I didn't just join the third group they are a sponsor top-tier level they're on the board of directors now
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:09,375	| IOT176 |	The pan of sum of money each year now so
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,399	| IOT176 |	I suspect
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:12,959	| IOT176 |	They will use thread the question is with what and how
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,263	| IOT176 |	Yes so in this
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,543	| IOT176 |	I was super excited about big
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,871	| IOT176 |	As you've mentioned before Kevin
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,663	| IOT176 |	Right now punk it is only
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,943	| IOT176 |	Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:27,807	| IOT176 |	And that leaves out a chunk of devices and that's why we've got hubs for like our
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,575	| IOT176 |	Hue light bulbs
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,343	| IOT176 |	That sort of thing
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:29,855	| IOT176 |	With
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:33,951	| IOT176 |	Thread which uses the same underlying radio as
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,719	| IOT176 |	Zippy
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:39,327	| IOT176 |	802. 15.4 what could happen is maybe we'd Co
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,607	| IOT176 |	Apple supporting
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:44,703	| IOT176 |	That radio protocol which means maybe we could get pure hubs in our lives
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,983	| IOT176 |	The alternative
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,263	| IOT176 |	Because I have seen
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:49,055	| IOT176 |	Arm actually a couple years ago showed
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,615	| IOT176 |	Thread over Bluetooth radio
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,663	| IOT176 |	And I talk to other chipmakers
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:55,711	| IOT176 |	To have experimental but don't have
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,991	| IOT176 |	Production stuff
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:57,759	| IOT176 |	Read over
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:58,527	| IOT176 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,295	| IOT176 |	Radios
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:03,135	| IOT176 |	So it could open us up two more protocols but it also might just be like
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:07,231	| IOT176 |	Same stuff but now you've got direct IP access
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,023	| IOT176 |	Which is one of the things
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:11,071	| IOT176 |	What's the thread is both a mesh protocol
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:13,887	| IOT176 |	It's low power and its IPv6
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,655	| IOT176 |	Capable
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,423	| IOT176 |	Which means you go Direct
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,471	| IOT176 |	Write what I
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:19,263	| IOT176 |	I would hope for assuming
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:19,775	| IOT176 |	Apple does
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:22,079	| IOT176 |	Use this for zigbee devices
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,359	| IOT176 |	What that would do
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:25,663	| IOT176 |	What is manufacturers would not have to make
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:29,503	| IOT176 |	Two versions of devices right now there are some door locks
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:31,295	| IOT176 |	Example there's a virgin
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,063	| IOT176 |	There's a home cover
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:36,671	| IOT176 |	That's a challenge for the smaller device makers right so it's limited
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,231	| IOT176 |	The number of devices that you have available for
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:42,303	| IOT176 |	Choice in home care if they were to adopt
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,071	| IOT176 |	Zigbee
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:43,583	| IOT176 |	With thread
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:47,167	| IOT176 |	Then that would make life a lot easier for
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,191	| IOT176 |	Consumer stand for device
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:50,495	| IOT176 |	Yeah because I did a lot of
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,031	| IOT176 |	Consumers have to choose their like
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:11:00,735	| IOT176 |	Yes a limited class of device but I also have devices that they may not work with other smart home hubs so
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,271	| IOT176 |	Let's see what happens
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:06,879	| IOT176 |	My hope is that we're going to see some interesting things so you know I dog an apple
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:07,391	| IOT176 |	A lot for
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:11,487	| IOT176 |	It is Well executed but it is so limited and it is
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,767	| IOT176 |	So brutal to be at home
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,047	| IOT176 |	Kit partner
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:18,655	| IOT176 |	They're slow and steady approach the the smartphone market has not evolved
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,423	| IOT176 |	The way I thought it was
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:22,751	| IOT176 |	In the way I hoped it would because I am an open internet
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,287	| IOT176 |	So it's possible that
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:26,591	| IOT176 |	Who is still come out from this sin
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,359	| IOT176 |	Be just fine
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,663	| IOT176 |	It's taken a long time but here I agree
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,711	| IOT176 |	Very possible they will
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:35,295	| IOT176 |	Really expand homekit more than they have in the prior-year so
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:37,855	| IOT176 |	Yeah we'll see who knows maybe I'll be Maricopa
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,183	| IOT176 |	It is
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:43,743	| IOT176 |	So let's move on from the Smart Home
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:44,767	| IOT176 |	To some
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:46,047	| IOT176 |	Industrial and
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:47,583	| IOT176 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:51,423	| IOT176 |	Okay so this week Bane
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:53,471	| IOT176 |	One of the big consulting firms
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:55,775	| IOT176 |	Put out a report noting that the iot
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:56,543	| IOT176 |	She is
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:12:02,943	| IOT176 |	Hey it's a big deal the most notable number that you're seeing everywhere is that it is going to be a 502
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,479	| IOT176 |	20 billion dollar market
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:07,807	| IOT176 |	That will be by 2021
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:09,599	| IOT176 |	It's going to be more than double the
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:14,463	| IOT176 |	235 billion that was spent last year on iot Hardware software
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,999	| IOT176 |	System integration and
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,535	| IOT176 |	Telecom services
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:22,143	| IOT176 |	Like everybody they believe that the Enterprise and Industrial segment circuit
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:26,751	| IOT176 |	Experience the most Revenue growth and they also realized that
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:29,311	| IOT176 |	Most of the executives they interviewed
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:31,615	| IOT176 |	600 they are admitting that
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,639	| IOT176 |	Adoption rates
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,407	| IOT176 |	Are pretty slow
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:36,479	| IOT176 |	And as someone who follows the space this is
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,247	| IOT176 |	Natsu
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:40,575	| IOT176 |	Pricing for the last two years I have seen
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:41,599	| IOT176 |	Many of
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:44,671	| IOT176 |	The company serving the space offering me the exact
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:45,695	| IOT176 |	Same
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:46,719	| IOT176 |	Customer win
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:50,815	| IOT176 |	What is happening is I see a few of those customer win
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:57,215	| IOT176 |	Expanding their stuff but I don't see a lot of new customers that are actually expanding so they're still stuck at the
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,239	| IOT176 |	Concept
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:00,799	| IOT176 |	They call that the pilot purgatory
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:05,919	| IOT176 |	Yeah and I mean I work for two companies I had over a hundred thousand employees and it was
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:12,319	| IOT176 |	Any major change or implementation it was like driving an oil tanker you know you took forever to make a turn
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:14,623	| IOT176 |	There's just so many pieces involving so many
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:21,023	| IOT176 |	Business units that are touched and you got a test everything and get buy-in and also I sort of get that cuz this is like a new frontier
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:21,791	| IOT176 |	Here for Enterprise
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:24,863	| IOT176 |	But what I found interesting in here was
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:29,471	| IOT176 |	Security is on the minds of these people that were interviewed and that's not the surprise of it it's
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:31,263	| IOT176 |	The fact that Bane says
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:33,567	| IOT176 |	These folks would buy more iot devices
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,615	| IOT176 |	And pay more for them if there's
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,639	| IOT176 |	Security concerns for address
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:41,503	| IOT176 |	I just asked him how much more would you pay and they said about 22% more on average
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:44,319	| IOT176 |	Obviously Securities important if we are pain that I ever show
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:48,927	| IOT176 |	But the fact that they're willing to pay a premium for what I think should really be table Stakes is a very interesting
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,463	| IOT176 |	Can I sing
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:52,767	| IOT176 |	It also speaks to an issue with security
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,559	| IOT176 |	Which is people would love to
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,327	| IOT176 |	Payforit
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,095	| IOT176 |	To go away
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:59,935	| IOT176 |	Unfortunately security is not something you can throw money at it's actually a
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:01,983	| IOT176 |	Process is much as it is a technology
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,543	| IOT176 |	Socks
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:10,687	| IOT176 |	I'm not making light of everyone's problem here but it's true you have to train your worker
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:15,295	| IOT176 |	How to behave with this kind of information so they don't get finished or they don't pick up a USB stick in the park
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:18,879	| IOT176 |	You have to train your vendors to
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:21,695	| IOT176 |	Issue update said you have to start thinking about that
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,975	| IOT176 |	When you start sourcing
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:23,487	| IOT176 |	Technology
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:25,279	| IOT176 |	It's not something you can just
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,047	| IOT176 |	Play 4
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:29,375	| IOT176 |	So I'm glad people to pay for it but at the same time I think
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:32,959	| IOT176 |	It's misleading and I would also say another reason
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:38,591	| IOT176 |	One of the other big reasons are not adopting this technology because they don't see a good Roi
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:39,359	| IOT176 |	In quicker
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:42,687	| IOT176 |	And I think again this is not the type of
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,991	| IOT176 |	Yes there are things that you can do to
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:46,015	| IOT176 |	Get an Roi
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:46,783	| IOT176 |	And Technology
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,063	| IOT176 |	This is actually
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,343	| IOT176 |	How much more foundational shih
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:52,927	| IOT176 |	So you're going to be putting in technology
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:56,511	| IOT176 |	Overtime but only if
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,279	| IOT176 |	You understand how
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,071	| IOT176 |	So
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:14:59,839	| IOT176 |	I get why this
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,863	| IOT176 |	Is taking a while
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,143	| IOT176 |	Technically hard
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:04,959	| IOT176 |	Security concerns but it is something that everyone is going to have to
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,007	| IOT176 |	Carlos say
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:09,567	| IOT176 |	In a couple of weeks we will have actually someone
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:11,871	| IOT176 |	Bane on to talk a little bit more about this so you
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:15,711	| IOT176 |	Stay tuned for that in the meantime will include a link to the
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:17,503	| IOT176 |	Reports you can dig in on
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,271	| IOT176 |	Euro timing

EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,535	| IOT176 |	So Paul thank you so much for doing this
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,119	| IOT176 |	Play Love make
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:35,167	| IOT176 |	And this is for people who are building
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:36,447	| IOT176 |	Their own
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,983	| IOT176 |	Smart home systems and
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:39,519	| IOT176 |	Reddit homebridge on a pie
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:43,103	| IOT176 |	Will include a link to it some of its really easy
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:45,919	| IOT176 |	Hey all raspbian OS installed
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,711	| IOT176 |	Password for the default Pi use
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:48,991	| IOT176 |	You should change that
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:50,783	| IOT176 |	Another
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,343	| IOT176 |	Keep your OS up today
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,391	| IOT176 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,415	| IOT176 |	It's going to be secure
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,695	| IOT176 |	And some of these are a little bit more
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:00,767	| IOT176 |	So disable password login with
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:01,535	| IOT176 |	SSH
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:03,071	| IOT176 |	I was kind of like
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:05,119	| IOT176 |	That is not something that I thought about
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,959	| IOT176 |	Yeah I had to be honest
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:10,495	| IOT176 |	I hadn't thought about that
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,775	| IOT176 |	Nor have I thought
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:15,615	| IOT176 |	Or tried I should have thought about having tried setting up a firewall and
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:20,991	| IOT176 |	Punching a couple holes in specifically for devices I just haven't had the time to plan that out
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:21,759	| IOT176 |	Intuit
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:23,551	| IOT176 |	It does make sense
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:24,575	| IOT176 |	Yeah you're running a lot of pies
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:30,719	| IOT176 |	And so that's if you're going to make your own for all of the devices
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:34,303	| IOT176 |	Prayer things that are not your own device we talk about these all the time
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:36,095	| IOT176 |	Which is ya change your passwords
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:40,447	| IOT176 |	Keeping us up-to-date this goes a little further it says disabled services in protocols you don't
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:44,287	| IOT176 |	Sometimes you get in trouble when you're trying to do that individually on certain
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:45,567	| IOT176 |	Iot devices
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:47,359	| IOT176 |	So your device funk
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:47,871	| IOT176 |	Nationality Maybe
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,919	| IOT176 |	If you do that but
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:51,967	| IOT176 |	You know if you're using a VPN
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,247	| IOT176 |	Is also a lovely
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:57,855	| IOT176 |	It is and I don't think it's a bad solution but if you
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:02,975	| IOT176 |	Depending on how you implement a VPN and what you use like if you set your whole home
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:08,607	| IOT176 |	Internet off on a VPN and you do streaming services like if you watch MLB TV for example I watch
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:11,167	| IOT176 |	That's only available in the US so if I have a
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:16,031	| IOT176 |	Different IP address I from Canada I can't watch that service so there's pros and cons to that one
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:19,359	| IOT176 |	That's true and sometimes with automatic time update
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:22,175	| IOT176 |	If you're in a different view if your VPN saying you're in a different
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:22,943	| IOT176 |	Time zone U
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:25,503	| IOT176 |	You could have your lights wake you up an hour early witch
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:29,343	| IOT176 |	They also talk about things like using a guest Network
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,367	| IOT176 |	Talk about that
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:32,159	| IOT176 |	I don't love it I actually
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:34,207	| IOT176 |	Daycare is an Advertiser in the podcast
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:35,487	| IOT176 |	But while we were on the phone
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:37,023	| IOT176 |	Doing the ads
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,559	| IOT176 |	I did ask about the
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:39,071	| IOT176 |	This I was like
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:40,607	| IOT176 |	You know guest Networks
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:41,887	| IOT176 |	Don't work
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,655	| IOT176 |	Look for iot
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,727	| IOT176 |	Actually said that their work
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,775	| IOT176 |	To make easier
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,567	| IOT176 |	When that comes out
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:51,871	| IOT176 |	I don't know but it does give me
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:52,639	| IOT176 |	A sense of
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,407	| IOT176 |	Hope that
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:56,223	| IOT176 |	Maybe the Wi-Fi vendors are going to start taking this seriously
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:18:00,319	| IOT176 |	Create easier ways to do guest networks without actually doing
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,111	| IOT176 |	So
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:08,255	| IOT176 |	Let's move on thank you Paul for that everybody will include a link that actually offers some really good how to
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:09,279	| IOT176 |	Make magazine
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,071	| IOT176 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,351	| IOT176 |	Some quick new stuff shall we
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:13,887	| IOT176 |	We shall
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,655	| IOT176 |	Okay
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,679	| IOT176 |	Big news
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:21,311	| IOT176 |	On the show The June oven with Kevin and I both own and bought for 1495
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,871	| IOT176 |	And $95
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:27,711	| IOT176 |	That is no longer going to be the June
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:30,527	| IOT176 |	Gentoo oven that is out it is right now
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,295	| IOT176 |	499
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,319	| IOT176 |	9 for an undetermined
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,855	| IOT176 |	Period of time
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:37,183	| IOT176 |	Or you can buy gourmet package which is
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:40,255	| IOT176 |	699 and I can chew a bunch of trays
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,023	| IOT176 |	Recipe service
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:43,583	| IOT176 |	I think additional warranty services
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:46,143	| IOT176 |	Eventually the price of the
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:47,423	| IOT176 |	David will go up to 5
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,471	| IOT176 |	It hasn't yet
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,751	| IOT176 |	So we're going to talk
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:53,311	| IOT176 |	Much more about that but I just wanted to give you guys like
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:58,431	| IOT176 |	This is a smarter oven that we all know and love and if you don't know in love it it basically
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:00,991	| IOT176 |	Has a camera in it it recognizes your food
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:04,063	| IOT176 |	It has preset cooking programs it basically makes
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:04,575	| IOT176 |	Cooking
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:08,927	| IOT176 |	Yeah we still use ours
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,463	| IOT176 |	At least twice a day
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:10,975	| IOT176 |	If not more
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:16,095	| IOT176 |	Barely use a regular full-size oven as a result and it when I tell my wife about the shoes
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,631	| IOT176 |	I think we pay like $1,500
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,399	| IOT176 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:21,215	| IOT176 |	I said but you know what first-generation product relay doctors
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:23,775	| IOT176 |	That's life I said the question is do you feel it's worth
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:26,591	| IOT176 |	I just like yeah we use it all the time that's great
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:30,943	| IOT176 |	So she's not even upset about the price. I don't know if that's how you feel about it
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,967	| IOT176 |	You know it is what it is
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:34,271	| IOT176 |	You know I haven't talked to Matt
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:36,319	| IOT176 |	I feel okay about
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,343	| IOT176 |	I understand
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:38,367	| IOT176 |	We held
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:40,415	| IOT176 |	Kevin we helps make this possible
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,207	| IOT176 |	This is true
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:42,975	| IOT176 |	So
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,743	| IOT176 |	Look at us
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,767	| IOT176 |	If you guys buy it you can
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:50,143	| IOT176 |	Okay so arm has made
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:51,167	| IOT176 |	Acquisition
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:56,031	| IOT176 |	Last week but now it is a done deal arm his arm has a chip license
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,823	| IOT176 |	They bought a company
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:58,847	| IOT176 |	Called treasure
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:02,687	| IOT176 |	Data and the idea here is that arm
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,735	| IOT176 |	Seems to me they also bread
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:06,015	| IOT176 |	Company called stream
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:06,527	| IOT176 |	Data
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:10,623	| IOT176 |	Stop the stacks so instead of doing just
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:13,183	| IOT176 |	Semiconductor design and Licensing
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:14,719	| IOT176 |	They're starting to think about life
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:21,119	| IOT176 |	Black data processing in the closer you get to the solving the problem 1 it's going to have a good virtuous cycle on there
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:23,679	| IOT176 |	Chip designs are going to understand what they need to build
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,215	| IOT176 |	More butt
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:26,239	| IOT176 |	They also
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:29,823	| IOT176 |	But this was not a lot of people are using it but they also launched a cloud service
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,359	| IOT176 |	Especially I think
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:33,919	| IOT176 |	2 years ago so it kind of makes sense
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:34,431	| IOT176 |	Sit there
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,735	| IOT176 |	Getting more into Data Manager
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:38,271	| IOT176 |	Spencer treasure data does data management
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:44,159	| IOT176 |	Pulling data from a bunch of iot devices and they help you
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:44,927	| IOT176 |	Normalize it
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,487	| IOT176 |	So you know
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:50,559	| IOT176 |	Since it is also adds another Revenue stream for arm
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,327	| IOT176 |	And that
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:53,887	| IOT176 |	With treasure data for the data analytics and
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:57,471	| IOT176 |	Stream Technologies and arm and bed people who subscribe
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:58,495	| IOT176 |	Forest Service
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,263	| IOT176 |	Through those
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:00,031	| IOT176 |	Entities
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:05,407	| IOT176 |	Will be able management take devices over the clouds so that's a whole new Revenue potential stream for the
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:06,943	| IOT176 |	Oh that's true
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:08,735	| IOT176 |	All right so that's the arm news
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:16,159	| IOT176 |	Any smart home news we have a fridge cam coming out from a company in the UK called smarter
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:18,464	| IOT176 |	Here in the US I don't believe we could order it yet
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:20,768	| IOT176 |	Very disappointed I saw this at CES
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,560	| IOT176 |	How do you know if it was last year if it was 27
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:23,840	| IOT176 |	But
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:24,864	| IOT176 |	If you're in the UK
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,400	| IOT176 |	You can buy it for
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,472	| IOT176 |	You can buy it for a hundred and fifty pounds
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:32,032	| IOT176 |	Or roughly a hundred pound
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:32,800	| IOT176 |	If you buy a
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,824	| IOT176 |	Fridge
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:38,432	| IOT176 |	I love this because it is a camera you stick in your fridge that also has
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:39,712	| IOT176 |	AI is part of it
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:41,248	| IOT176 |	They're working with
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:42,528	| IOT176 |	UK grocer test
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:44,576	| IOT176 |	Costco so you can
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:46,624	| IOT176 |	Get a shopping list based on your
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,904	| IOT176 |	Fridge contents
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:49,696	| IOT176 |	And they send that to Tesco and
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,208	| IOT176 |	Jessica will just
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:51,232	| IOT176 |	Chocolate
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:54,048	| IOT176 |	Pick it up I just really want to be able to open
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:54,560	| IOT176 |	My free agency
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,608	| IOT176 |	I can't open my
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,632	| IOT176 |	Message and see what's inside
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:22:01,216	| IOT176 |	I want to be able to get a picture of what's in my fridge so I can
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:05,312	| IOT176 |	I just want to see if the light really goes off
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,336	| IOT176 |	It does
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,640	| IOT176 |	How do you know
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:12,736	| IOT176 |	Okay so let's see what else do I
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:15,296	| IOT176 |	Kevin I can't believe we almost didn't talk about this
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:17,088	| IOT176 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,368	| IOT176 |	Anki vector
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:23,232	| IOT176 |	Oh yes the Anki Vector which was announced earlier this week
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:28,864	| IOT176 |	For those who are not familiar maybe you are familiar with the cozmo also made by Anki that
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:33,728	| IOT176 |	That came out I believe in 2016 if that's small little robot is small
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:39,104	| IOT176 |	Sister I don't know 2 or 3 in wide by maybe three maybe four in long is smallfoot
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:42,432	| IOT176 |	It is the cutest little thing I know it's Stacy you love the
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:44,224	| IOT176 |	The cosmo personality
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:45,760	| IOT176 |	So wonderful
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:50,368	| IOT176 |	It's so endearing that funky I met with them to talk about the new
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:52,928	| IOT176 |	Devices called Vector they said that people
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:55,232	| IOT176 |	Sending you know there
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:58,304	| IOT176 |	I'm sending their Cosmo because it needs me up some maybe something broke on it
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,328	| IOT176 |	Plastic parts
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:00,352	| IOT176 |	Do I get it fixed
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:03,168	| IOT176 |	And they're like my nephew is miserable at his
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:09,568	| IOT176 |	Cosmo had to come back and please hurry and people get really attached to this because aside from it
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:11,616	| IOT176 |	Being just at home robot it's really
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,640	| IOT176 |	A companion
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:17,248	| IOT176 |	So much so that onky has hired somebody from Pixar and they animate
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:19,552	| IOT176 |	Thousands of expressions and movements in
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,576	| IOT176 |	It just didn't
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:25,696	| IOT176 |	Those into the robot it's really like a little personality on tread spray
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:29,536	| IOT176 |	It is and it actually so when you are games you play with
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:30,816	| IOT176 |	Cosmo
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:32,608	| IOT176 |	We'll talk about the old one
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:34,912	| IOT176 |	The old one and what it would lose
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:36,192	| IOT176 |	Was too many times in a row
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,984	| IOT176 |	It would get mad it would like
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:41,312	| IOT176 |	Jamis little it has like a little bulldozer front and we just go
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:44,640	| IOT176 |	To beat it on the floor and it was
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:46,176	| IOT176 |	I mean it was kind of hilarious but
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,200	| IOT176 |	Also
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,224	| IOT176 |	Just so much
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:50,528	| IOT176 |	Okay facts about yourself
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:52,320	| IOT176 |	Vector looks a lot like
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:58,720	| IOT176 |	Cosmo very very similar maybe even identical it's hard to say exactly I know that they've doubled the amount of parts inside
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:00,768	| IOT176 |	Lights on the inside cefaly different
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:03,072	| IOT176 |	Back on the inside is very different because with
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:05,120	| IOT176 |	Cosmo you had to connect
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:07,936	| IOT176 |	Chi robot via an app on your phone or tablet and
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,216	| IOT176 |	A lot of the processing
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:14,080	| IOT176 |	Was actually done on the phone or the tablet that big difference with Vector is
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:17,408	| IOT176 |	It's all on board and when I say all
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,432	| IOT176 |	Division is on board
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:21,504	| IOT176 |	The neural network is on board
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:25,088	| IOT176 |	The mapping is on board natural language processing is on board
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:29,184	| IOT176 |	It does have a connection to the cloud over your Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:32,000	| IOT176 |	And that is to access its Knowledge Graph
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:36,864	| IOT176 |	Companies such as Google Amazon have knowledge graphs that their devices tap into for information
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:39,680	| IOT176 |	Well Vector does the same only its monkeys knowledge
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,728	| IOT176 |	It moves just like
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,008	| IOT176 |	The old robots
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:45,568	| IOT176 |	It actually can tell when it's
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:48,640	| IOT176 |	Battery is running low to like 10 15%
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:50,176	| IOT176 |	And it will go back
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:52,736	| IOT176 |	By itself autonomously to its little charging base
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:57,344	| IOT176 |	I asked them about that makes so you can only use it when it's off the base right
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,624	| IOT176 |	They said no actually
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:01,440	| IOT176 |	Once the battery runs out goes back on his charger
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:03,744	| IOT176 |	He still available to listen speak
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:07,584	| IOT176 |	Ask for information give you the weather will still recognize faces
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,352	| IOT176 |	It's just that
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:11,168	| IOT176 |	If you do any movement with a Treads those suck up a lot of juice
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:11,936	| IOT176 |	And he may not
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:16,544	| IOT176 |	Come out of his charging pad if you say go across to the front window and tell me who's outside he won't do that
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,592	| IOT176 |	There's person recognition
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,384	| IOT176 |	And there's the everything in there is
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,664	| IOT176 |	All on board
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:26,784	| IOT176 |	Running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip and it's a reasonable price the
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:31,392	| IOT176 |	Cosmo device was 179 this is on Kickstarter
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:33,440	| IOT176 |	You could have until September 6th
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,208	| IOT176 |	Tobacco
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:38,304	| IOT176 |	It is 199 is the early bird but when it hits stores in October
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,584	| IOT176 |	It will be 249
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:42,912	| IOT176 |	Even so yes it's a small little thing is not going to lift
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:46,240	| IOT176 |	Picked up things on your house to bring them to you per se but there's so much
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:52,128	| IOT176 |	Groundbreaking intelligence in this for the price in my opinion that that's why I thought that's what you were talking about
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:53,408	| IOT176 |	And
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:53,920	| IOT176 |	Are you going to buy one
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:57,504	| IOT176 |	I am seriously considering I have till September 6
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:59,552	| IOT176 |	The early backers will get there
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:03,904	| IOT176 |	Vector by October 9th it will hit retail stores buy a
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:04,672	| IOT176 |	October 12th
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:08,256	| IOT176 |	There is an SDK that if you know some python
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:10,048	| IOT176 |	You can program it yourself
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:13,120	| IOT176 |	That comes out in December and that's kind of why I'm interested
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:16,192	| IOT176 |	Just how much is onboard as well as the SDK because
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:21,312	| IOT176 |	What got me interested in talking in general was I saw a video of somebody using a cosmo
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:25,664	| IOT176 |	Pairing up with Google tensorflow and training it to recognize the difference between a cat
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,432	| IOT176 |	A dog and
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:30,272	| IOT176 |	Assure example and there another Cosmo go around and say cat
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:36,672	| IOT176 |	Dog cat networks go to the shoe and he would someone directly saw shoe and to me that's fun tinkering and that's what I'd like
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:38,208	| IOT176 |	I'm leaning towards yes getting on
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,768	| IOT176 |	Okay
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:42,304	| IOT176 |	Well then you'll have to send me my Cosmo
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:45,120	| IOT176 |	Okay
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:48,192	| IOT176 |	Two other quick bits of news the FBI is warning
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:53,056	| IOT176 |	Hospitals that their iot devices are being targeted by cybercriminals
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:55,104	| IOT176 |	This is not surprising we've been talking about it
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:57,920	| IOT176 |	Sears now but
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,968	| IOT176 |	The FBI's finally Lake.
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:02,016	| IOT176 |	Reboot your devices
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:03,552	| IOT176 |	They talked about using antivirus
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:07,136	| IOT176 |	Isolate your iot devices from other network connection
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:08,416	| IOT176 |	Basic secure
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:10,464	| IOT176 |	The other piece of news
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,744	| IOT176 |	It's worth talking about just
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:16,352	| IOT176 |	Because we wrote about it in the newsletter but we haven't talked about it is Charlie Kindle
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,120	| IOT176 |	The guy behind
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:19,168	| IOT176 |	Madam is Smart Home
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:19,936	| IOT176 |	Efforts
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:20,960	| IOT176 |	He's now at
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:21,984	| IOT176 |	Control4
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,776	| IOT176 |	Which is a
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:25,312	| IOT176 |	Professionally installed
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:27,360	| IOT176 |	Home automation
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:28,896	| IOT176 |	ABK
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:32,736	| IOT176 |	So I was really excited I talked to Charlie about this
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:37,856	| IOT176 |	And one big takeaway and you can see the interview on the website but the one they take away I thought was interesting
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:39,136	| IOT176 |	When I asked him
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:42,208	| IOT176 |	Why go to professional when you've been DIY your whole life
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:43,744	| IOT176 |	And he was like
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:45,792	| IOT176 |	Look there's just a bunch of stuff that
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:49,120	| IOT176 |	It's just too complicated for consumers that you just can't do
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:49,632	| IOT176 |	If you
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:51,936	| IOT176 |	Are trying to do DIY so like
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,728	| IOT176 |	Whole home audio
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,008	| IOT176 |	Video of those kind
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,288	| IOT176 |	I just really difficult
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:59,104	| IOT176 |	And I appreciate what he said about
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,640	| IOT176 |	The fact that both
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:02,176	| IOT176 |	DIY and
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:03,968	| IOT176 |	Professional Home install
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:05,248	| IOT176 |	There's a place for both
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,272	| IOT176 |	In this world in it
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:09,344	| IOT176 |	You know what I think he's right we focus a lot on DIY stuff
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:11,648	| IOT176 |	But you know what we'd do this stuff we
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,160	| IOT176 |	Elizabeth
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:13,952	| IOT176 |	A lot of people are like
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:17,536	| IOT176 |	I have no idea where to start and I wouldn't even know how to install it
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:19,328	| IOT176 |	So yeah there's definitely
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:19,840	| IOT176 |	Placerville
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:22,656	| IOT176 |	Oh yeah and then the second thing he said
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:25,216	| IOT176 |	That was worth noting is I asked him
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:26,240	| IOT176 |	What kind of
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:27,520	| IOT176 |	Technologies he was
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:29,824	| IOT176 |	Excited about still where the future was still going
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,360	| IOT176 |	In
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,384	| IOT176 |	One of his
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:35,968	| IOT176 |	Topix was voice not recite we got a lot of room to run there
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:36,736	| IOT176 |	Not surprised
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,296	| IOT176 |	But the second was actually high quality content
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:40,576	| IOT176 |	So we pulled out he's like
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:41,088	| IOT176 |	You know
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:42,368	| IOT176 |	Kind of sucked
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,392	| IOT176 |	Petco dachshund
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:46,976	| IOT176 |	Compression Technologies for audio and video for a while in the
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:47,744	| IOT176 |	Experience has it
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:49,792	| IOT176 |	Shipping crate so he's looking at things like for Katie
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:51,328	| IOT176 |	TV better audio codec
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:53,376	| IOT176 |	And he thinks that's going to actually make a big comeback
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:54,656	| IOT176 |	So
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:58,496	| IOT176 |	Maybe I mean my daughter would rather watch something on
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,544	| IOT176 |	YouTube and
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:01,824	| IOT176 |	Stream
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:05,408	| IOT176 |	Her Spotify list through the echo so this is not a
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,688	| IOT176 |	High quality experience
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,528	| IOT176 |	Enough about
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:11,296	| IOT176 |	News

EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,880	| IOT176 |	Alright this week's voicemail is from
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:47,904	| IOT176 |	Noah
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:48,928	| IOT176 |	Big eyes
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:51,744	| IOT176 |	I was wondering if
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:53,280	| IOT176 |	You know what a federal
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,560	| IOT176 |	It is too large
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:55,328	| IOT176 |	Harmony is
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:57,888	| IOT176 |	Use it or automating a lot of
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,472	| IOT176 |	Like
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:03,520	| IOT176 |	And then air purifiers my
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:05,312	| IOT176 |	Old school
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,616	| IOT176 |	TV and I really don't want one anyway
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:09,152	| IOT176 |	Irregardless
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:10,176	| IOT176 |	Yes
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:14,016	| IOT176 |	Like how it's based on profiles and I have to turn one profile
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:15,040	| IOT176 |	Before I can
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:16,320	| IOT176 |	Another one
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:18,368	| IOT176 |	On it gets really messy when I have more
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,416	| IOT176 |	Places that I want to start
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:21,696	| IOT176 |	Or stop at 1
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:24,000	| IOT176 |	So if there's anything that you guys can see
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:25,280	| IOT176 |	Think of or know of
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:26,560	| IOT176 |	Thanks
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:30,144	| IOT176 |	Big props to you for using
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:31,168	| IOT176 |	What I would think
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:34,496	| IOT176 |	Unconventional technology for this particular use
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:37,312	| IOT176 |	I our lives like I was like
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,896	| IOT176 |	Instead of a Logitech Harmony he should go with the
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:41,664	| IOT176 |	Amazon
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:46,016	| IOT176 |	New Kindle block thing this out but then I listened to your voicemail and I was like oh no
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:46,528	| IOT176 |	No not freaking
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,064	| IOT176 |	Ceiling fans
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:50,368	| IOT176 |	Instead I'm going to direct you to
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:55,232	| IOT176 |	A device that I was really excited about probably really last year but
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:57,280	| IOT176 |	I'm not as excited about now but
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:31:00,096	| IOT176 |	It's perfect for what you want this is a device called the bond
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:03,168	| IOT176 |	It is
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:07,776	| IOT176 |	Is a $99 disc that basically uses Wi-Fi IR
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:09,056	| IOT176 |	And has RF
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:13,408	| IOT176 |	Capabilities so it will pair with your ceiling fans existing remote
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:14,944	| IOT176 |	Control up to
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:15,456	| IOT176 |	6 ceiling
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:16,736	| IOT176 |	Score
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,760	| IOT176 |	Six devices
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:19,296	| IOT176 |	It also works with fireplaces
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:22,112	| IOT176 |	The idea is
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:22,880	| IOT176 |	That you
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,928	| IOT176 |	Lincoln to this device
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:27,744	| IOT176 |	And then you can control it via Madam a or if
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:29,024	| IOT176 |	Or
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,560	| IOT176 |	Dap the bond app
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:33,120	| IOT176 |	And you don't have to put in like the fancy
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:37,216	| IOT176 |	Retrofit kits for an existing ceiling fan or replace your entire ceiling fan
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:38,496	| IOT176 |	So you know
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:43,360	| IOT176 |	I don't know it works people seem to really like it I hadn't tried it I was excited when they
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,384	| IOT176 |	Started initially.
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:45,408	| IOT176 |	Talking about it because
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:47,712	| IOT176 |	They said it was going to do more than just
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:50,016	| IOT176 |	Ir and RF they were going to do other
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,040	| IOT176 |	Radio frequencies
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:53,856	| IOT176 |	And I wanted to pair it to my somfy blinds app
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:54,624	| IOT176 |	Patozon
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:55,392	| IOT176 |	Cuz I hate my
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:56,672	| IOT176 |	My current some people I knew
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:57,696	| IOT176 |	Cementation butt
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,720	| IOT176 |	It doesn't have that yet
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:31:59,488	| IOT176 |	So I am sad
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:04,096	| IOT176 |	Yeah they are looking at bringing support to other devices as well though I say
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:05,632	| IOT176 |	Think like garage doors and some others
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:08,192	| IOT176 |	Yes they are right now they only have ceiling
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:09,728	| IOT176 |	What's in my hunches
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:13,312	| IOT176 |	Be on or off
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:17,152	| IOT176 |	You do need for an IRA if your fans are IRA
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:19,456	| IOT176 |	Not RF you're going to have to make sure the bond
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:22,016	| IOT176 |	Has a clear line of sight to the fan
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:23,808	| IOT176 |	Which means it's not gonna be able to
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:24,576	| IOT176 |	Troll
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,344	| IOT176 |	IR fans
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:28,416	| IOT176 |	So that's one thing to know
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:30,464	| IOT176 |	But it's relatively cheap
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:32,256	| IOT176 |	If you
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:34,816	| IOT176 |	Could use it for a couple things then
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:35,584	| IOT176 |	Crate
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:37,120	| IOT176 |	Ceiling fans
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:42,496	| IOT176 |	Controlled by Lutron on off switch so I can actually control the speed this will let you control speeds if you have the speed
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,264	| IOT176 |	With the remote
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:44,288	| IOT176 |	So yeah
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,056	| IOT176 |	99 bucks
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:51,456	| IOT176 |	And that about wraps up the show this week please stay tuned for our guest

EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:09,536	| IOT176 |	To make the cloud
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:11,072	| IOT176 |	Connectivity work at
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:12,096	| IOT176 |	It's a terrible
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:13,888	| IOT176 |	Formula that's going to end bad
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:16,960	| IOT176 |	And so that's why when we designed inside
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:19,008	| IOT176 |	We did it from the ground up to be
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:20,800	| IOT176 |	Self Deployable
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:21,824	| IOT176 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:27,200	| IOT176 |	Secure what we did was we drew on the same technology we've been using for our readiness
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:29,248	| IOT176 |	Ready Cloud Solutions the last
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:33,856	| IOT176 |	Six seven years it's the same architecture we use with Arlo cameras
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:34,880	| IOT176 |	So that means there's
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:35,648	| IOT176 |	Literally
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:37,440	| IOT176 |	4 million of these agents
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:43,584	| IOT176 |	Purely running day-in-and-day-out to buy choosing an architecture which was already
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:45,120	| IOT176 |	Simple little boy abs
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:46,400	| IOT176 |	Absolutely robot
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:47,168	| IOT176 |	And time test
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:49,216	| IOT176 |	We knew that we would get in
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:51,776	| IOT176 |	Experience for customers wouldn't be compromised
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:52,288	| IOT176 |	Which is on
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:56,640	| IOT176 |	And you guys have notifications or maybe some sort of
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:59,712	| IOT176 |	Machine learning that understands when bad things enter the network
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:02,528	| IOT176 |	Absolutely and that's one of the
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:04,576	| IOT176 |	Neat things about Cloud connected
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:05,344	| IOT176 |	Devices
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:06,624	| IOT176 |	It's because what that does is
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:09,184	| IOT176 |	Is create a very close relationship
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:10,464	| IOT176 |	Between our customers
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,232	| IOT176 |	And that's your
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:14,560	| IOT176 |	So we can do a couple of different things for you one is
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:17,120	| IOT176 |	We make it very easy if you ever need help
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:18,656	| IOT176 |	Support with your device
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:21,984	| IOT176 |	Forget that we also can immediately alert you if
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:24,544	| IOT176 |	Through our network of paid hackers
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:25,824	| IOT176 |	White hat hacker
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:29,664	| IOT176 |	Hurst if we find a defect we can mediately let you know that there's a
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:31,200	| IOT176 |	Problems and help you get it
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:32,992	| IOT176 |	And of course customers
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:35,040	| IOT176 |	Set notifications and alerts
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:41,440	| IOT176 |	To know what's going on in their Network and the message goes right to the phone in their pocket wherever they happen to be
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:41,952	| IOT176 |	Anytime
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:44,768	| IOT176 |	Subscription for this
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:48,864	| IOT176 |	What we do is we provide you a to base level connection
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:52,704	| IOT176 |	Devices anywhere in the world you get the ability
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:53,728	| IOT176 |	To do all this
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:59,872	| IOT176 |	Cool stuff if you scale beyond that if you're starting to get to a bigger Network we do charge a nominal fee uniform
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:05,248	| IOT176 |	Check connectivity gets $5 a year per device that's more realistic
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:06,272	| IOT176 |	Continue to invest
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:08,832	| IOT176 |	The infrastructure and make sure that it's a rich

EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:50,720	| IOT176 |	And I'm ashamed to say since I was such an early and
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:53,280	| IOT176 |	Enthusiastic a doctor that you have and I still have not tried the
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:55,072	| IOT176 |	Terrible
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:57,888	| IOT176 |	Free trial
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:58,656	| IOT176 |	Let's
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:37:59,680	| IOT176 |	Kick it off with
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:00,448	| IOT176 |	Men
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:01,472	| IOT176 |	I really want to know we should
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:02,752	| IOT176 |	How
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:03,520	| IOT176 |	House
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:04,288	| IOT176 |	Did you cut this
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:04,800	| IOT176 |	Greystone
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:06,336	| IOT176 |	So much
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:10,432	| IOT176 |	Kevin and I beforehand we're looking at this it looks like there's no scale in here
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:11,456	| IOT176 |	It looks like they're still the
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:13,504	| IOT176 |	Computer vision aspect of it
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:15,040	| IOT176 |	Looks like there may not be enough
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:16,576	| IOT176 |	Break it down for me
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:19,136	| IOT176 |	How did you go from 1495
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:20,160	| IOT176 |	2 499
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:21,952	| IOT176 |	Lots of little things
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:24,000	| IOT176 |	Is the best way to describe it
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:25,280	| IOT176 |	Particular examples
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:27,072	| IOT176 |	So one of the really nice things
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:28,352	| IOT176 |	For all of our customer
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:29,376	| IOT176 |	Where is that
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:31,424	| IOT176 |	90%
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:33,984	| IOT176 |	We're able to learn usage pattern
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:36,288	| IOT176 |	Figure out what the most important teachers are on the tree
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:38,336	| IOT176 |	So for example
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:39,360	| IOT176 |	Our automated
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:40,128	| IOT176 |	Cook programs
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:43,456	| IOT176 |	With Summer by the Cameron some U2 summer menu
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:46,016	| IOT176 |	Those make up 42% of all cook session
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,576	| IOT176 |	Single largest
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:49,344	| IOT176 |	Whale
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:50,624	| IOT176 |	Not to people cooking
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:51,904	| IOT176 |	Is by using
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:52,672	| IOT176 |	Are automatic
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:54,208	| IOT176 |	And so
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:55,488	| IOT176 |	When we can
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:57,024	| IOT176 |	Dug into that a little more
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:59,840	| IOT176 |	We thought about when you were the most important aspects of that and
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:01,376	| IOT176 |	Two of those aspects are
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:05,984	| IOT176 |	Able to do Oliver
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:06,496	| IOT176 |	Automatically
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:08,288	| IOT176 |	No preheat
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:09,568	| IOT176 |	And so are coming
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:12,128	| IOT176 |	That's one area where
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:14,176	| IOT176 |	Easily could have saved a lot of cost and
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:15,200	| IOT176 |	Decided not to
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:15,968	| IOT176 |	Based off of
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:18,272	| IOT176 |	And then
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:23,392	| IOT176 |	Camera another easy ways to take money off of our bill of materials are bomb and again
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:24,160	| IOT176 |	Very important
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:25,440	| IOT176 |	Feature to shortcut.
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:26,720	| IOT176 |	Access record program
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:28,256	| IOT176 |	And so we have that.
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:28,768	| IOT176 |	Those were not
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:30,304	| IOT176 |	Good things
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:33,120	| IOT176 |	Save money on and then we started looking for other place
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:34,912	| IOT176 |	And so one of those places
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:36,192	| IOT176 |	A weight scale
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:37,216	| IOT176 |	Report load cells
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:41,056	| IOT176 |	And we're able to look at the data
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:41,824	| IOT176 |	And see how often
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:43,872	| IOT176 |	People were actually wearing their food
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:47,456	| IOT176 |	Some people that do it a lot
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:48,480	| IOT176 |	The majority people
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:50,016	| IOT176 |	Never ever use that feature
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:50,784	| IOT176 |	And
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:53,600	| IOT176 |	So why should we have our customers
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:54,624	| IOT176 |	Have to pay it
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:55,648	| IOT176 |	That Hardware
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:39:57,696	| IOT176 |	The future that is not very used
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:40:00,256	| IOT176 |	And so we were able to actually use data on usage pattern
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:02,560	| IOT176 |	Figure out that that was an okay teacher
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:04,352	| IOT176 |	You're too removed from the product
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:05,632	| IOT176 |	Wait so I thought
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:08,704	| IOT176 |	Oven automatically
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:09,984	| IOT176 |	The cooking time
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:12,288	| IOT176 |	Haven't use weight as one
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,312	| IOT176 |	Variables
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,616	| IOT176 |	It would be a more
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:19,712	| IOT176 |	Valuable sensor that actually was that we would one day use it as
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:20,736	| IOT176 |	Of value to
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:21,760	| IOT176 |	Adjust cook Bergen
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:22,784	| IOT176 |	Fractions
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:24,576	| IOT176 |	I always thought you did
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:26,880	| IOT176 |	Colour Me surprised
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:29,184	| IOT176 |	I use it every time
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:30,208	| IOT176 |	It's automatically doing it
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:33,792	| IOT176 |	Temperature in the different temperature sensor
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:38,912	| IOT176 |	Okay so
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:39,680	| IOT176 |	You took out the scale
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:40,704	| IOT176 |	What else did you
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:43,008	| IOT176 |	That's one area to another area
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:43,520	| IOT176 |	That
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:45,824	| IOT176 |	Great opportunity save a lot of money
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:48,128	| IOT176 |	Can I lower quality
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:49,408	| IOT176 |	Display
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:50,688	| IOT176 |	Touchscreen work
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,456	| IOT176 |	Computer
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:52,224	| IOT176 |	Empress
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:54,016	| IOT176 |	I got her homework and
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:55,808	| IOT176 |	That was not the place to cut corners
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:57,088	| IOT176 |	And so we still have a
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:41:00,928	| IOT176 |	2.3 gigahertz quad-core computer on the June oven
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:03,744	| IOT176 |	An area that we did see that people were using
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:05,792	| IOT176 |	As the primary method
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:08,096	| IOT176 |	Communicating with their June oven
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:09,376	| IOT176 |	Versus using the knob
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:10,912	| IOT176 |	And so even though we were
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:13,984	| IOT176 |	The feature that
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:14,752	| IOT176 |	Weatherford fire
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:20,896	| IOT176 |	Gentoo does not have a knob on the front it's just a touch screen
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:21,664	| IOT176 |	But you can also
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:22,944	| IOT176 |	Control your voice using Alexa
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:25,760	| IOT176 |	Okay so that feels super controversial to me
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:28,064	| IOT176 |	Maybe because I'm old and I do use the
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:29,344	| IOT176 |	I like having that
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:30,112	| IOT176 |	Interface
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:33,696	| IOT176 |	Because it makes me feel like the oven will still work even if the
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:34,976	| IOT176 |	Touch screen goes kerplunk
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:37,280	| IOT176 |	And is that just me kidding myself
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:38,816	| IOT176 |	I mean if the computer goes coupon
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:42,912	| IOT176 |	True okay
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:47,264	| IOT176 |	Limited edition original
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:51,616	| IOT176 |	So you can brag call your friends and one of the amazing things also about softer
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:53,919	| IOT176 |	So you've been
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:56,735	| IOT176 |	With a lot of features that
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:58,015	| IOT176 |	I barely got any press
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:42:00,063	| IOT176 |	I'm getting a lot of press on today as
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:02,879	| IOT176 |	New June Gentoo features but in reality
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:03,903	| IOT176 |	Same operating
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:06,719	| IOT176 |	Platform so you've been
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:09,535	| IOT176 |	Getting all these features over the last year-and-a-half
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:11,071	| IOT176 |	Her free just as
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:11,839	| IOT176 |	Software update
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:14,655	| IOT176 |	Our new customers will get to experience all those as
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:16,191	| IOT176 |	I love their intro to Judy
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:18,239	| IOT176 |	Overwhelming
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:18,751	| IOT176 |	It kind of feels like
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:21,823	| IOT176 |	I don't know what to do with that
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:23,103	| IOT176 |	No I love my
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:26,175	| IOT176 |	Okay let's go back to cutting
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:26,687	| IOT176 |	Cost
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,479	| IOT176 |	Scale knob
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:29,247	| IOT176 |	What other things
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:34,879	| IOT176 |	The primary features from other areas there is a lot of simplification
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:36,159	| IOT176 |	Designs
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:38,463	| IOT176 |	So taking everything that we've learned from
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:39,231	| IOT176 |	How to make a
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:40,255	| IOT176 |	June oven in gen 1
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:41,791	| IOT176 |	What type of
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:43,327	| IOT176 |	Decisions can we make
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:46,399	| IOT176 |	On the second generation
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:47,423	| IOT176 |	There are
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:48,191	| IOT176 |	3
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:50,239	| IOT176 |	Variables and you only get two
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:51,519	| IOT176 |	Focus on two of them
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:52,287	| IOT176 |	So
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:53,567	| IOT176 |	All those variables
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:54,335	| IOT176 |	Quality
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:55,615	| IOT176 |	Quality of the product
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:56,639	| IOT176 |	The Nexus calling
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:57,663	| IOT176 |	What time so
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:42:59,967	| IOT176 |	Crunch to ship
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:01,503	| IOT176 |	We should go first June oven
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:02,015	| IOT176 |	Literally on
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:03,807	| IOT176 |	And then the
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:06,879	| IOT176 |	Would be cost
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:08,415	| IOT176 |	And so on
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:10,207	| IOT176 |	1st June oven we optimized
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:11,999	| IOT176 |	Quality Inn
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:12,767	| IOT176 |	Speed to Market
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:13,535	| IOT176 |	And
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:14,047	| IOT176 |	But this time
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:15,839	| IOT176 |	Basic qualities
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:17,375	| IOT176 |	List of most important thing
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:20,703	| IOT176 |	But we Orient ourselves and knew the importance
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:22,495	| IOT176 |	Getting a more accessible price point
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:25,567	| IOT176 |	And so we made sure to build that in
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:27,871	| IOT176 |	The shipment ready
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:30,687	| IOT176 |	Excellent let's talk about the plans for
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:35,551	| IOT176 |	June going forward I was always intrigued by you guys because
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:36,319	| IOT176 |	You built this
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:38,879	| IOT176 |	Product it was arguably smart it wasn't just connect
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:40,415	| IOT176 |	It was actually smart
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:42,207	| IOT176 |	I really appreciate it
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:46,047	| IOT176 |	Since I see lots of terrible connected stuff but it was expensive I was I
EDL	00:43:46,047	00:43:48,351	| IOT176 |	Constantly asking you about your business models
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:50,655	| IOT176 |	And I paid for upgrades in the form of
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:53,215	| IOT176 |	I bought an air fryer tray
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:56,543	| IOT176 |	Gourmet package
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:01,407	| IOT176 |	You know what felt like you guys had an interesting
EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:02,431	| IOT176 |	I don't know if it's
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:03,967	| IOT176 |	Stainable or not model
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:06,271	| IOT176 |	Also adding a new lower price
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:08,319	| IOT176 |	What does that say about
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:10,879	| IOT176 |	What the business models are anticipating going with
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:12,415	| IOT176 |	For the next however long it takes
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:13,439	| IOT176 |	Where does the
EDL	00:44:14,719	00:44:18,815	| IOT176 |	From our perspective
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:21,119	| IOT176 |	The most important thing
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:23,167	| IOT176 |	To the last business I was involved in
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:24,191	| IOT176 |	Focused on
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:25,215	| IOT176 |	Getting lots of
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:27,775	| IOT176 |	Musers that we didn't sell a product what was the social networking
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:30,591	| IOT176 |	Social news site
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:32,895	| IOT176 |	The general idea was get lots of eyeballs
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:34,687	| IOT176 |	Figure out how to monetize it later
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:36,991	| IOT176 |	Work together
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:38,015	| IOT176 |	The Social Network
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:40,319	| IOT176 |	That's what I think that we can like about that business model
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:41,599	| IOT176 |	Because in that world
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:43,135	| IOT176 |	You can only have two masters
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:44,927	| IOT176 |	You deserve customers are you sure
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:49,023	| IOT176 |	People keeping the lights on so and usually that you know what the advertiser
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:51,583	| IOT176 |	And so for us we want to be able to surf
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:55,679	| IOT176 |	We want to make a product that's high quality that's worth paying for
EDL	00:44:57,471	00:45:00,031	| IOT176 |	That was the one requirement
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:00,543	| IOT176 |	When we were
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:04,639	| IOT176 |	Work together before we even that decided
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:06,687	| IOT176 |	We wanted to make something that was
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:09,503	| IOT176 |	HEB business
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:13,599	| IOT176 |	But that is hard and I say this not to be a jerk but
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:16,671	| IOT176 |	Because even things like Roku which sells Hardware also
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:21,023	| IOT176 |	Most of their money on advertising and you look at the fate of like GoPro and Fitbit
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:23,583	| IOT176 |	I'm thinking everyone points to Apple with nuts
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:24,607	| IOT176 |	Great place to be
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:29,471	| IOT176 |	It's really hard to be a
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:34,079	| IOT176 |	So
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:38,175	| IOT176 |	Should I expect you guys I mean are you sustainable just as selling this product
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:40,735	| IOT176 |	For the rest of your life do you plan to Branch out into other
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:43,551	| IOT176 |	Kitchen products I know a lot of companies are now looking at
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:49,439	| IOT176 |	Trying to talk about a hard business. Sounds like a really hard business
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:49,951	| IOT176 |	Every few weeks
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:56,863	| IOT176 |	From our perspective would focus on
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:45:58,655	| IOT176 |	We have
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:45:59,679	| IOT176 |	Relied on that in the past
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:02,239	| IOT176 |	Look for today when we're not relying on that
EDL	00:46:02,751	00:46:04,543	| IOT176 |	That's a big part of taking a risk
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:07,871	| IOT176 |	Company like June to be able to ring
EDL	00:46:07,871	00:46:09,919	| IOT176 |	A product like the June intelligent oven to Market
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:12,991	| IOT176 |	Bring a lot about your first shareholders
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:13,503	| IOT176 |	Great product
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:18,367	| IOT176 |	Let's flip to your subscription business
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:22,719	| IOT176 |	Because you guys launched the recipes tell us a little bit about recipe
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:25,023	| IOT176 |	Is how that's going
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:26,559	| IOT176 |	Herzing to try
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:28,863	| IOT176 |	Chicken eaters
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:30,143	| IOT176 |	Nope you need to work on
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:31,679	| IOT176 |	Cuz I want the feedback
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:33,471	| IOT176 |	Walkthrough
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:36,543	| IOT176 |	Can I was out there
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:38,079	| IOT176 |	And the most part
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:40,127	| IOT176 |	Recipes online are YouTube videos in
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:40,895	| IOT176 |	X-Files
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:41,919	| IOT176 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:44,479	| IOT176 |	Get some fun
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:48,575	| IOT176 |	Tasty or something like that but we didn't see any experience out there that
EDL	00:46:48,575	00:46:49,599	| IOT176 |	Was actually
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:50,111	| IOT176 |	Guided
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:52,159	| IOT176 |	Dress we have
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:53,695	| IOT176 |	This opportunity
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:54,975	| IOT176 |	Do guided cooking
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:46:56,767	| IOT176 |	While also having
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:46:57,791	| IOT176 |	All the right hooks
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:46:59,327	| IOT176 |	Into this
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:02,399	| IOT176 |	Enso

EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:11,103	| IOT176 |	And you're doing a program where
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:12,895	| IOT176 |	Teaching you how to perfectly dressed up
EDL	00:47:14,431	00:47:15,967	| IOT176 |	Your iPhone or iPad
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:17,503	| IOT176 |	We ask you how you like your salmon
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:18,783	| IOT176 |	And I wish you remember
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:20,063	| IOT176 |	This recipe before
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:21,599	| IOT176 |	Otherwise it's not medium rare
EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:22,367	| IOT176 |	And then
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:24,159	| IOT176 |	By the time you're at the last Avenue
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:24,927	| IOT176 |	Distressing
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:27,999	| IOT176 |	Getting it ready to go in the oven the ovens already
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:29,023	| IOT176 |	Expecting salmon
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:31,071	| IOT176 |	And already know she wanted medium rare
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:32,863	| IOT176 |	So you didn't have to do anything other than
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:33,887	| IOT176 |	Put it in there
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:34,655	| IOT176 |	Walkaway

EDL	00:47:41,055	00:47:43,615	| IOT176 |	Are you looking to broaden that I mean
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:49,247	| IOT176 |	What are the challenges with cooking is people have their own recipes they want to find stuff everywhere
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:51,039	| IOT176 |	I feel like it'd be impossible to
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:53,343	| IOT176 |	Create these awesome recipe experiences
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:47:57,183	| IOT176 |	I searched bon appetit

EDL	00:48:01,023	00:48:03,583	| IOT176 |	I look at something and paying $5 a month for
EDL	00:48:03,583	00:48:06,655	| IOT176 |	Something that I can't bring all that a digital content into its
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:09,983	| IOT176 |	So are you looking to be in Bordeaux

EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:26,367	| IOT176 |	Really nice
EDL	00:48:28,159	00:48:30,207	| IOT176 |	We're cooking our pictures of habit
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:31,999	| IOT176 |	Most people cook the same things every week
EDL	00:48:31,999	00:48:34,047	| IOT176 |	And I know for my own behavior
EDL	00:48:34,047	00:48:36,095	| IOT176 |	I actually wish I was trying
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:36,863	| IOT176 |	You think more often
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:40,703	| IOT176 |	Discover something and then it just enters the routine
EDL	00:48:40,703	00:48:41,215	| IOT176 |	And so
EDL	00:48:41,727	00:48:42,751	| IOT176 |	Are you with the cookbook
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:44,287	| IOT176 |	Two recipes that
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:48,639	| IOT176 |	Weather in my regular routine now from the gym cookbook one is that are fried chicken and
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:52,479	| IOT176 |	Know the recipe mostly
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:52,991	| IOT176 |	Stewart
EDL	00:48:54,271	00:48:58,111	| IOT176 |	Watch the looping videos on the iPad of every single staff because I
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:02,207	| IOT176 |	Sorry I tried to cheat on the June cookbook
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:06,559	| IOT176 |	Fried Chicken 14 times I really don't need to watch blippi videos again
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:07,839	| IOT176 |	I forgot one of the most important
EDL	00:49:08,351	00:49:09,119	| IOT176 |	I literally
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:09,887	| IOT176 |	Room dinner
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:10,399	| IOT176 |	By skipping
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:12,191	| IOT176 |	And so even though
EDL	00:49:13,983	00:49:15,263	| IOT176 |	Following the steps
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:17,311	| IOT176 |	Keeping me honest and making sure that
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:18,591	| IOT176 |	Forget anything is really powerful
EDL	00:49:19,103	00:49:20,639	| IOT176 |	Air fried chicken
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:22,943	| IOT176 |	One of those dots to my regular routine
EDL	00:49:22,943	00:49:24,479	| IOT176 |	The other is this amazing
EDL	00:49:25,503	00:49:26,015	| IOT176 |	Salmon dish
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:32,927	| IOT176 |	Something that I I need to watch the steps everyday
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:39,071	| IOT176 |	Talk to me about some of this data that you've got I know that you guys for example you told the story to me
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:42,655	| IOT176 |	Cooking bacon in there
EDL	00:49:42,655	00:49:45,471	| IOT176 |	You realize that the most important variable in
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:47,263	| IOT176 |	Cooking bacon is how many slices
EDL	00:49:47,263	00:49:48,287	| IOT176 |	People use
EDL	00:49:48,287	00:49:51,103	| IOT176 |	So I'm curious what kind of data are you seeing both friend
EDL	00:49:51,103	00:49:53,919	| IOT176 |	Recipes
EDL	00:49:56,479	00:49:58,783	| IOT176 |	People were having bad
EDL	00:49:58,783	00:50:04,927	| IOT176 |	So we ended up taking all that data and those conversations and returned one bacon program in 264 bacon
EDL	00:50:09,791	00:50:11,071	| IOT176 |	Another really cool thing that
EDL	00:50:11,071	00:50:13,631	| IOT176 |	We're able to do is so now we have over
EDL	00:50:14,655	00:50:15,679	| IOT176 |	Automatically program
EDL	00:50:16,191	00:50:17,215	| IOT176 |	I'm all of them
EDL	00:50:17,215	00:50:18,751	| IOT176 |	No preheat and
EDL	00:50:18,751	00:50:19,775	| IOT176 |	We would get
EDL	00:50:19,775	00:50:21,823	| IOT176 |	In the app people can talk about their cooking
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:25,919	| IOT176 |	Cooking spray
EDL	00:50:25,919	00:50:27,711	| IOT176 |	Customer experience team
EDL	00:50:27,711	00:50:29,247	| IOT176 |	Things like restate program
EDL	00:50:29,247	00:50:30,271	| IOT176 |	Which in the beginning
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:31,039	| IOT176 |	Required
EDL	00:50:31,551	00:50:32,319	| IOT176 |	In the early days
EDL	00:50:32,319	00:50:34,111	| IOT176 |	And it was a three-step program
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:36,159	| IOT176 |	We would prompt you to look at at some point
EDL	00:50:40,511	00:50:45,887	| IOT176 |	And so we took it upon ourselves and our culinary team to how do we create a cook program
EDL	00:50:46,399	00:50:46,911	| IOT176 |	That
EDL	00:50:48,191	00:50:49,215	| IOT176 |	What's good or bad
EDL	00:50:49,215	00:50:49,727	| IOT176 |	Better
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:51,775	| IOT176 |	To do it
EDL	00:50:52,799	00:50:55,871	| IOT176 |	And we signed up for that challenge in our state program is now an eight
EDL	00:50:55,871	00:50:57,919	| IOT176 |	Step by step
EDL	00:50:57,919	00:50:58,943	| IOT176 |	Include the rest
EDL	00:50:58,943	00:51:00,735	| IOT176 |	In the middle of it and
EDL	00:51:00,735	00:51:01,247	| IOT176 |	People love it
EDL	00:51:02,271	00:51:04,319	| IOT176 |	It's great another thing that
EDL	00:51:04,319	00:51:05,599	| IOT176 |	Data wise was
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:06,879	| IOT176 |	We're able to look at
EDL	00:51:06,879	00:51:07,647	| IOT176 |	All the
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:12,255	| IOT176 |	Food that have been cooked in all the June ovens in the world and figure out what
EDL	00:51:12,255	00:51:13,535	| IOT176 |	And Lily stack rank
EDL	00:51:13,535	00:51:15,071	| IOT176 |	The top foods that we didn't have
EDL	00:51:15,071	00:51:16,351	| IOT176 |	Automated cook programs
EDL	00:51:16,351	00:51:17,375	| IOT176 |	Works we can create them
EDL	00:51:17,887	00:51:20,191	| IOT176 |	So actually I think about it
EDL	00:51:20,191	00:51:21,471	| IOT176 |	Reheating of tortillas
EDL	00:51:21,471	00:51:22,239	| IOT176 |	Was a top
EDL	00:51:22,239	00:51:24,543	| IOT176 |	3 use case that we had no cook program
EDL	00:51:25,311	00:51:25,823	| IOT176 |	Now we do
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:29,663	| IOT176 |	Cannot wait to try it I've been away from my June for far too long
EDL	00:51:29,663	00:51:30,687	| IOT176 |	What are some of the others
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:35,039	| IOT176 |	Pizza was always very popular in the gym and we have
EDL	00:51:35,039	00:51:38,111	| IOT176 |	A pizza program but we did not have a yesterday speech
EDL	00:51:38,111	00:51:38,879	| IOT176 |	Pizza
EDL	00:51:38,879	00:51:39,647	| IOT176 |	Program
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:40,927	| IOT176 |	Which is totally what you need
EDL	00:51:43,487	00:51:43,999	| IOT176 |	Some people do
EDL	00:51:44,511	00:51:45,279	| IOT176 |	Cookies in the oven
EDL	00:51:46,815	00:51:47,327	| IOT176 |	The pizzeria
EDL	00:51:49,887	00:51:51,167	| IOT176 |	On the oven
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:55,519	| IOT176 |	And we were seeing literally receipt just slices of pizza just sitting on racks
EDL	00:51:59,103	00:52:01,407	| IOT176 |	That we have yesterday's Pizza
EDL	00:52:02,687	00:52:03,711	| IOT176 |	Does it go in the rack
EDL	00:52:03,711	00:52:04,479	| IOT176 |	I always put my
EDL	00:52:05,247	00:52:06,783	| IOT176 |	Michael Mina recommend
EDL	00:52:06,783	00:52:10,623	| IOT176 |	Putting on a pizza stone under broil that's his official recommendation
EDL	00:52:11,647	00:52:15,231	| IOT176 |	I was like I was like a piece of stone that's pretty specialized stuff right there
EDL	00:52:17,023	00:52:17,535	| IOT176 |	It's already a lot
EDL	00:52:18,047	00:52:18,559	| IOT176 |	Ashley Reed
EDL	00:52:19,583	00:52:20,863	| IOT176 |	I just shove it in my mouth
EDL	00:52:20,863	00:52:22,143	| IOT176 |	Sometimes I am
EDL	00:52:23,167	00:52:25,983	| IOT176 |	Okay let's quickly talk about some of the
EDL	00:52:26,495	00:52:28,287	| IOT176 |	Gachas are things that have happened with
EDL	00:52:28,287	00:52:31,359	| IOT176 |	The oven so far so I was surprised to see that it's running
EDL	00:52:31,359	00:52:32,127	| IOT176 |	Android
EDL	00:52:32,127	00:52:32,895	| IOT176 |	This was back
EDL	00:52:32,895	00:52:36,479	| IOT176 |	Can a day are you guys still using Android or Android Things Are
EDL	00:52:36,479	00:52:37,247	| IOT176 |	Did you use
EDL	00:52:37,247	00:52:37,759	| IOT176 |	Something else for the
EDL	00:52:39,807	00:52:40,575	| IOT176 |	We
EDL	00:52:40,575	00:52:42,623	| IOT176 |	Have
EDL	00:52:42,623	00:52:43,391	| IOT176 |	And
EDL	00:52:43,391	00:52:44,671	| IOT176 |	On top of that there certain
EDL	00:52:44,671	00:52:46,463	| IOT176 |	Frameworks from Android
EDL	00:52:46,463	00:52:49,023	| IOT176 |	Design perspective
EDL	00:52:49,023	00:52:50,815	| IOT176 |	User experience perspective
EDL	00:52:50,815	00:52:54,655	| IOT176 |	There's no hint of Android with in any of the amazingly bill
EDL	00:52:54,655	00:52:58,751	| IOT176 |	We stretch the limits of what you can do with embedded Linux and certain Frameworks from Android
EDL	00:52:58,751	00:53:01,055	| IOT176 |	Create
EDL	00:53:01,055	00:53:02,335	| IOT176 |	What we call junoesque
EDL	00:53:02,335	00:53:04,127	| IOT176 |	So I don't need to worry about me
EDL	00:53:04,127	00:53:04,895	| IOT176 |	My Juno s not be

EDL	00:53:11,295	00:53:12,319	| IOT176 |	A sense of
EDL	00:53:12,319	00:53:13,343	| IOT176 |	How much it cost
EDL	00:53:13,343	00:53:15,391	| IOT176 |	To support a June oven
EDL	00:53:15,391	00:53:17,951	| IOT176 |	Annually or how much you guys are thinking about from
EDL	00:53:18,463	00:53:24,095	| IOT176 |	Cloud security cost I know you guys spend a lot of time and effort programs an update
EDL	00:53:24,095	00:53:24,863	| IOT176 |	Appreciate
EDL	00:53:25,375	00:53:27,935	| IOT176 |	I don't have a specific dollar answer for you but
EDL	00:53:27,935	00:53:28,703	| IOT176 |	From
EDL	00:53:28,703	00:53:29,471	| IOT176 |	Perspective
EDL	00:53:30,495	00:53:32,031	| IOT176 |	Design goals when we were
EDL	00:53:32,031	00:53:35,103	| IOT176 |	Designing June is we didn't want it to not
EDL	00:53:35,103	00:53:36,127	| IOT176 |	Work
EDL	00:53:36,127	00:53:37,407	| IOT176 |	Your Wi-Fi goes down
EDL	00:53:37,407	00:53:39,711	| IOT176 |	That would be the worst experience ever that you can cook
EDL	00:53:39,711	00:53:42,015	| IOT176 |	Cook dinner because your wife I went down
EDL	00:53:42,015	00:53:42,783	| IOT176 |	And so
EDL	00:53:42,783	00:53:44,575	| IOT176 |	We spend a lot of time engineering
EDL	00:53:44,575	00:53:46,879	| IOT176 |	An experience that doesn't actually require golang
EDL	00:53:46,879	00:53:47,391	| IOT176 |	The cloud
EDL	00:53:49,183	00:53:50,463	| IOT176 |	For example
