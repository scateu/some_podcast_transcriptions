EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:15,520	| IOT019 |	Really fascinating conversation we are literally going to understand how the sausage
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:16,800	| IOT019 |	Gets made
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:20,128	| IOT019 |	Cool before we do anything
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:21,664	| IOT019 |	5 we have to talk
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:22,176	| IOT019 |	About
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:24,224	| IOT019 |	Google News what do you think
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:28,832	| IOT019 |	C is for cookie and that's good enough for me yes the alphabet
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:30,112	| IOT019 |	C is for Calico
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:32,416	| IOT019 |	Google's longevity moonshot project
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:33,696	| IOT019 |	2
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:39,072	| IOT019 |	I really are they come up with 26 different little subsidiary type things now
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:41,376	| IOT019 |	They've got five or so of them covered already
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:44,704	| IOT019 |	So what happened is this week it was actually Monday
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:45,472	| IOT019 |	Google
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:46,752	| IOT019 |	Which is no longer
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:47,776	| IOT019 |	It's just Google
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:51,104	| IOT019 |	Purchase a Larry Page put up a blog post saying that
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:52,896	| IOT019 |	Google was going to become
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:54,432	| IOT019 |	Alphabet
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:59,040	| IOT019 |	Or actually alphabet was going to become a conglomeration of companies
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:01,344	| IOT019 |	And Google would only become
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:04,160	| IOT019 |	Part of those companies so Google would be one part
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:06,976	| IOT019 |	Write alphabets like a new public holding company
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:08,768	| IOT019 |	And Google is one of the
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:10,560	| IOT019 |	It's a subsidiary of alphabet
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:12,096	| IOT019 |	Rate
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:14,144	| IOT019 |	The company's name will be the alphabet Inc
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,680	| IOT019 |	But it will trade under
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:19,776	| IOT019 |	Goog goog the public shares of the company will trade under GOOG
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,056	| IOT019 |	And
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,336	| IOT019 |	Sundar pichai
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:26,688	| IOT019 |	He is going to be the CEO of Google
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:32,320	| IOT019 |	And all the Google properties that we know and love and use like Android Google Maps
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,344	| IOT019 |	YouTube
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:34,368	| IOT019 |	Hangouts
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:36,416	| IOT019 |	Gmail all those things
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:39,232	| IOT019 |	Are going to be part of Google so basically the ad funded side of the
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:41,536	| IOT019 |	Write the product side the
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:45,376	| IOT019 |	Yeah they're there their the money-making side it was all go under Google
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,400	| IOT019 |	Yay
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:46,912	| IOT019 |	Understand
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:48,448	| IOT019 |	And then
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:51,264	| IOT019 |	All the kind of crazy future thinking stuff like
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:52,800	| IOT019 |	Fiber
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,312	| IOT019 |	Nest
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,616	| IOT019 |	Project X Project X
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:56,640	| IOT019 |	Calico
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:57,664	| IOT019 |	And
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:00,992	| IOT019 |	It's Google capital and Google Investments are
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,016	| IOT019 |	I'll go under
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:06,112	| IOT019 |	Other category so what happens is now Google it has
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:09,696	| IOT019 |	It's two reporting structures for Wall Street investment purposes
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:15,840	| IOT019 |	So you'll see the beautiful money making side we're all that ad delicious delicious ad Revenue comes from
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:17,120	| IOT019 |	And then you're going to see like
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,144	| IOT019 |	Other
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:19,680	| IOT019 |	Other
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:23,520	| IOT019 |	I expect it probably doesn't make a lot of money
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:25,056	| IOT019 |	And that's where
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:25,824	| IOT019 |	Google's making all those
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,920	| IOT019 |	And Larry and Sergey will still be the
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:36,320	| IOT019 |	And I really don't know what they're going to do I think I just want to have more fun and less responsibility that's just me
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,344	| IOT019 |	I have to say
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:40,416	| IOT019 |	We want I wasn't kidding I don't think you were either
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:44,256	| IOT019 |	Yay for Sundar pichai because he came up through the ranks and
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:48,864	| IOT019 |	Took over Android for Andy Rubin couple years back and in 2013
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:55,008	| IOT019 |	And then he got Chrome and then he got all the Google products the docks and all the EX I think he had dogs before all of this
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,800	| IOT019 |	And now he's got like
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:04:03,200	| IOT019 |	Their entire product portfolio that makes the money so and I can't think of a better person there that promote from within from
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:03,968	| IOT019 |	Loadout slots
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:05,248	| IOT019 |	That's good news to me
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,272	| IOT019 |	She has earned
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:08,576	| IOT019 |	The blog post
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:13,952	| IOT019 |	To me it looks very clear Larry Page in the blog post said it's clear to B&R board
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,768	| IOT019 |	Siddharth deserves this
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:19,327	| IOT019 |	It sounds like Wall Street canopy adults
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:21,375	| IOT019 |	The table feel they were pushing him
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,911	| IOT019 |	So it makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,703	| IOT019 |	From The Internet of Things perspect
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,751	| IOT019 |	Couple things
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,031	| IOT019 |	1
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:30,591	| IOT019 |	We got to look at Nest I think this is great
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:34,175	| IOT019 |	From the perspective of nesto the other thing is
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:35,967	| IOT019 |	All of these Google
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:38,783	| IOT019 |	The separate other companies in alphabet
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,831	| IOT019 |	Nest is going to be its own cum
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:43,903	| IOT019 |	Each company is headed by its own CEO
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,719	| IOT019 |	My guess is he hasn't actually pink
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,743	| IOT019 |	Confirmed anywhere
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:50,815	| IOT019 |	Tony fadell will continue to be the CEO of nest
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:52,351	| IOT019 |	That would make sense that make sense
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,375	| IOT019 |	Should that change
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:54,655	| IOT019 |	Will let you know
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:58,751	| IOT019 |	I reach out to nest for comment they weren't commenting beyond the press release
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:03,615	| IOT019 |	But this is good for them because all along they've been a separate subsidiary of goo
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:06,175	| IOT019 |	When Google bought Nest back in
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:13,087	| IOT019 |	January of 2014 everyone was like
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:17,439	| IOT019 |	Thermostat this is terrible terrible terrible news for my privacy so anyway this is good
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,975	| IOT019 |	Well
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:21,023	| IOT019 |	Yes but I mean really
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:24,351	| IOT019 |	That dated will still get fed into Google I mean let's be honest
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:27,679	| IOT019 |	No doubt that's just been very clear that they don't give that dated
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:32,287	| IOT019 |	Okay alright I guess the bigger picture is that
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:36,127	| IOT019 |	These other companies will still feed data into the
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,407	| IOT019 |	Into the Google
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,175	| IOT019 |	Google
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:40,479	| IOT019 |	Shutting itself off from Gathering data from these companies
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,015	| IOT019 |	Well
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:45,343	| IOT019 |	If they do that they would have to change the terms of agreement
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,391	| IOT019 |	Nest
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:47,903	| IOT019 |	So
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:50,463	| IOT019 |	Google is not right now grabbing the nest
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,791	| IOT019 |	Yeah it is because it is separate
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,327	| IOT019 |	So what you're saying
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,095	| IOT019 |	Is it actually happy
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:00,703	| IOT019 |	Yeah well I guess that it will alleviate some people's concerns
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:07,359	| IOT019 |	I did okay so so they break it out and there's there's these walls that were implied or were really there before our
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,639	| IOT019 |	Certainly there now
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:12,991	| IOT019 |	And you know that the big questions are now is it
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,527	| IOT019 |	Much easier to spend this out
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,831	| IOT019 |	I would also say this is a very different
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,599	| IOT019 |	Revenue model
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:21,183	| IOT019 |	The Internet of Things play for Google has always
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,743	| IOT019 |	Post kind of an existential threat because
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:26,303	| IOT019 |	The beauty of the internet of things as you spend
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:31,167	| IOT019 |	Less time looking at a screen either your smartphone or your computer and more time
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:32,447	| IOT019 |	Interacting with
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:36,031	| IOT019 |	People in the devices around you hopefully in a more naturalistic way right
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:37,823	| IOT019 |	So
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:40,895	| IOT019 |	In a sense you spend less time searching and more time just like
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,431	| IOT019 |	Demanding things happen
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:44,991	| IOT019 |	Or just hoping things happen and they happen
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,271	| IOT019 |	Bright
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,039	| IOT019 |	So
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:48,575	| IOT019 |	We we know about nest
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,879	| IOT019 |	And we've seen what they've done
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:54,975	| IOT019 |	So far they still kept it separate and it is going to be separate going forward
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:56,511	| IOT019 |	I don't know that that's been
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:59,583	| IOT019 |	Great thing for Google's IRT efforts because
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:00,863	| IOT019 |	Less
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,655	| IOT019 |	With her and you can correct me
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:08,031	| IOT019 |	Set the nest team really hadn't work with Google on their brillo and we've stuff it was just nope those are two separate things
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,055	| IOT019 |	So it's like huh
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,591	| IOT019 |	What what are they doing
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,639	| IOT019 |	Well that is a darn good question
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:13,919	| IOT019 |	Because
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,199	| IOT019 |	No one I've talked to
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,479	| IOT019 |	In any of my source
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:18,271	| IOT019 |	No one
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:23,135	| IOT019 |	Don't want anywhere on the planet anywhere
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:26,975	| IOT019 |	In the chip world in the like device world
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:30,047	| IOT019 |	In the software or router world
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:36,447	| IOT019 |	The sense I get from all of those people is Google doesn't yet really know what
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:38,239	| IOT019 |	Brillo and weave
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,007	| IOT019 |	Is going to be
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,031	| IOT019 |	So
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:41,311	| IOT019 |	I find it
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,615	| IOT019 |	Futuristic so I asked
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:44,639	| IOT019 |	Google
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:49,759	| IOT019 |	What this meant for brillo and weave which was an Android effort
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,831	| IOT019 |	Said they would work with nest
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:58,463	| IOT019 |	And all of my sources say that Berlin Weaver coming out of Android they're not coming out of nest
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:59,743	| IOT019 |	Today will work with nest
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:05,887	| IOT019 |	Which means that brillouin we've just got split off from nest and sober alone we've are going to be
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:07,423	| IOT019 |	BOS effort
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,959	| IOT019 |	For The Internet of Things
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:10,239	| IOT019 |	And that's going to still be
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,775	| IOT019 |	Google
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,311	| IOT019 |	So is Nest just
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,335	| IOT019 |	Pretty much
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:20,735	| IOT019 |	Smart thermostat and a smoke detector and whatever other similar products they can think of
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:23,039	| IOT019 |	NetSpend is going to be a physical Products Company
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:31,999	| IOT019 |	It's a juice as you were is extra margins and revenue will come not just from selling physical products
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:38,143	| IOT019 |	But we'll be building better products in understanding how to use the data that it Gathers
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,423	| IOT019 |	From those products to
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,471	| IOT019 |	Field Services
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:46,847	| IOT019 |	Build additional better products and that's where I think we'll see kind of the Innovation coming from
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,359	| IOT019 |	On the nest
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:54,271	| IOT019 |	And I kind of thought they would have already made some Headway there I guess that goes back to my point that they really haven't done much of anything
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:59,391	| IOT019 |	I actually wondered was it worth it was a 3.2 billion dollars to Google patroness was it really worth it
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:01,183	| IOT019 |	So far I haven't seen a lot of in
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:01,951	| IOT019 |	Indications that it is
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:04,767	| IOT019 |	I'll be honest with you I think
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,303	| IOT019 |	Build some pretty devices
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,887	| IOT019 |	The promise that Tony fadell
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,655	| IOT019 |	Had
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,191	| IOT019 |	Was beautiful devices
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,727	| IOT019 |	And he's done that
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:14,239	| IOT019 |	Total check
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,311	| IOT019 |	The secondary Prime
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,591	| IOT019 |	And we'll get into that
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:24,991	| IOT019 |	Said lovely Segway actually is building these anticipatory kind of devices that give you
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,015	| IOT019 |	You information
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,551	| IOT019 |	When you need it in your home
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,367	| IOT019 |	And that is a lot harder
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,927	| IOT019 |	And so
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:36,767	| IOT019 |	Idea is that you know your thermostat your smartphone begins to know you
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,559	| IOT019 |	Can anticipate your needs
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:42,143	| IOT019 |	Is there a variety of reasons one
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,167	| IOT019 |	Being that
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:49,311	| IOT019 |	Devices don't work together and it's hard to build a stable of beautiful high-quality devices that
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,615	| IOT019 |	Minivan Apple
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,895	| IOT019 |	Apple doesn't build that
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,687	| IOT019 |	Devices
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,223	| IOT019 |	That's that's very difficult
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,015	| IOT019 |	So
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:04,159	| IOT019 |	My Nest is a wonderful example I think the works with Nest program actually is it's a really good program but even it's not perfect
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,207	| IOT019 |	And here comes mites
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,767	| IOT019 |	Then why is it not perfect Stacie
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,815	| IOT019 |	Tell me Stacy
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,839	| IOT019 |	I think it's a great motto
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:15,423	| IOT019 |	And one of my favorite examples is
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:17,471	| IOT019 |	The hue light bulb integration so
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:20,031	| IOT019 |	When you are away if you have an S
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,567	| IOT019 |	And you have the Philips hue light bulbs
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:24,895	| IOT019 |	Switch with the works with Nest program and
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,687	| IOT019 |	When you go away
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,711	| IOT019 |	In your lesson
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:29,759	| IOT019 |	Thermostat says hold is persons away
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:33,343	| IOT019 |	Are a few light bulbs will turn off and if you're away from more than one day
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:36,159	| IOT019 |	They will start toggling on and off on a
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:38,207	| IOT019 |	Pattern that somewhat random based on your schedule
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,767	| IOT019 |	I went on vacation
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:43,071	| IOT019 |	And my my lights did that
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,351	| IOT019 |	And it was
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,143	| IOT019 |	Awesome cuz I didn't set it
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,679	| IOT019 |	Except for that one time that I toggled
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,727	| IOT019 |	Except
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,287	| IOT019 |	When I got back from vacation
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,335	| IOT019 |	I noticed that my
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:54,847	| IOT019 |	Lights
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,639	| IOT019 |	When turn on
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:59,711	| IOT019 |	I don't know around 6 ish
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,223	| IOT019 |	In the evening
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:02,015	| IOT019 |	And when
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,575	| IOT019 |	I would get up in the morning my
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:06,367	| IOT019 |	Lights downstairs and if I left
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,183	| IOT019 |	If I left my bedside table lamp on
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:13,023	| IOT019 |	Like I didn't turn it physically off at the switch I left it on like for the
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:15,071	| IOT019 |	Electronics to take over
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,863	| IOT019 |	If that would actually turn on around 6
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:17,375	| IOT019 |	6:30 in the morning
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,167	| IOT019 |	I could not I was like
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,215	| IOT019 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:23,519	| IOT019 |	What is happening and what is this attached
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:27,615	| IOT019 |	What it what automation is causing this random thing to happen
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,663	| IOT019 |	Do you know what that sounds like
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:33,247	| IOT019 |	Well think about how the nest
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,807	| IOT019 |	Works when you get it you install it
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:37,599	| IOT019 |	And then you manually use it
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:39,391	| IOT019 |	Emitting about over the course of a week
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:42,975	| IOT019 |	A quote on quote learns how you want the house
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,743	| IOT019 |	Heated and cooled
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:50,655	| IOT019 |	And then you don't do anything anymore right uses the away sensor as well as your schedule because it has learned your schedule your behalf
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:56,287	| IOT019 |	I almost almost sounds and this is crazy it sounds to me like it's sink
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,823	| IOT019 |	Spent while you were away
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:00,127	| IOT019 |	That lady behavior is your actual Behavior
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,943	| IOT019 |	Check the schedule that
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:03,711	| IOT019 |	My nest
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:05,247	| IOT019 |	Tad ebright yes
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:08,063	| IOT019 |	Yes it is set my lights based on
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,855	| IOT019 |	That schedule yeah that's what it sounds like
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:10,623	| IOT019 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,647	| IOT019 |	That is what happened
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,695	| IOT019 |	It's so smart right
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:16,767	| IOT019 |	Not so much now but it wasn't
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:17,535	| IOT019 |	Smart enough
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,071	| IOT019 |	To realize that
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:19,839	| IOT019 |	When I came
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,119	| IOT019 |	Back
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,655	| IOT019 |	Did it had to turn that
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:25,983	| IOT019 |	Off exactly that schedule should be no longer
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:26,751	| IOT019 |	Valid
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:30,079	| IOT019 |	So it wasn't smart enough in that way in the other way it wasn't smart
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:32,383	| IOT019 |	Was there was no way that it
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:33,407	| IOT019 |	Tell me
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:35,967	| IOT019 |	That's what it was doing
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:39,039	| IOT019 |	That's right exactly it maybe if you're if you're not me
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:42,879	| IOT019 |	You probably don't have your Philips Hue Lights hooked up to your nest
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:43,647	| IOT019 |	To your wink
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:44,927	| IOT019 |	Echo
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,487	| IOT019 |	Write to you know me
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:52,863	| IOT019 |	Smarty face than that
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,375	| IOT019 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:55,935	| IOT019 |	Running down at list of things going
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:57,727	| IOT019 |	This probably isn't Edge case I would agree
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,007	| IOT019 |	But
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:01,055	| IOT019 |	I really want my smart home to have
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,359	| IOT019 |	Central Dash border like
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:06,943	| IOT019 |	And IRC or someplace where it's like
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:11,039	| IOT019 |	Hey Stacy I turned your lights on its 6:30 in the morning today
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,087	| IOT019 |	Because of this command
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,367	| IOT019 |	It came from here
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,159	| IOT019 |	If you don't like it
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:16,671	| IOT019 |	This is why
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:20,255	| IOT019 |	This gets back to where I used to love
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,023	| IOT019 |	Mine
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:23,071	| IOT019 |	Vnc on headless server
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:29,727	| IOT019 |	We're going to remotely log into and see the log file see all the commands see the scheduling and see everything that happened and why
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:32,287	| IOT019 |	And I understand that
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:34,591	| IOT019 |	Today's products don't have that because
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:38,175	| IOT019 |	Most people don't want that they want the Simplicity of it just working
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:39,199	| IOT019 |	The trick is
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:45,599	| IOT019 |	For people who do want it or need to dig into that those types of logs like you would probably want to do when you get home from vacation and noticed
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,367	| IOT019 |	Yeah this problem
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,927	| IOT019 |	It's all hidden away it's all distracted
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,439	| IOT019 |	And that's
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:53,279	| IOT019 |	You know that stuff still needs to be acceptable in my opinion
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:57,375	| IOT019 |	And I don't think that's too hard I think figuring out where that lives though
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:02,495	| IOT019 |	An issue like right now I don't have a 1 Central
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:03,007	| IOT019 |	Place for
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:06,591	| IOT019 |	So I finally figured it out and I wouldn't I turned it off
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:08,895	| IOT019 |	The world was a happy place in
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:10,431	| IOT019 |	You don't start waking up
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,967	| IOT019 |	When are lights in volunteer
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:18,623	| IOT019 |	But that was that was it a case of a little bit of wonkiness a little bit of something being
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:21,183	| IOT019 |	Not quite intuitive enough
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,719	| IOT019 |	But you know getting there
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:26,047	| IOT019 |	So that was that was that
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,327	| IOT019 |	We should probably move on to
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:31,679	| IOT019 |	What if it hadn't been just a little bit of wonkiness what've hitted been
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:33,727	| IOT019 |	Got done
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:34,495	| IOT019 |	Packers
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:37,055	| IOT019 |	And I am officially wearing a black hat today
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:39,103	| IOT019 |	Seattle
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,383	| IOT019 |	If only I were wearing my
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,991	| IOT019 |	Yeah there's a lot of action going on
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:50,111	| IOT019 |	I didn't catch the story but you mentioned before the show there was some type of zigbee hack
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:53,439	| IOT019 |	Again in I really probably shouldn't call
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:59,327	| IOT019 |	You know why I write these in headlines and I feel instantly guilty because it's really a vulnerability
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,119	| IOT019 |	So jiggly is
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,911	| IOT019 |	One of the more popular
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:05,215	| IOT019 |	Wireless radio protocols in the home
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:07,519	| IOT019 |	So if you got you no sensors in your home
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,847	| IOT019 |	It's highly likely it's a zigbee based sensor
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:13,151	| IOT019 |	Is a wireless mesh Network
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:13,663	| IOT019 |	Can protocol
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,967	| IOT019 |	Windows locks
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,271	| IOT019 |	Light bulb soda
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,551	| IOT019 |	My Philips Hue Lights
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,599	| IOT019 |	State-run zigbee
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:23,135	| IOT019 |	And they convert back to Wi-Fi
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,159	| IOT019 |	Lot of stuff
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,439	| IOT019 |	So
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,463	| IOT019 |	But don't freak out
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:28,255	| IOT019 |	So what happened is
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:29,791	| IOT019 |	A researcher
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,327	| IOT019 |	Presented a paper
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,095	| IOT019 |	At blackhat
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,375	| IOT019 |	This
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:33,887	| IOT019 |	This last
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:35,167	| IOT019 |	This last weekend
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:36,703	| IOT019 |	Found
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:39,519	| IOT019 |	A couple vulnerabilities with the zigbee profile
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,847	| IOT019 |	It and it's basically housing B shares its
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,359	| IOT019 |	Keys
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,663	| IOT019 |	It's encryption keys
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:47,711	| IOT019 |	So basically what happens is
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,247	| IOT019 |	It is it be Network
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:52,319	| IOT019 |	All the notes like they exchanged aqui
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:56,415	| IOT019 |	And the key basically that is used in most profiles is
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:16:00,255	| IOT019 |	Password it's the default encryption
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:03,839	| IOT019 |	Actually is it Bass Pro at the profiles are actually
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:07,935	| IOT019 |	128 bit AES encryption which is really good in Creek
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,495	| IOT019 |	Instead of like
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,263	| IOT019 |	Choosing
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,287	| IOT019 |	Many of the option
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:13,823	| IOT019 |	In search of psychologist
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,103	| IOT019 |	So
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:17,407	| IOT019 |	Kind of like using admin or password
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:21,247	| IOT019 |	If you guess the default you're highly likely to get in
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:24,575	| IOT019 |	Password is 1 2 3
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:28,159	| IOT019 |	Exactly so basically
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:31,231	| IOT019 |	Bet that's the first element and then there's some other Ella
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,511	| IOT019 |	In there like
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:40,191	| IOT019 |	A lot of the nose out there they're not using expensive zigbee radios they're using like these little low power
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:43,519	| IOT019 |	Not very smart CB radios so someone messes with them
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:48,383	| IOT019 |	You can't really tell because they don't shut down if someone messes with them they're just like
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:50,943	| IOT019 |	London. Someone mess with me now I'm like a
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:51,967	| IOT019 |	I'm like a
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,271	| IOT019 |	An evil node on the network
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,039	| IOT019 |	Hahaha
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:57,599	| IOT019 |	I won't tell anybody cuz I'm too dumb
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,391	| IOT019 |	Is that what they really sound like
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:06,559	| IOT019 |	That's what they sound like if you're ever around when I'm playing with my network all of my devices
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,327	| IOT019 |	Just have a little funny voices
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:12,447	| IOT019 |	After the show I'm going to talk to my light bulbs and see what they say
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:19,359	| IOT019 |	Didn't like that it is somewhat deadens the pain as you're like sitting there is hooking something up again and again to
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,455	| IOT019 |	So that's the vulnerability
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:27,295	| IOT019 |	I wrote about it in my call I say it's really time
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,087	| IOT019 |	To stop blaming the consumer
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:37,279	| IOT019 |	The Internet of Things is really complicated it is way too much to expect consumers to be like
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:42,399	| IOT019 |	I mean gas consumers should totally be updating their firmware we should be updating all the time
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:42,911	| IOT019 |	We should
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:45,215	| IOT019 |	You smart passwords I agree
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,519	| IOT019 |	But after that
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:51,103	| IOT019 |	It's time for a manufacturer's to like really step the heck up
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:59,039	| IOT019 |	Yeah it mean this is again this is different than and I know we talked about this before this is different than a mobile device
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:17:59,551	| IOT019 |	Sore
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:02,623	| IOT019 |	A laptop or desktop which obviously that gets
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:05,439	| IOT019 |	Packed into his is a bad thing no I'm not saying otherwise
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:08,255	| IOT019 |	But your house I mean that's your home that is
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:11,583	| IOT019 |	Azure domain and we need to make sure
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:14,143	| IOT019 |	But every safety precaution is taken when we start
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,679	| IOT019 |	Turning over
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:19,007	| IOT019 |	The house to these gadgets that special the connected ones
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:19,519	| IOT019 |	Exactly
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,079	| IOT019 |	I just
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:24,127	| IOT019 |	I'm kind of sick of this idea that
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,919	| IOT019 |	You know people are like
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:29,503	| IOT019 |	Is there so many camps like the New York Times just ran an op-ed
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:31,551	| IOT019 |	Yesterday in this this woman
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:32,831	| IOT019 |	Was like
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,879	| IOT019 |	We don't need the Internet of Things
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,159	| IOT019 |	You know it's
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:38,719	| IOT019 |	It's going to be insecure and it's stupid
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:40,511	| IOT019 |	And that was kind of the
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:42,559	| IOT019 |	Idea of her thesis was that
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:45,887	| IOT019 |	It's just too risky to attach all the stuff to the internet
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:48,703	| IOT019 |	And she ignored all the potential benefits and
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,007	| IOT019 |	I just was so frustrated by
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:57,407	| IOT019 |	That's like saying what are Amazon's what 20 years old now I think 15 years old whatever it is
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:00,223	| IOT019 |	Thanks 15 years old that's like saying now in today's day and age
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:02,783	| IOT019 |	You should never shop online Amazon because
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:04,319	| IOT019 |	You know reason AT&T
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,599	| IOT019 |	Security in
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,367	| IOT019 |	Privacy and
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,647	| IOT019 |	Credit card numbers
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:08,927	| IOT019 |	I mean
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:12,767	| IOT019 |	We got to realize this is the way the world is not going back
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,815	| IOT019 |	What time does SpaceX
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,095	| IOT019 |	I'd rather than
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:18,399	| IOT019 |	Say Doom and Gloom and don't ever use these things
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:20,959	| IOT019 |	Let's figure out how to beef up the security and make them
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:23,007	| IOT019 |	You know good enough that people are
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:28,127	| IOT019 |	You comfortable putting them in their houses and using them in on that way 15 years from now we don't have these kind of things about
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,407	| IOT019 |	House hacks and so on
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:31,455	| IOT019 |	Exactly know Morehouse hat
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,247	| IOT019 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,271	| IOT019 |	How about a car hack
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,063	| IOT019 |	A car a cat tell me about your kayak
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:38,623	| IOT019 |	Yeah this is disappointing because I think
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:44,767	| IOT019 |	I think it had to do with the OnStar system in particular although I'm sure it would work with various cars
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:48,351	| IOT019 |	And we have few no OnStar on the on The Bold and whatnot but
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:52,447	| IOT019 |	Yasso a digital researcher his name is Samy kamkar he
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:55,519	| IOT019 |	Put together $30 device
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:56,543	| IOT019 |	That can
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:58,591	| IOT019 |	Where do I copy the signal
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:02,175	| IOT019 |	Cars remote you know that the key fobs that unlock the car
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:06,015	| IOT019 |	Like many hacks and I would say this
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:06,783	| IOT019 |	Is a hack
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:10,879	| IOT019 |	This is only under certain situations and basically his device has to be
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,159	| IOT019 |	Near the car
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:15,231	| IOT019 |	When the car doors unlock so we can go grab
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,767	| IOT019 |	The wireless key code
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,279	| IOT019 |	It's not just
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:21,119	| IOT019 |	One key Cordova second read several because these things
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,655	| IOT019 |	Typical use rolling codes
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,959	| IOT019 |	Purple Tarzan for garage door switch
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:28,287	| IOT019 |	Attack works on garage doors to I can capture the codes to
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:29,567	| IOT019 |	To reopen those
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:30,335	| IOT019 |	So
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:34,431	| IOT019 |	Yeah that's that's bad and it again it gets back to what you were just saying
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:40,575	| IOT019 |	This comes down to the manufacturer's because what happened here when he figured out that the way to exploit this was
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,623	| IOT019 |	Codes don't expire
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:46,207	| IOT019 |	They can't be used more than once these rolling codes to unlock a car or garage door
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:49,535	| IOT019 |	But they don't expire so if it was never used in the first place because his
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:50,303	| IOT019 |	Is little
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,583	| IOT019 |	Device captured it
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:53,119	| IOT019 |	It's a valid code
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:57,727	| IOT019 |	So the manufacturers have to work on some expirations on these throwing codes and such because right now
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,263	| IOT019 |	There's somebody who can
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:00,799	| IOT019 |	30 bucks go out
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,591	| IOT019 |	Get a little you know what device to
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:05,919	| IOT019 |	Get your key code and unlock your door for your car or
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:06,687	| IOT019 |	The garage door
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:08,479	| IOT019 |	Honestly I my car I'd probably rather
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,015	| IOT019 |	My car intro
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,575	| IOT019 |	Keep anything in my car
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:16,159	| IOT019 |	Bluetooth 2.1 replacement anyway
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:16,928	| IOT019 |	That's true
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:23,072	| IOT019 |	We will talk about my journey to a smarter car soon
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:26,656	| IOT019 |	So that's all I think that's almost all the time we have I should
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:28,192	| IOT019 |	Note because
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,984	| IOT019 |	People who like Wi-Fi will like this
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,008	| IOT019 |	D-Link
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:34,336	| IOT019 |	His launched a Wi-Fi
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,104	| IOT019 |	Water
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:35,872	| IOT019 |	Sensor
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,152	| IOT019 |	Which is exciting
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:40,736	| IOT019 |	I cuz it's Wi-Fi because it's Wi-Fi
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:41,248	| IOT019 |	So
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:42,528	| IOT019 |	Yay
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:44,320	| IOT019 |	It does have to be
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,600	| IOT019 |	Be plugged in
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:48,928	| IOT019 |	So it's being plugged in at the wall
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,208	| IOT019 |	And then it's
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:54,304	| IOT019 |	It's a 1.6 ft sensor cable so what you do is you plug it in
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:56,096	| IOT019 |	And then
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:56,864	| IOT019 |	There is a
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,400	| IOT019 |	Lan cable
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,936	| IOT019 |	In the censors at the tip of it
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:02,752	| IOT019 |	So that's how they dealt with the power issues associated
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,032	| IOT019 |	I would
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,312	| IOT019 |	Are considerable so this
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:07,104	| IOT019 |	My mind is
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:10,176	| IOT019 |	So far the only Wi-Fi water sensor on the market
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:11,456	| IOT019 |	Which is why I'm telling
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:12,224	| IOT019 |	That's about it
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:14,016	| IOT019 |	Because a lot of people like that sort of thing
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:18,368	| IOT019 |	And Belkin WeMo is supposed to have a Wi-Fi water sensor
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:20,672	| IOT019 |	Sometime
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,720	| IOT019 |	And send it to email will work with Echo
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,512	| IOT019 |	Incentives Wiimote will work with Echo
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:27,328	| IOT019 |	Which means the echo could possibly be like
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:29,120	| IOT019 |	Alert alert
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:31,680	| IOT019 |	This stealing one will actually
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:33,216	| IOT019 |	Also work with the siren
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,496	| IOT019 |	There's a Wi-Fi siren
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:35,776	| IOT019 |	Or you can
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:39,616	| IOT019 |	You can just have me around your house saying alert alert if you'd like that
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:42,688	| IOT019 |	Maybe you should put an MP3 up on
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,200	| IOT019 |	Podcast
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:47,040	| IOT019 |	You could be ringtone it could be your ringtone
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,320	| IOT019 |	Side
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:53,440	| IOT019 |	Wait one more thing before we go to the gas real quick I'll keep it short at prom
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:23:00,608	| IOT019 |	Way back I want to say in December last year you tested the Cree LED connected bulbs is that right
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:04,960	| IOT019 |	Okay and you did not like a particular aspect or two about them which was
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:06,240	| IOT019 |	Oh they Buzz
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:09,056	| IOT019 |	Yeah when you Dim them
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:12,640	| IOT019 |	That's true they buzzed
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:20,320	| IOT019 |	All right so I talked to the folks at creepy I asked him about this and they're like well we don't know what space is used
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,344	| IOT019 |	Listen that
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:26,720	| IOT019 |	So they didn't acknowledge that there was an issue or any like that but I said look at it if you don't think it was any more send me one
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:28,000	| IOT019 |	So guess what
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:33,376	| IOT019 |	And I have been using it for the past week and a half in My Den I got to connect to my echo so I can
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:39,264	| IOT019 |	Got turn it on or turn it off from the echo or I can do it from my Wink app because it's
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,544	| IOT019 |	Wink compatible bulb
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:47,200	| IOT019 |	And I'm not here in the buzzing you know what I'm getting old so I said you know what let me get my kids to a much better hearing
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,992	| IOT019 |	You guys listen to me dimmed it
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:49,760	| IOT019 |	Always
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:51,808	| IOT019 |	Six ways til Sunday turn on turn off
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:53,856	| IOT019 |	Didn't hear it either so
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:54,368	| IOT019 |	Mine was in a
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:24:00,000	| IOT019 |	That may be why then
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:02,560	| IOT019 |	And the GE dimmer so both
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:04,608	| IOT019 |	Dimmable LED bulbs
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:06,656	| IOT019 |	I tested them in a
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,680	| IOT019 |	Dimmable lamp
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,728	| IOT019 |	Okay so they only Buzz
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,752	| IOT019 |	Best in the dimmable
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:14,336	| IOT019 |	That's okay
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:17,152	| IOT019 |	Good to know so people if you're going to Disney's these bulbs
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:20,992	| IOT019 |	I don't want to put them in the right table lamp
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:26,624	| IOT019 |	Just put them in a regular laughing and control the dimming through an app for voice however you want to do that so
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:33,024	| IOT019 |	These are the $15 white bulbs just so everybody knows the color temp is not my favorite it's 2700 Kelvin
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:33,792	| IOT019 |	Sandwiches
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:36,096	| IOT019 |	Yellowish soft white but that's okay
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,632	| IOT019 |	815 lumens
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:42,496	| IOT019 |	And only uses 11 and 1/2 watt we fill the 60 watt replacement that they sent me
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:44,032	| IOT019 |	So it's working great
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:48,640	| IOT019 |	I'm fine with the soft white in My Den I'm not keen on that my office I use the daylight
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:49,408	| IOT019 |	Types
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,432	| IOT019 |	But
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:52,480	| IOT019 |	He's in a regular lamp then
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:56,320	| IOT019 |	They should be just fine at 4:15 bucks you got a connected zigbee bulb
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:56,832	| IOT019 |	From tree
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:59,904	| IOT019 |	Hey and Kevin just for those of us who don't speak Eldon
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,952	| IOT019 |	What is the daylight temperature
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:08,608	| IOT019 |	The daylight temperature is between 5000 kelvins 5000 kelvins and up
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,888	| IOT019 |	The bulbs that I have the
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:12,960	| IOT019 |	Sylvania osram bulbs that I have three of those
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:16,032	| IOT019 |	Those are tunable so I can go to down from 2700
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:18,592	| IOT019 |	Kelvin's to 6500 Kelvins
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:21,664	| IOT019 |	Does go all the way up to daylight which is 5000 and up
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:23,968	| IOT019 |	So that is
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:30,112	| IOT019 |	The update on the crease which is awesome that gives you another $15 ish option for those of you guys were like
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:32,928	| IOT019 |	Connect LEDs or bus
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:37,792	| IOT019 |	Relatively cheap I should say you know it's still more expensive than LED bulb but
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:41,120	| IOT019 |	4:15 bucks you almost can't go wrong
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,400	| IOT019 |	I certainly can
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:44,960	| IOT019 |	So because I've got it connected through the wink hub
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:46,496	| IOT019 |	Through the wing
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:47,520	| IOT019 |	Steppin
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:48,544	| IOT019 |	You talk to through the
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,080	| IOT019 |	That is correct
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:56,224	| IOT019 |	It's all seamless it doesn't mean it sounds complicated but it's not it's not can you control cuz I had control
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:26:01,344	| IOT019 |	Decrees also through the Hughes but I could only do that I think a tattoo out of
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,624	| IOT019 |	Three of the Crees I was sent
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,672	| IOT019 |	And I had to do it manually
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,952	| IOT019 |	I couldn't search for it automatic
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:11,328	| IOT019 |	I only have one Cree bulb so I couldn't say how it work with multiples but
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:15,424	| IOT019 |	I did the search actually in the Wink app you just choose you know to add a product and
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:17,984	| IOT019 |	There's like a zillion choices in their anus
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:21,312	| IOT019 |	Go to the bulbs and craze listed in there and that was it
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:22,848	| IOT019 |	I was just like discovering any other bulb
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,896	| IOT019 |	But if you didn't have a wink
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:28,480	| IOT019 |	I don't know because I do have a wink
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:29,504	| IOT019 |	The question
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:30,016	| IOT019 |	So
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:34,112	| IOT019 |	I don't know if you want to unpair it from the wink just to make your life interesting
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:36,672	| IOT019 |	And see if you can add it to the hue
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:41,280	| IOT019 |	Cuz you would also could serve for those of you guys out there who have an echo but no
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:42,304	| IOT019 |	Wait wait
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:43,072	| IOT019 |	But you do have a key
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:46,144	| IOT019 |	That would be another possible option
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:47,680	| IOT019 |	That's correct
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:51,264	| IOT019 |	So I could possibly try that cuz I still have the Huey others not active right now
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:53,056	| IOT019 |	You don't have to
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:55,872	| IOT019 |	I'm just thinking out loud. You love giving me homework
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:56,896	| IOT019 |	Baidu
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:01,504	| IOT019 |	That was a terrible evil laugh is it really work
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,808	| IOT019 |	It's cuz I'm not really evil
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:04,832	| IOT019 |	All right
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:07,648	| IOT019 |	We have got way over time
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:09,440	| IOT019 |	Keyboard with us because
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,208	| IOT019 |	If you stay tuned

EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:13,696	| IOT019 |	Because
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:16,000	| IOT019 |	I've already like bombarding him with Quest
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:17,280	| IOT019 |	So
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:19,072	| IOT019 |	To get started
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:19,584	| IOT019 |	Ryan
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:22,912	| IOT019 |	June is a company that I have written about
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:24,960	| IOT019 |	It is making a connected oven
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:30,848	| IOT019 |	It's very expensive but I'm already kind of like who I cannot wait for this to happen so
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:33,408	| IOT019 |	First off tell me a little bit about
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:35,712	| IOT019 |	June and why you came to work
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:37,248	| IOT019 |	With them as a research Chef
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:39,552	| IOT019 |	I came to June because
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:42,112	| IOT019 |	I was immediately Blown Away
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:43,648	| IOT019 |	Buy the product
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,160	| IOT019 |	And I was
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:46,464	| IOT019 |	Super excited to be part of the team that was
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,768	| IOT019 |	Doing something that nobody else was
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:54,912	| IOT019 |	And once I got to know that the people in the company I really got us sent the pictures of thing.
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:57,216	| IOT019 |	Integrity
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:58,752	| IOT019 |	Design something
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,800	| IOT019 |	You know Lord really really well
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,568	| IOT019 |	Awesome
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:03,616	| IOT019 |	So for those of you guys are out there
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:09,248	| IOT019 |	Okay a connected oven this is not connected oven that is in your wall this is a countertop oven
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:12,320	| IOT019 |	And it is not just connected to the internet
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:12,832	| IOT019 |	What they've done
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:14,880	| IOT019 |	Is a padded Wi-Fi
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:16,160	| IOT019 |	But they've also added
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:17,952	| IOT019 |	Sensors in the feet of the oven
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:20,000	| IOT019 |	They've added a camera
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:23,328	| IOT019 |	And they've added an AI so basically what happens is
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:24,352	| IOT019 |	You can
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:26,400	| IOT019 |	Oana temperature probe
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:26,912	| IOT019 |	I should add that
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:29,472	| IOT019 |	So you can pop something into the June oven
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,544	| IOT019 |	Can recognize that using the camera
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,080	| IOT019 |	And the AI
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:39,200	| IOT019 |	And it can tell how much this object that you put in their ways
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:40,736	| IOT019 |	I can tell you the temperature of it
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:44,320	| IOT019 |	And then because it recognizes what it is how much it weighs
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,112	| IOT019 |	And it's temperature
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:49,952	| IOT019 |	And it has this kind of database of recipes about it it can
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:50,976	| IOT019 |	Basically say
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:53,280	| IOT019 |	Hey looks like you're baking a roast
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:57,376	| IOT019 |	You want to cook it for this long and it kind of gives you an ideal sense of
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,656	| IOT019 |	How long you should
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:29:59,936	| IOT019 |	Cookies
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:00,960	| IOT019 |	Is that about it
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:02,752	| IOT019 |	Getting better
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:04,544	| IOT019 |	I probably could have cut another 30 second
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:05,824	| IOT019 |	But
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:09,664	| IOT019 |	They've launched and I want to say it costs about $1,500
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:12,736	| IOT019 |	So it's kind of pricey
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:14,272	| IOT019 |	Most
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:18,368	| IOT019 |	Trays if it's most things that will not cook your Thanksgiving
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:24,512	| IOT019 |	So this will not replace your existing oven for people who are probably serious about
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:26,304	| IOT019 |	Mega cooking
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:27,328	| IOT019 |	But
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:30,400	| IOT019 |	You know what do you think about the products like from a
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:31,936	| IOT019 |	Professional chef standpoint
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:35,264	| IOT019 |	I love it I think it's a total game changer
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:36,800	| IOT019 |	What I love about it is
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:39,872	| IOT019 |	Cooking can be very intimidating
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:40,896	| IOT019 |	And
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:45,504	| IOT019 |	Having to do is is really inspire
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,040	| IOT019 |	Confidence
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,064	| IOT019 |	Tujunga
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:50,368	| IOT019 |	It's amazing how getting
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,136	| IOT019 |	Something bright
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:53,696	| IOT019 |	Create confidence and how you want to
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:54,464	| IOT019 |	Do that again
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:58,816	| IOT019 |	I think some people when they try recipe and they don't get it right the first time
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:01,632	| IOT019 |	Totally
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:03,936	| IOT019 |	I'm not going to try that again
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,216	| IOT019 |	I'm such a bad
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:06,752	| IOT019 |	What we really wanted
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:09,056	| IOT019 |	Really good people in their kitchens and
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,848	| IOT019 |	Inspire them to
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:12,128	| IOT019 |	Create Greg Nielsen
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:13,152	| IOT019 |	All right
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:15,712	| IOT019 |	So this isn't actually just a big giant
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:18,528	| IOT019 |	Woohoo going by the June oven
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:21,856	| IOT019 |	The reason I actually had you on the show Ryan is because
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:24,672	| IOT019 |	I am a huge believer in
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,464	| IOT019 |	Kind of I guess
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:28,000	| IOT019 |	The equalizing value of
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:28,768	| IOT019 |	Technology in the kitchen
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:30,560	| IOT019 |	And a lot of people are kind of like
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:32,352	| IOT019 |	I do not need
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:32,864	| IOT019 |	PetSmart
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:36,704	| IOT019 |	And did they used to be the truth of the Internet of Things
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:39,776	| IOT019 |	And I'm totally with them I don't need a smart refrigerator
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:45,920	| IOT019 |	I have been trying to sell and no one's made it for me so far but I've been trying to get someone to make me
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,992	| IOT019 |	Actually a spoon that measures viscosity
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:52,064	| IOT019 |	Because I think a spoon that measures viscosity
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:54,368	| IOT019 |	Would be an amazing tool for
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:56,672	| IOT019 |	Someone learning how to cook because
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:59,488	| IOT019 |	When you're trying to make a sauce or
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:01,280	| IOT019 |	Candy or something like that I think
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:03,328	| IOT019 |	Understanding how thick
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:06,144	| IOT019 |	Your sinuses is really an important thing
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:09,472	| IOT019 |	So I think tools like that or even something like having
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:13,056	| IOT019 |	Camera in the oven that can understand that
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:17,408	| IOT019 |	The skin on your roast chicken is just Brown enough that's the perfect amount of doneness
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:20,736	| IOT019 |	Those are the kind of ways that technology can really
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,528	| IOT019 |	Help home
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:24,064	| IOT019 |	Cooks are people learning how to cook
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:26,624	| IOT019 |	I'm so I would love to get your philosophy
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,696	| IOT019 |	How technology
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,232	| IOT019 |	Can really help
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:33,792	| IOT019 |	Cooking or help people
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:34,816	| IOT019 |	In the kitchen
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:37,376	| IOT019 |	And maybe doesn't learning to cook maybe it's people who already know how to
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:38,912	| IOT019 |	How to get
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:40,448	| IOT019 |	Ryan's
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:42,240	| IOT019 |	Philosophy of technology in the kitchen
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:45,824	| IOT019 |	Recognized
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:46,848	| IOT019 |	Edible ideas
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:51,712	| IOT019 |	I did a spoon demetric viscosity
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:54,784	| IOT019 |	I look the same.
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:57,344	| IOT019 |	You know you work for a company that
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:58,624	| IOT019 |	You know that they might get on
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:06,560	| IOT019 |	I love that I think that's a great idea
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:09,376	| IOT019 |	Isaac technology
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:13,728	| IOT019 |	As long as it as long as it works
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:15,008	| IOT019 |	And
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:16,800	| IOT019 |	PS I think I think
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:17,568	| IOT019 |	Doorways
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:19,616	| IOT019 |	Currency to simplify
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:24,224	| IOT019 |	You have something like a sous vide
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:24,992	| IOT019 |	Machine
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:27,296	| IOT019 |	It's such a simple easy
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:30,880	| IOT019 |	Appliances
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:32,672	| IOT019 |	Absolutely stunning
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:33,952	| IOT019 |	Consistent
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:34,464	| IOT019 |	Someone play
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:37,024	| IOT019 |	Are my feet so
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:38,304	| IOT019 |	Nervous to
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,584	| IOT019 |	Chicken breast
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:43,168	| IOT019 |	Because they don't know whether or not it's going to come out wrong
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:44,192	| IOT019 |	Or overcome
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:48,800	| IOT019 |	Music something like an immersion circulator sous-vide machine
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,336	| IOT019 |	Temperature
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:56,480	| IOT019 |	I can see the machines doing the work for then making sure
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:57,760	| IOT019 |	The chicken comes out perfectly
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:00,064	| IOT019 |	The way I think about
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:01,088	| IOT019 |	Technology in the
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:01,856	| IOT019 |	Kitchen
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:02,368	| IOT019 |	Is
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:06,720	| IOT019 |	I kind of divided up into three things or maybe it's four things
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:09,024	| IOT019 |	Google datastore will figure this out
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:10,560	| IOT019 |	There's the planning side of it
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:11,840	| IOT019 |	So there's the
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:13,120	| IOT019 |	The meal planning
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:14,400	| IOT019 |	Right if I'm thinking about
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:15,168	| IOT019 |	Home chef
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:16,192	| IOT019 |	There's prep
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:20,032	| IOT019 |	And so into that I'm thinking about like the drop kitchen scale
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:20,544	| IOT019 |	Or
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:23,360	| IOT019 |	Countertop by the orange chef
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:27,456	| IOT019 |	There's cooking so into that would fall like the June oven or
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:31,040	| IOT019 |	I can't think of the name of it but it's that little knob on your stove
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:32,832	| IOT019 |	There's the
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:34,112	| IOT019 |	The iGrill or the
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:35,648	| IOT019 |	Amber
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:37,184	| IOT019 |	Thermometer
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:37,696	| IOT019 |	Kind of things
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:41,280	| IOT019 |	I don't know if there's anything on serving
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:43,072	| IOT019 |	Consumption so that could be like
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:45,376	| IOT019 |	Vessel that the cup
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,400	| IOT019 |	Maybe the habit
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:47,424	| IOT019 |	Twerk It
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:52,288	| IOT019 |	Any sort of calorie counting apps or things like that so
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:55,104	| IOT019 |	I think about the world
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:55,872	| IOT019 |	Kind of Technology
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:59,200	| IOT019 |	Does that seem like a fair kind of breakdown
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:03,552	| IOT019 |	Absolutely and I think that's such a
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:05,088	| IOT019 |	Common philosophy that's growing
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:06,624	| IOT019 |	United States
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:08,416	| IOT019 |	If you if you look at it like that
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:11,488	| IOT019 |	Where do you think technology like
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:14,560	| IOT019 |	Does it make sense to have technology across all of those
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:15,840	| IOT019 |	Categories or
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:18,656	| IOT019 |	Where do you think it makes the most sense to
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:23,520	| IOT019 |	If your home cookware does it makes the most sense to invest because
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,800	| IOT019 |	Right now
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:30,944	| IOT019 |	Things don't necessarily work across all of these are going to be nice if I could buy a tool in each category
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:34,784	| IOT019 |	I could assure myself that everything worked across every
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:36,576	| IOT019 |	Category right but they don't so
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,392	| IOT019 |	Removing more
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,440	| IOT019 |	Toward integrated products
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:45,280	| IOT019 |	I'm having a built-in digital scale
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:46,560	| IOT019 |	Temperature
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:50,656	| IOT019 |	People are going to restaurant
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:52,960	| IOT019 |	A lot of new technology
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:58,848	| IOT019 |	Restaurant vent and hearing new terms and they're they're going to bring that home
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:01,920	| IOT019 |	There's a you know
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:03,456	| IOT019 |	A common theme in restaurants
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:05,504	| IOT019 |	Precision and concision
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:07,040	| IOT019 |	Is
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:09,344	| IOT019 |	Really wants restaurants
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:13,952	| IOT019 |	A lot of consumers want that in their home
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:16,000	| IOT019 |	How can I make
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:18,304	| IOT019 |	Perfectly
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:19,584	| IOT019 |	Cooked chicken
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:25,984	| IOT019 |	165 degrees and how can I do that each and every time
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:28,032	| IOT019 |	How did you use technology
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:30,336	| IOT019 |	Prior to working for June
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:31,360	| IOT019 |	In your kitchen
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:34,176	| IOT019 |	Cuz you were a private Chef before and then you would also worked
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,456	| IOT019 |	In
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:36,224	| IOT019 |	Professional kitchen

EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:51,072	| IOT019 |	Because technology that's coming out
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:52,864	| IOT019 |	You know my favorite
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:55,936	| IOT019 |	Appliances in my home would be
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:57,728	| IOT019 |	An immersion circulator
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:58,752	| IOT019 |	I use a lot of
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:37:02,592	| IOT019 |	Chamber ceiling batting machine so I can
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:05,920	| IOT019 |	Assist with cookie TV tonight
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:08,992	| IOT019 |	Take care of ingredients
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:12,064	| IOT019 |	If I go to the Farmers Market
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:14,624	| IOT019 |	Ansan incredibly beautiful
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:17,440	| IOT019 |	Strawberries I can vacuum sealed
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:20,000	| IOT019 |	The winter
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:23,584	| IOT019 |	Another one of my favorite tools is
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:24,864	| IOT019 |	And
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:27,168	| IOT019 |	It's a high speed blender
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:28,192	| IOT019 |	It has a
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:28,704	| IOT019 |	Heating element
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:31,520	| IOT019 |	So you can actually
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:33,056	| IOT019 |	Cook in a blender
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:35,872	| IOT019 |	Oh my God you can make the best lemon custard and what if those things
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:38,432	| IOT019 |	Sorry
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:40,480	| IOT019 |	Incredible
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:41,248	| IOT019 |	Hollandaise
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:45,344	| IOT019 |	I'm making yeah making ice cream bases
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:48,928	| IOT019 |	Risotto
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:51,744	| IOT019 |	Wow cuz you would lose all of the leg
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:52,512	| IOT019 |	Chunkiness yes
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:53,792	| IOT019 |	Of the
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:54,304	| IOT019 |	Risotto
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:56,864	| IOT019 |	Yeah and I don't know how you get
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:02,496	| IOT019 |	Maybe you know the agitation from
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:04,544	| IOT019 |	The blender might be able to
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:08,128	| IOT019 |	Okay I'm sitting here imagining like
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:09,920	| IOT019 |	Ricey cheesy pudding
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:12,224	| IOT019 |	Creation Institute
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:15,552	| IOT019 |	Which might also be delicious I I love anything
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:16,576	| IOT019 |	It's
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:19,136	| IOT019 |	Start cheating
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:19,648	| IOT019 |	Cheesy
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:21,184	| IOT019 |	Custody
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,720	| IOT019 |	As you can tell
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:25,024	| IOT019 |	At 4 my lemon custard enthusiasm there
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:29,376	| IOT019 |	So those are now are any of the things in your kid
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:37,312	| IOT019 |	I'm not using I don't use any of my my
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:38,592	| IOT019 |	Did Isis control them
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:41,152	| IOT019 |	Cuz they're at they're actually
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:41,920	| IOT019 |	A sous vide
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:46,784	| IOT019 |	Any sort of connected like some of the more popular in early connected
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:48,320	| IOT019 |	Devices were actually sous vide
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:50,368	| IOT019 |	Kind of homemade sous-vide things
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:52,672	| IOT019 |	Done in Crock-Pot
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:54,720	| IOT019 |	Actually just hack together with Arduino shoes
EDL	00:38:55,232	00:38:56,000	| IOT019 |	So I'm kind of
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:58,560	| IOT019 |	Curious because you could actually control
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:02,400	| IOT019 |	And modulate the temperature of things from afar if you wanted to
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:04,448	| IOT019 |	I don't know if that appeals to you or not
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:09,056	| IOT019 |	Yeah it is absolutely doesnae I think that those early model
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:11,360	| IOT019 |	Their only drawback was
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:14,176	| IOT019 |	Precision
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:15,200	| IOT019 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:16,480	| IOT019 |	Devices for using
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:19,296	| IOT019 |	Sous vide
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:20,832	| IOT019 |	Just it's all about precision
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:21,856	| IOT019 |	Censure
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:24,928	| IOT019 |	More and more companies will be designing
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:26,976	| IOT019 |	Circulators
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:28,256	| IOT019 |	You're able to control from you
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:32,096	| IOT019 |	I got another device
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:33,120	| IOT019 |	Yeah I can't wait for that
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:36,448	| IOT019 |	We talked a bit about your philosophy of
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:37,728	| IOT019 |	Cooking in the kitchen
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:38,240	| IOT019 |	End
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:41,568	| IOT019 |	Like I said like you like you said actually
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,592	| IOT019 |	This opens up
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:46,688	| IOT019 |	Kind of a world of cooking and I will say that when I was testing out
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:49,504	| IOT019 |	It was the drop kitchen scale
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:54,880	| IOT019 |	I thought it was kind of frustrating because they had a very modular recipe structure
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:39:56,416	| IOT019 |	It was like
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:57,952	| IOT019 |	Do this then do this
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:00,768	| IOT019 |	And I'm a little bit more slapdash in
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:04,608	| IOT019 |	How I cook and I like to consolidate bowls and that sort of thing and they were like
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:07,168	| IOT019 |	But this invisible and
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:08,192	| IOT019 |	Put this on the scale
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:12,288	| IOT019 |	I hated it
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,568	| IOT019 |	Scaleworks
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:17,664	| IOT019 |	The recipes that you had to use are the recipes they had in there at
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:19,456	| IOT019 |	I thought were a little
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:20,736	| IOT019 |	They used a little too much butter
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:21,504	| IOT019 |	But
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:25,600	| IOT019 |	You know it was fun my daughter though loved it she's actually wants one for her birthday
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:27,136	| IOT019 |	Because
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:32,000	| IOT019 |	She's never begged before and she loved the fact that it told her step by step
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:34,560	| IOT019 |	Told her exactly what to do and then
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:37,120	| IOT019 |	You know when you measure it on the scale that step was
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:39,424	| IOT019 |	What's done in a rush to cross the iPad screen
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:42,240	| IOT019 |	Nextep appeared
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:47,104	| IOT019 |	It was it was so interactive it had the screen component she thought it was fun she's
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:48,896	| IOT019 |	8 years old this is great
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:53,504	| IOT019 |	And watching her do that I was like you. This is a great way
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:54,528	| IOT019 |	To learn how to cook
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:57,856	| IOT019 |	And iiii just be very curious like
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:01,952	| IOT019 |	Bring this kind of technology in
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:03,744	| IOT019 |	Two everyday objects
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:06,304	| IOT019 |	Without it being quite so
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:13,216	| IOT019 |	I guess maybe quite so expensive or quite so I mean cuz the drop kitchen scale was $100
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:16,288	| IOT019 |	And then you had all these kind of customized dresses
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:17,568	| IOT019 |	The peace that you had to run
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:18,336	| IOT019 |	With the scale
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:21,408	| IOT019 |	Obviously you could use it like a normal kitchen scale but it wasn't his kind of
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:22,688	| IOT019 |	Fun in modular
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:26,784	| IOT019 |	And just trying to think you know normal people are not going to
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:27,552	| IOT019 |	Redo the way they
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:28,832	| IOT019 |	Right
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:30,880	| IOT019 |	That seems like a big ass
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:31,392	| IOT019 |	Ferlife
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:35,488	| IOT019 |	There's there's supposed to cost element to Bringing technology into the
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:39,072	| IOT019 |	Kitchen and then there's also a lot of these kind of services ask
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:40,352	| IOT019 |	People search
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:43,680	| IOT019 |	Either pick up new recipes or kind of
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:44,960	| IOT019 |	Cook a slightly different way
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:47,776	| IOT019 |	Do you think that's just crazy
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:50,592	| IOT019 |	I don't think it's crazy I think that
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:57,247	| IOT019 |	The cost will go down with you
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:01,599	| IOT019 |	With a supply chain unit when the microwave
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:02,111	| IOT019 |	Enough
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:04,671	| IOT019 |	Wildly expensive and
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:06,207	| IOT019 |	Now you know
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:07,231	| IOT019 |	It's one of those things that
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:12,095	| IOT019 |	You can buy a cheap one at Sears for $80 on sale
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:15,935	| IOT019 |	Amanda has been one of the most revolutionary
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:17,215	| IOT019 |	You know inventions

EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:23,359	| IOT019 |	What are you doing as a research Chef
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:25,407	| IOT019 |	At June so Lake
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:28,479	| IOT019 |	If I bought a June oven when it comes out next year
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:31,039	| IOT019 |	Are you are you the guy training the AI
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:33,855	| IOT019 |	I am yes
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:37,951	| IOT019 |	Think about that I'd be cooking
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:38,975	| IOT019 |	Dinner for you
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:40,767	| IOT019 |	Every night if you were using the gym
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:43,583	| IOT019 |	You certainly wouldn't be doing it every time
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:44,351	| IOT019 |	Because I'm lazy
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:48,191	| IOT019 |	Well maybe not
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:49,983	| IOT019 |	What are the things that we have to do is
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:51,263	| IOT019 |	Because people
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:53,055	| IOT019 |	Super tired and excited
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:55,615	| IOT019 |	I craving this eat that
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:57,919	| IOT019 |	Might be something where one night you're like
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:59,711	| IOT019 |	I just finished for the chicken breast
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:00,991	| IOT019 |	And that
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:02,015	| IOT019 |	Chef Ryan
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:03,295	| IOT019 |	Cook for me and then
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:07,391	| IOT019 |	You know on a Friday or Saturday night you might say you know what I want to get in
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:10,207	| IOT019 |	To be controlling the 7th and
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:12,767	| IOT019 |	Chef Ryan
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:14,559	| IOT019 |	What do you have to tell me not to call you
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:17,375	| IOT019 |	Canadian nickname I do not vent
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:20,703	| IOT019 |	Chef Ryan and Spider-Man
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:22,239	| IOT019 |	I'm going to toss him so much
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:24,799	| IOT019 |	Some veggies and some apples and
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:27,359	| IOT019 |	The parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:27,871	| IOT019 |	Let's go
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:29,407	| IOT019 |	And it'll be like
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:29,919	| IOT019 |	I don't do that
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:32,223	| IOT019 |	So so what have you got
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:33,759	| IOT019 |	What if you got cooking
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:35,039	| IOT019 |	Be safe
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:36,063	| IOT019 |	Really sucks
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:38,879	| IOT019 |	I'm designing the cook settings for the computer vision
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:40,927	| IOT019 |	Right now
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:41,695	| IOT019 |	We
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:45,535	| IOT019 |	Have the ability to recognize 15 different food items
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:46,303	| IOT019 |	And
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:48,607	| IOT019 |	What I'm doing every day it is

EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:53,215	| IOT019 |	I might be cooking
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:56,287	| IOT019 |	Cookies in a day
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:59,359	| IOT019 |	Or 15 batches of cinnamon

EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:01,919	| IOT019 |	Testing the oven
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:04,479	| IOT019 |	I'm seeing how long it takes
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:08,063	| IOT019 |	For salmon to cook at 350 degrees
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:11,903	| IOT019 |	Lighting all of that data
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:14,463	| IOT019 |	So we can come up with the ideal
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:15,487	| IOT019 |	Exciting
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:18,815	| IOT019 |	As we started tiling
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:19,839	| IOT019 |	Thailand
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:21,631	| IOT019 |	And really mastering these
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:23,679	| IOT019 |	Computer vision
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:25,471	| IOT019 |	I'm going to
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:28,799	| IOT019 |	Work on designing actual recipe that we recommend
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:34,687	| IOT019 |	It's almost like we have two different companies like
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:36,223	| IOT019 |	Thursday Hardware
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:38,015	| IOT019 |	June oven
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:39,039	| IOT019 |	Products
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:39,551	| IOT019 |	And there's a
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:42,111	| IOT019 |	Jus recipe which is just
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:44,415	| IOT019 |	And it's just as big a part of it
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:46,975	| IOT019 |	Designing
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:47,999	| IOT019 |	Recipes dinner
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:51,071	| IOT019 |	For our products
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:53,631	| IOT019 |	And John within that will have
EDL	00:44:53,631	00:44:55,679	| IOT019 |	Really beautiful photography
EDL	00:44:56,191	00:44:58,495	| IOT019 |	And instructional videos like right now
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:00,031	| IOT019 |	Using
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:04,639	| IOT019 |	Extended maybe 12-minute long
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:05,407	| IOT019 |	Cooking video
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:10,527	| IOT019 |	Everyday is just like constantly collaborating with the hardware and software
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:13,855	| IOT019 |	Improvement
EDL	00:45:14,367	00:45:19,487	| IOT019 |	This is something that just popped in my head as you were saying this but what happens when they do a software update
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:26,399	| IOT019 |	Do they confer with you because like if they do is certain kind of software update could it like totally throw off your cooking time
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:27,679	| IOT019 |	Times and estimates for Lake
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:28,191	| IOT019 |	Salmon
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:31,775	| IOT019 |	Control all of my oven
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:32,799	| IOT019 |	Using
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:35,359	| IOT019 |	Do you turn on my computer so I
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:36,639	| IOT019 |	I'm writing command line
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:38,431	| IOT019 |	Control the oven
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:39,199	| IOT019 |	Wichita
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:41,247	| IOT019 |	I never ever thought I would
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:43,039	| IOT019 |	Ever do like writing code
EDL	00:45:45,855	00:45:47,647	| IOT019 |	Yes
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:50,719	| IOT019 |	Campfire cooking
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:56,351	| IOT019 |	Burien shooting like you roast a s'more like you're cooking a marshmallow into like a light like burning too much
EDL	00:45:56,863	00:45:58,143	| IOT019 |	And you move here
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:46:00,447	| IOT019 |	Your hand in the stick away from the fire
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:01,983	| IOT019 |	And the same thing except
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:07,103	| IOT019 |	Lower the heat on
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:08,383	| IOT019 |	The oven
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:09,919	| IOT019 |	It's incredibly cool
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:12,479	| IOT019 |	I never in a million years thought I'd be
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:14,783	| IOT019 |	At my computer you know
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:15,295	| IOT019 |	Commanding
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:17,087	| IOT019 |	Five different oven
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:22,719	| IOT019 |	Yes
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:25,791	| IOT019 |	A lot of the software
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:28,351	| IOT019 |	I'll be giving the software engineers
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:32,191	| IOT019 |	The settings based on the command line
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:34,495	| IOT019 |	So it really weird that you know there's
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:36,799	| IOT019 |	A synchronicity between
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:38,847	| IOT019 |	Design and the software
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:40,383	| IOT019 |	Okay
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:43,455	| IOT019 |	Yeah I know I was just suddenly thinking of Michael what happens if
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:44,735	| IOT019 |	Cuz I would be
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:46,271	| IOT019 |	Okay

EDL	00:46:57,791	00:47:02,143	| IOT019 |	CDA I I don't even know what the results of this will be
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:04,703	| IOT019 |	But I wish I were there on cookie baking day
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:05,471	| IOT019 |	Probably salmon
