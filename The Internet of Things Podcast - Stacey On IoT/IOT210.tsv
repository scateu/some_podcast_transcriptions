EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,464	| IOT210 |	Hey this week
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,744	| IOT210 |	I am in Stockholm
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:10,560	| IOT210 |	Last week was Helsinki this week is Stockholm
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,352	| IOT210 |	So much
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,888	| IOT210 |	Fun I should be though
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:14,912	| IOT210 |	In Hanover
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:16,960	| IOT210 |	Actually try but it's too hard to get
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:18,496	| IOT210 |	A ticket
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:20,288	| IOT210 |	It was crazy expensive and then plates
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,592	| IOT210 |	And hotels were sold out it was
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:25,664	| IOT210 |	I never realized how big
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:27,712	| IOT210 |	Hannover Messi is
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,224	| IOT210 |	Is actually
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:32,064	| IOT210 |	Bigger than CES
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,088	| IOT210 |	Ncees
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:34,368	| IOT210 |	And
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,136	| IOT210 |	It is
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,160	| IOT210 |	Crazy in this
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:40,000	| IOT210 |	Actually in the last five or so years we've seen more and more
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:40,768	| IOT210 |	It come
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:43,840	| IOT210 |	Companies going to CES it really ramping up their presences
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,888	| IOT210 |	Starting probably
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:46,656	| IOT210 |	Actually it was
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,192	| IOT210 |	2014
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:48,704	| IOT210 |	2015
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:50,496	| IOT210 |	2016
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,288	| IOT210 |	Microsoft CEO Saatchi
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,312	| IOT210 |	Nutella actually gave it
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:54,080	| IOT210 |	Keno
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:58,432	| IOT210 |	This year we saw the biggest Trends coming out of this world
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,968	| IOT210 |	Probably 5G
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,760	| IOT210 |	Inland Industrial
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:05,600	| IOT210 |	Libation and this isn't just because I care about these things it's because those are the hottest
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,648	| IOT210 |	Qualcomm was a
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,696	| IOT210 |	Big vendor this year they did
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,488	| IOT210 |	Cool 5G
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:12,768	| IOT210 |	Pavilion
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,304	| IOT210 |	Where they set up a
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:17,120	| IOT210 |	5G Network and had several companies
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:19,168	| IOT210 |	Using that that work for things like
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,448	| IOT210 |	Autonomous
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:21,472	| IOT210 |	Vehicle that was
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,752	| IOT210 |	Hopefully operated
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,520	| IOT210 |	I know
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:25,824	| IOT210 |	Autonomous vehicles and remote operators what is that
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:28,384	| IOT210 |	It's basically when the autonomous vehicle doesn't
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,432	| IOT210 |	Remote operator takes over
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:32,480	| IOT210 |	But that was operating over if I cheat
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:37,856	| IOT210 |	They are GE Network right now
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:39,136	| IOT210 |	It was a joke at work
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:43,232	| IOT210 |	If you and I couldn't bring are 5G capable phones
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,768	| IOT210 |	Those exist now
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:48,096	| IOT210 |	I know they've been showed I don't know if they're actually being sold
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:54,752	| IOT210 |	Yes yes I know Samsung has a 5G phone that they've announcement shown I don't think you can buy any
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,800	| IOT210 |	True 5G phones yet
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,824	| IOT210 |	Gabby we don't care
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:58,848	| IOT210 |	Because this is industrial
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:03:59,872	| IOT210 |	So
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:02,432	| IOT210 |	We saw a video transfers over
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:06,016	| IOT210 |	5G Network so this is HD video we saw a machine control
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,040	| IOT210 |	So lots of
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:11,904	| IOT210 |	Robot arms Kuka was showing some stuff with their robot arms for wireless control with them
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:13,184	| IOT210 |	And
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,208	| IOT210 |	We also
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:15,744	| IOT210 |	Sausage stuffer
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,536	| IOT210 |	ABB
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,815	| IOT210 |	Basically all the big names
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:20,863	| IOT210 |	Orit robot
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:22,911	| IOT210 |	Except for your name
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:23,935	| IOT210 |	Except for my name
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,215	| IOT210 |	Which I wouldn't expect
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,751	| IOT210 |	Because I wasn't there next year
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:31,615	| IOT210 |	I'm going I'm going to book early so I can actually get my stuff
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:32,895	| IOT210 |	So
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:35,967	| IOT210 |	Some things that happen though that are worth mentioning for everyone
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:42,111	| IOT210 |	Is Microsoft and the BMW group they launched something called the open Manufacturing
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:42,879	| IOT210 |	Program
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:44,159	| IOT210 |	And you guys might be like
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,671	| IOT210 |	Blah blah
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:46,719	| IOT210 |	But you should
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:48,255	| IOT210 |	Here's why
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:52,095	| IOT210 |	This is an open standard that Microsoft in BMW recruiting
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:54,911	| IOT210 |	It will also work with the reference Frame Works from
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,191	| IOT210 |	Different standards group
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:58,239	| IOT210 |	Call Dentistry for. O which is a bigger
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,007	| IOT210 |	European standards
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,311	| IOT210 |	Holden manufacturing plant
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:02,847	| IOT210 |	They're trying
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:04,383	| IOT210 |	How to create a smart Factory
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:04,895	| IOT210 |	Tree platform
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:05,919	| IOT210 |	Ties back
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,455	| IOT210 |	Azure
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:10,527	| IOT210 |	And it's basically reference designs that BMWs
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,551	| IOT210 |	Contributing to the splat
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:13,855	| IOT210 |	Form in what's important here
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:17,695	| IOT210 |	These quote-unquote open platforms are really reference
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:20,511	| IOT210 |	And the reference architectures that used for
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,023	| IOT210 |	Particular
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,303	| IOT210 |	Solutions
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,071	| IOT210 |	So
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:25,375	| IOT210 |	Particular software particular cloud backup
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,399	| IOT210 |	Cans and they make it really easy
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:33,823	| IOT210 |	This is not an open effort in the sense that they're creating a standard that makes it easy to like move or cloud
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,591	| IOT210 |	The cloud Iran
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:37,407	| IOT210 |	Get data from different machines at different places this is
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:39,199	| IOT210 |	I'm just going to say this a lot of Market
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,991	| IOT210 |	It is valuable
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:43,551	| IOT210 |	Because a lot of these companies do not
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,063	| IOT210 |	Have
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:45,855	| IOT210 |	Expertise
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,391	| IOT210 |	Pulling together it
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:50,463	| IOT210 |	So they can just go and pick up a reference to
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:58,399	| IOT210 |	Right yes and this is actually related to something that was in your newsletter last week prior to Hannover Messe
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:04,799	| IOT210 |	Microsoft announced a bunch of azure for industrial iot advancements with their so
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:08,383	| IOT210 |	Security Center for iot Azure Sentinel as your IP hub
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:11,967	| IOT210 |	And ironically also in the newsletter
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:13,247	| IOT210 |	Very similar
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:18,367	| IOT210 |	Announcement was made but not with Microsoft it was Volkswagen teaming up with Amazon
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:21,183	| IOT210 |	For AWS iot services
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,719	| IOT210 |	And Amazon's going to power
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:24,255	| IOT210 |	Volkswagens industrial cloud
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:28,095	| IOT210 |	To integrate like 30,000 facilities in 1500 supplier so
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,887	| IOT210 |	It's like everybody's trying to
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,423	| IOT210 |	Aggregator
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:37,311	| IOT210 |	Production now with coyote McCloud so that it seems like the fight is on between these big cloud companies
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:40,127	| IOT210 |	Yes and I will say that Microsoft has been
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,663	| IOT210 |	Way ahead of Amazon
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,455	| IOT210 |	Google I don't even think they can
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:44,223	| IOT210 |	OK Google
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,735	| IOT210 |	Cloud in the
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:49,343	| IOT210 |	But Microsoft has really done a lot of work Packaging
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:50,623	| IOT210 |	And hand-holding
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,927	| IOT210 |	Solutions for
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,439	| IOT210 |	Industrial
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:57,023	| IOT210 |	And it shows because they are by far and away
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:02,655	| IOT210 |	And they're basically just digging in
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:07,519	| IOT210 |	An offering more and more features they've taken a page from AWS in the terms of
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,311	| IOT210 |	Saying hey what are people building
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,591	| IOT210 |	Oh
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,639	| IOT210 |	We should offer that is a particular feature
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:15,455	| IOT210 |	And in really repackaging things in Perry
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,759	| IOT210 |	Easy to implement
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:20,575	| IOT210 |	Ways for different industry verticals
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,111	| IOT210 |	So I want to give them props here
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:23,647	| IOT210 |	It's a big
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:27,231	| IOT210 |	Amazon's less awesome at that but I think they're going
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:31,071	| IOT210 |	Get more awesome and I would say also Amazon has the
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,095	| IOT210 |	Developer base
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:33,375	| IOT210 |	Demeans people can't
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,935	| IOT210 |	There plenty of Developers
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:38,751	| IOT210 |	Who are working with in Amazon to build iot Solutions
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,543	| IOT210 |	Instead of working from
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:42,079	| IOT210 |	Particular reference framework
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:42,847	| IOT210 |	The people of design
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,383	| IOT210 |	They're just like
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,151	| IOT210 |	Make it ourselves
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,431	| IOT210 |	And that's what
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:50,783	| IOT210 |	So that's kind of maybe the battle to look at is Developers
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:53,087	| IOT210 |	Versus pre-packaged solutions that
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:53,599	| IOT210 |	Big giant Corp
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:56,927	| IOT210 |	There's also
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:59,487	| IOT210 |	The open industry for. LOL
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:07:59,999	| IOT210 |	Swiss
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:02,815	| IOT210 |	And this is a group of European
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,583	| IOT210 |	Companies
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,607	| IOT210 |	Including
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,399	| IOT210 |	Who got the robotics manufacturer
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,679	| IOT210 |	And sap
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,959	| IOT210 |	And they are
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:10,751	| IOT210 |	Basically trying to
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:13,055	| IOT210 |	Build an operating system
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,871	| IOT210 |	In an open operating system ecosystem
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,943	| IOT210 |	4 connected robots and
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:19,967	| IOT210 |	Connected processing
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:21,503	| IOT210 |	This is not new
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,527	| IOT210 |	There's a bunch of effort
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:24,319	| IOT210 |	It's like this they're usually offender
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,599	| IOT210 |	Specific
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:28,415	| IOT210 |	But here what they've done is they've created a network of
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,719	| IOT210 |	Couple different suppliers
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,231	| IOT210 |	Again
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:35,583	| IOT210 |	Putting the word open in your name putting the word Alliance does not
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,375	| IOT210 |	Necessarily mean that it is open
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| IOT210 |	And that everyone
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,423	| IOT210 |	Use it or
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,983	| IOT210 |	Want to use it there's always the danger of login
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,263	| IOT210 |	There is a
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,079	| IOT210 |	Definite Trend we're seeing happened here which is
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:49,151	| IOT210 |	Probably 20 years ago when you were in the it
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:49,663	| IOT210 |	SeaWorld
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,711	| IOT210 |	You saw these things proliferate
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,503	| IOT210 |	And then
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:59,135	| IOT210 |	With the launch of virtualization and services like AWS we actually saw that
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:00,159	| IOT210 |	Whole underlying
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,719	| IOT210 |	Computing architecture
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,023	| IOT210 |	And even solution base
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,815	| IOT210 |	Get kind of
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:08,607	| IOT210 |	People developed apis people
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,911	| IOT210 |	Developer platforms and services
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:13,983	| IOT210 |	It made it a lot easier to create offerings for differ
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,775	| IOT210 |	Letters and Interpol them all together
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,079	| IOT210 |	In a way that let you
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:18,847	| IOT210 |	Pick and choose
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,127	| IOT210 |	A little bit more
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:20,639	| IOT210 |	Breezly and worried
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,175	| IOT210 |	There still.
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:24,479	| IOT210 |	But theoretically
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:24,991	| IOT210 |	You could get around
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,855	| IOT210 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,647	| IOT210 |	These days the big companies are
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:34,719	| IOT210 |	It's not that they're ignoring standards for their just creating their own
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:37,791	| IOT210 |	I think or maybe in parallel with existing standards
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,839	| IOT210 |	But it is a different world
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:42,655	| IOT210 |	Nit and iot than it was 20 years ago for sure
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,191	| IOT210 |	Iot
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,215	| IOT210 |	Will mature
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,239	| IOT210 |	It's just less mature
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,031	| IOT210 |	Are the stands now so that
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:48,543	| IOT210 |	It makes sense
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:53,919	| IOT210 |	Okay so we talked about 5G we talked about various open platform
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,431	| IOT210 |	And
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:55,967	| IOT210 |	The other thing
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,015	| IOT210 |	It's kind of a tangent with 5G
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,551	| IOT210 |	But I did want to mention this
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,599	| IOT210 |	Wireless
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,879	| IOT210 |	Is also
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,391	| IOT210 |	A big trend
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:09,279	| IOT210 |	And it may not be 5G it might be proprietary Wireless but we are seeing a lot
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,559	| IOT210 |	Of companies
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:11,839	| IOT210 |	Creating
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:16,447	| IOT210 |	Either private 5G or private proprietary networks for the industrial iot
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:18,495	| IOT210 |	This is new because
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,031	| IOT210 |	Historically
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:22,847	| IOT210 |	Factory environments are really crappy for wireless
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,895	| IOT210 |	Lots of metal objects run
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,663	| IOT210 |	Hang around
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:28,735	| IOT210 |	There lots of security concerns about someone being able to
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:31,807	| IOT210 |	Talk to a robotic arm and use it for ill
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:32,575	| IOT210 |	And
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,599	| IOT210 |	There are latency issue
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,391	| IOT210 |	So
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:38,719	| IOT210 |	5G will address some of this other Wireless standards have
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,999	| IOT210 |	Already happened
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:44,095	| IOT210 |	To address this but we're going to see more and more factories
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:44,863	| IOT210 |	Total Wireless
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:47,167	| IOT210 |	And like I said in my newsletter last week
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:49,983	| IOT210 |	Actually opens up a lot of interesting opportunities around
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,263	| IOT210 |	Agility in the fact
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:53,823	| IOT210 |	Tree floor in the ability to customize things
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:55,359	| IOT210 |	Customized Manufacturing
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:57,151	| IOT210 |	Processes for differ
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:58,175	| IOT210 |	Products in Boots
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:58,943	| IOT210 |	Things about
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,479	| IOT210 |	So I think it's going to be kind of cool
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,527	| IOT210 |	That was a lot
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:07,647	| IOT210 |	It's a big show it's a big show we just summarized like all of it
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,439	| IOT210 |	Sore quickly
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:13,279	| IOT210 |	Let's move away from Hannover Germany and into
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,047	| IOT210 |	News
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:15,071	| IOT210 |	From Walmart
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,375	| IOT210 |	Walmart to
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,655	| IOT210 |	I think
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:21,471	| IOT210 |	Before this news are about to talk about I think
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:22,239	| IOT210 |	Could voice
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:26,591	| IOT210 |	Order things from Walmart possibly through Google Express which is
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:28,127	| IOT210 |	Not something I use
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:30,175	| IOT210 |	Now Walmart is introducing
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,479	| IOT210 |	What they called Walmart voice
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:32,991	| IOT210 |	Order
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:35,551	| IOT210 |	So they have integrated
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:38,367	| IOT210 |	They're saying they're going to integrate across platforms
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:40,671	| IOT210 |	With multiple partners but the first one is
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:41,183	| IOT210 |	Google
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:46,815	| IOT210 |	And basically you will be able to order things or put things in your Walmart shopping card
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:49,887	| IOT210 |	To your Google home devices in the Google Assistant
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:55,007	| IOT210 |	And then. You do that over the course of a couple days perhaps
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:58,335	| IOT210 |	And then you say okay I'm ready to check out now and
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,127	| IOT210 |	You're good to go you
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,663	| IOT210 |	Purchase all your items
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:07,551	| IOT210 |	So this isn't quite new I think it's more of a revamp or refocus a little bit
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:11,135	| IOT210 |	So with you could do reordering
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,183	| IOT210 |	Through Google Express
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:13,951	| IOT210 |	Quit Walmart
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:15,743	| IOT210 |	What's up what you could voice reorder products
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,815	| IOT210 |	It went through the Google Express platform
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,583	| IOT210 |	On your Google
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:22,143	| IOT210 |	And now basically this is
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:22,911	| IOT210 |	Better in a
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:23,679	| IOT210 |	Migration on the
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:26,495	| IOT210 |	It's not through Google Express and
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,031	| IOT210 |	It has that
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:30,335	| IOT210 |	You just were talking about this ability to learn
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,431	| IOT210 |	Yep
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:38,271	| IOT210 |	So it's rolling out slowly but rolling out now so you should
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:43,135	| IOT210 |	See something come to your Google Assistant with Walmart tablet saying that's coming weeks
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:47,999	| IOT210 |	Yeah I think this will be interesting to watch him very I don't actually do a lot of voice ordering on the
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:48,767	| IOT210 |	Amazon books
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:54,399	| IOT210 |	Cuz you people do that's the thing when you look at all these reports and charts to come out of recorder
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:13:01,311	| IOT210 |	Voice ordering with shopping is still very low on the list of activities
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:07,455	| IOT210 |	Reason why is I will tell it to reorder it like a good option would be my arc I get these dog toothbrush bones Bass
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:10,783	| IOT210 |	Play for my dog and I ordered them all the time I have a virtual Dash
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:14,367	| IOT210 |	So I would like to be able to like Amazon reorder this
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,903	| IOT210 |	Spy on Amazon
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:19,487	| IOT210 |	There's like four different prices for the same size properties
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:23,839	| IOT210 |	Sometimes it defaults to the highest price sometimes it doesn't but I don't feel comfortable doing that
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:26,143	| IOT210 |	Right and then the other thing is I have to say the product
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,423	| IOT210 |	Exactly
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:27,935	| IOT210 |	Perfectly every time
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:30,751	| IOT210 |	This particular partnership addresses
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,519	| IOT210 |	Both of those
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:34,079	| IOT210 |	Concerns when it learns what I'm actually ordering
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:37,663	| IOT210 |	To my hope is that Walmart only has one price for
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:39,455	| IOT210 |	For these items so if I like this price
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:41,759	| IOT210 |	I can just be like yes I don't have
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:42,527	| IOT210 |	Double check
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:48,671	| IOT210 |	Right and price comparisons using voice is not ideal in my experience
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:51,743	| IOT210 |	No it's terrible cuz you can't even tell
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,511	| IOT210 |	Cheapest kids
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,023	| IOT210 |	On Amazon
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,071	| IOT210 |	Okay then you'll get it
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:55,839	| IOT210 |	7 weeks
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,655	| IOT210 |	You won't get exactly what you
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,447	| IOT210 |	So that's good
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,983	| IOT210 |	Amazon. Does
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:03,007	| IOT210 |	What kind of a fun
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,847	| IOT210 |	They do have a fun patent
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,127	| IOT210 |	We spoke about
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:10,687	| IOT210 |	Drone deliveries I believe it was in Australia
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:12,991	| IOT210 |	A couple weeks ago on the show
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:17,855	| IOT210 |	And people were a little upset because the Drone noise for the deliveries
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:20,927	| IOT210 |	Was basically causing issues with pets
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:23,743	| IOT210 |	And I've seen that before with my dog because these drums
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:28,351	| IOT210 |	Ultrasonic frequencies that we can hear but animals can
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:32,447	| IOT210 |	And then there's just the regular drone noise that's kind of a buzz and annoying to all of us
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:33,727	| IOT210 |	So
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:37,055	| IOT210 |	Amazon file for patent back in 2016 but
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,591	| IOT210 |	Was just granted it this week
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:41,151	| IOT210 |	And it should address the
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:45,247	| IOT210 |	Drum noise problem to a large extent if they ever implemented
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:51,647	| IOT210 |	The idea is that their delivery drones would have an inflatable balloon in the and the Drone will take off
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:54,207	| IOT210 |	With your product from the warehouse it will come to your house
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:56,255	| IOT210 |	But then the balloon will inflate
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:15:03,167	| IOT210 |	And that's the mechanism that the Drone will descend with so you won't hear the drum noise because it won't
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:09,567	| IOT210 |	Using its propellers of that point would be using the balloon to come down and then the balloon would re-inflate to go
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:12,383	| IOT210 |	Make the Drone go back up so I presume there's some
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,151	| IOT210 |	Helium
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:16,479	| IOT210 |	Tank in this drum to refill the balloon
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:20,063	| IOT210 |	It's rather interesting it's a clever solution to a real problem
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:22,623	| IOT210 |	Imagine it's not helium helium is actually
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,903	| IOT210 |	I imagine it's he
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,415	| IOT210 |	When it just
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,207	| IOT210 |	I don't know
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,487	| IOT210 |	I know it has to be
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:32,095	| IOT210 |	Something lighter than typical are asked to be enough of it to
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:35,935	| IOT210 |	Carry enough weight so I don't know we're very concerned about
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:36,703	| IOT210 |	Supplies Outlet
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:41,311	| IOT210 |	This is where a little bit of knowledge that you very little good
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,359	| IOT210 |	Yeah I'm all for that I hate the sound of drones
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,151	| IOT210 |	Innocent
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,687	| IOT210 |	You Kevin
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:47,967	| IOT210 |	Have discovered
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,479	| IOT210 |	Something
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:53,599	| IOT210 |	Before we get to that should we talk about your Discovery first or should we talk about
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,367	| IOT210 |	The
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:54,879	| IOT210 |	Other people's stuff
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:16:00,767	| IOT210 |	Let's talk about the other people's discover these are very related items so earlier this week
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:03,327	| IOT210 |	Android police notice
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:03,839	| IOT210 |	That
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,631	| IOT210 |	On the Google
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:08,447	| IOT210 |	Storefronts the online storefront
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:12,031	| IOT210 |	Taking their connected devices are they were showing something called The Nest
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:12,799	| IOT210 |	Hub
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:14,335	| IOT210 |	Max witch
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:16,383	| IOT210 |	Obviously has not been announced or we would have been talking about it
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:20,735	| IOT210 |	This is supposed to be according to the images and what was leaked
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:26,367	| IOT210 |	On the storefront it's no longer there obviously this is supposed to be a 10 inch smart display
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:28,159	| IOT210 |	With a nest camera
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:30,719	| IOT210 |	So you would not only be able to make
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:34,047	| IOT210 |	Video calls on Duo on the nest hubmax
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:37,887	| IOT210 |	But then you could keep an eye on things at home we could build a nest cam
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,935	| IOT210 |	Get your motion and sound alerts
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:44,287	| IOT210 |	Also supposed to have stereo speakers so something I guess
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:48,127	| IOT210 |	I guess something similar to our Google home hubs little 7in
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:49,919	| IOT210 |	Smart display
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:51,199	| IOT210 |	And the Google
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:55,295	| IOT210 |	What's the speaker the Google home Max
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,087	| IOT210 |	Google home Max
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,135	| IOT210 |	The big speaker
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:01,183	| IOT210 |	The big speaker like the $400 speaker
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:03,487	| IOT210 |	It sounds like a combination of those two products
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:07,583	| IOT210 |	If it's legit and considering it was actually on Google site
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,119	| IOT210 |	Yeah I think somebody hit the
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,399	| IOT210 |	Publish this page
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,935	| IOT210 |	Button a little too soon
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:12,703	| IOT210 |	So
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:15,519	| IOT210 |	We don't know anything else about it but presumably
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,543	| IOT210 |	If it's a real
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,567	| IOT210 |	Really coming tomorrow
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:19,615	| IOT210 |	I'm thinking I owe next month
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,151	| IOT210 |	Good time to make that an hour
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:22,687	| IOT210 |	And then
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:25,247	| IOT210 |	Website although
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,295	| IOT210 |	Maybe a little more clandestine
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,343	| IOT210 |	Kevin you did some digging into
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,111	| IOT210 |	Discovered
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:36,511	| IOT210 |	I discovered many many references to a color a board not a device because
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:39,583	| IOT210 |	Is Google names all of the boards for its products
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:42,399	| IOT210 |	Not the devices pick the code name for a boards
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,935	| IOT210 |	Was spotted in
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:50,079	| IOT210 |	The chromium commit log which is open source so that's why it's all available to the public is where I find out all the Chromebook news
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,383	| IOT210 |	The name of the board is called Mistral
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:55,199	| IOT210 |	And to clarify we should say
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:58,783	| IOT210 |	So when Kevin says bored most of you know this but if you don't
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:01,599	| IOT210 |	It is a collection of it is a physical
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:04,159	| IOT210 |	Board with chips on it that is used
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:07,487	| IOT210 |	Slap that into a product and connect all the connectors and then poop
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,255	| IOT210 |	You have
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:10,303	| IOT210 |	Computer or smart display or thermostat or whatever
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,863	| IOT210 |	Or whatever it might be correct
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:13,631	| IOT210 |	Correct
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:18,495	| IOT210 |	So Mistral has a mini code references to the recently announced
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:19,519	| IOT210 |	I'll come
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:22,079	| IOT210 |	Qcs 400s Oasys
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:25,919	| IOT210 |	And why is that important or relevant well that is
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,687	| IOT210 |	Outcomes
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:31,551	| IOT210 |	New AI enabled soc for smart speakers and
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:33,087	| IOT210 |	Digital assistants
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,623	| IOT210 |	An AV receivers
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,647	| IOT210 |	And it has
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:41,279	| IOT210 |	Mesh Wi-Fi capabilities Bluetooth LE mesh capabilities on device
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:42,815	| IOT210 |	Voice recognition
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,119	| IOT210 |	As well as a zigbee radios
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:49,727	| IOT210 |	I kind of put two and two and two together
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:52,799	| IOT210 |	Looks to me like all these code references
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:56,383	| IOT210 |	Indicate Google is working on a new
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:59,967	| IOT210 |	Either smart display or smart speaker or both
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,503	| IOT210 |	Because one of the chips
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,527	| IOT210 |	Has a GPU
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,807	| IOT210 |	The Qualcomm has
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:05,855	| IOT210 |	Created one of those not so
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:08,159	| IOT210 |	They could go either way here and I
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:08,671	| IOT210 |	Eating
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:10,719	| IOT210 |	It really sucks to me
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:13,535	| IOT210 |	Google's combining its Google Home Products
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,815	| IOT210 |	And possibly a Google
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:19,423	| IOT210 |	Wi-Fi product which is something I'd said they should do and also
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:23,263	| IOT210 |	Likely or at least possible that this could actually be a
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:26,079	| IOT210 |	True Hub at try radio hub with
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,103	| IOT210 |	Li-fi
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:28,639	| IOT210 |	Bluetooth and zigbee
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:33,759	| IOT210 |	So lots of unknowns here but I do know they're working actively on
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:34,271	| IOT210 |	A product
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:36,831	| IOT210 |	Will we see it I don't know
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:38,623	| IOT210 |	Will it be what I think it is
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,647	| IOT210 |	Again I don't know
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:45,279	| IOT210 |	But it is definitely something to look forward to I do not think this would be in time for next month's
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:49,119	| IOT210 |	Google IO I think this would be more of a fall announcement with their
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:52,447	| IOT210 |	Typical pixel products that they do roughly September October
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:55,263	| IOT210 |	And with a zippy radio
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,031	| IOT210 |	Couple things
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:59,615	| IOT210 |	Amazon has their Echo Plus which combines
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:02,175	| IOT210 |	A tri-band radio so Bluetooth WiFi and zigbee
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,967	| IOT210 |	For smartphone control
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:07,039	| IOT210 |	It does not act as a Wi-Fi router
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:09,855	| IOT210 |	It did bite
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,623	| IOT210 |	Euro so maybe
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,135	| IOT210 |	That's coming
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,487	| IOT210 |	Mississippi Braves
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:17,279	| IOT210 |	Could also be
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:18,559	| IOT210 |	Thread
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:20,863	| IOT210 |	Because they both use the same underlying
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:22,911	| IOT210 |	For the radio
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:25,983	| IOT210 |	So is the point is this
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:29,055	| IOT210 |	Define predefined Zippy or could it be possibly threat
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:30,335	| IOT210 |	Is it yours it just 802.
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:38,015	| IOT210 |	That's a good question and just the fact that there is a CD radio on this SOC doesn't mean they'll use it
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:40,575	| IOT210 |	That's true there was a CB radio in the Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,623	| IOT210 |	ASAP I said they never
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:44,927	| IOT210 |	So
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:46,975	| IOT210 |	That is true
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:49,535	| IOT210 |	By the way and then this is just a little
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:51,839	| IOT210 |	I don't know maybe it will be on Jeopardy someday
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:53,631	| IOT210 |	Do you know what a Mistral is
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,167	| IOT210 |	Do a mystery
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,191	| IOT210 |	Is it a bird straw-like
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:21:00,287	| IOT210 |	No it's a strong cold north-westerly wind that
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:02,335	| IOT210 |	Those through southern France
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:03,615	| IOT210 |	Meaning in winter
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:05,151	| IOT210 |	Why do I bring that up
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:08,991	| IOT210 |	Because the code name of the board and Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:10,015	| IOT210 |	Is Gail
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:11,295	| IOT210 |	G a l e
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:13,087	| IOT210 |	Oh
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,623	| IOT210 |	Wi-Fi with the wind theme
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,416	| IOT210 |	I like yes
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:21,536	| IOT210 |	I wish I knew more power Regional wind
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,816	| IOT210 |	I'm like yeah I'm
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:24,608	| IOT210 |	They're good at parties to people
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:26,400	| IOT210 |	And that's all I know
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,240	| IOT210 |	But okay
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:33,824	| IOT210 |	There's a theme there we'll see if we see any cool
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:35,872	| IOT210 |	Google home hubs that's good news
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,408	| IOT210 |	Because I do think
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:40,480	| IOT210 |	We need to see continuing innovation
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,808	| IOT210 |	And let us move on
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,600	| IOT210 |	To something we probably don't talk
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,624	| IOT210 |	Enough about
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:47,648	| IOT210 |	Which is
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:49,440	| IOT210 |	Surveillance
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:53,536	| IOT210 |	I didn't mean to make my voice sound all robotic
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:54,560	| IOT210 |	Keep it kind of did
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:57,376	| IOT210 |	So The Intercept published the story about
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:59,168	| IOT210 |	Sidewalk Labs which is
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:01,216	| IOT210 |	One of alphabets independent companies
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:02,496	| IOT210 |	Doing smart cities efforts
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:04,032	| IOT210 |	And
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,824	| IOT210 |	They actually
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:08,128	| IOT210 |	I have a program called replica
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:10,176	| IOT210 |	They're offering two cities that shows
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:15,552	| IOT210 |	Basically how users are using city streets and where they're moving around in that sort of thing
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:18,112	| IOT210 |	What's noteworthy
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:20,160	| IOT210 |	Is the cities don't actually
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:22,208	| IOT210 |	Know where the state is coming from
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:22,976	| IOT210 |	Speculated is from
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,512	| IOT210 |	Cell phone data
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,792	| IOT210 |	They're probably right
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:28,352	| IOT210 |	This relates back to
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:28,864	| IOT210 |	Foursquare
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:31,424	| IOT210 |	Which showed off a product
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:35,264	| IOT210 |	Is a concept product at South by Southwest
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,544	| IOT210 |	But you see
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,824	| IOT210 |	Hot spots in the city
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:39,360	| IOT210 |	Of Austin
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:41,664	| IOT210 |	Based on people
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,688	| IOT210 |	Vocation
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:45,248	| IOT210 |	Around town and their cell phone location
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:49,088	| IOT210 |	What they were doing is Foursquare provides location infrastructure for
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,880	| IOT210 |	Apps like Twitter in Uber
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:54,976	| IOT210 |	So everybody's phone that has those apps on it basically is checking into
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,792	| IOT210 |	Wish I could handle for square butt for square noses
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:00,864	| IOT210 |	And so they were trying to aggregate that data
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:04,960	| IOT210 |	So if you were single person moving around it wasn't showing that data
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:06,752	| IOT210 |	But if someone
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:08,800	| IOT210 |	And a bunch of people were at 8
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:09,824	| IOT210 |	Place it would show
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:11,872	| IOT210 |	There's a lot of people right here
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,408	| IOT210 |	Anna's house
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:15,712	| IOT210 |	Kind of like what sidewalk slabs is off
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,480	| IOT210 |	Offering for
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:16,992	| IOT210 |	What's with replicas
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,272	| IOT210 |	Now
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,808	| IOT210 |	This is where it gets dicey
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,344	| IOT210 |	Like are we okay
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:21,856	| IOT210 |	With
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:24,160	| IOT210 |	This data being used in an
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:24,672	| IOT210 |	Aggregated
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:28,000	| IOT210 |	I would say yes as long as it doesn't
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,280	| IOT210 |	They don't
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,328	| IOT210 |	I would like the next track I know they're track
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:33,888	| IOT210 |	As long as they don't show individual
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:34,400	| IOT210 |	Pat's
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:36,960	| IOT210 |	Or I mean you can get a lot of
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:41,568	| IOT210 |	Personal information just from your device and I don't mean the personal data
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,360	| IOT210 |	What's your email and such I mean
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:49,760	| IOT210 |	Specific device identifiers that are tied to maybe your cell phone account for example so they have to be very careful
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:51,808	| IOT210 |	About what day do they collect here
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:53,088	| IOT210 |	It should all be at
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:53,856	| IOT210 |	Corrugated when they're showing
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:56,672	| IOT210 |	Because in this brings me back to like Strava and
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:57,952	| IOT210 |	Nets heatmap remembered
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:59,488	| IOT210 |	The year or two ago when they
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,768	| IOT210 |	Publisher keep mapping
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,584	| IOT210 |	You could see all Strava users
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,608	| IOT210 |	Were sharing location
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,680	| IOT210 |	You can see like
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,216	| IOT210 |	Oh hey there
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:13,824	| IOT210 |	A couple people using the sap running around in the middle of nowhere in the desert
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:14,592	| IOT210 |	Then people
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:15,360	| IOT210 |	Oh
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,640	| IOT210 |	That's a US Army base
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:19,712	| IOT210 |	Secret operations you have to
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:24,576	| IOT210 |	Implement something so if there are fewer than a hundred or I don't know what the no
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,088	| IOT210 |	Number is
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:27,136	| IOT210 |	That certain number of people in a
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:27,904	| IOT210 |	Location
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:28,672	| IOT210 |	You shouldn't show it
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,464	| IOT210 |	Outlier should be shown
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:32,512	| IOT210 |	You shouldn't be able to
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:34,048	| IOT210 |	Track one person's
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:34,816	| IOT210 |	Half through
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:35,584	| IOT210 |	For the day
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,096	| IOT210 |	End
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:37,888	| IOT210 |	As these things become
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,168	| IOT210 |	Boar
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:41,216	| IOT210 |	Useful than I would say they are useful
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:42,240	| IOT210 |	That's the other thing
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:47,616	| IOT210 |	I mean if I want to know how many people are at my favorite restaurant right now is
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,896	| IOT210 |	Is it busy right now
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:52,480	| IOT210 |	Different kind of information that would tell me that Google actually offers this
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:54,016	| IOT210 |	Google
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:56,576	| IOT210 |	You like search a restaurant and a location on your phone
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,600	| IOT210 |	Ashley sweet
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:59,136	| IOT210 |	Super busy
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:04,512	| IOT210 |	The other thing is it would be nice for against leaders to have access to the state of
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,280	| IOT210 |	4
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:09,632	| IOT210 |	People like if you're looking at an emergency room it would be really useful to see
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,424	| IOT210 |	Pads of
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:12,960	| IOT210 |	People
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:15,776	| IOT210 |	A places so people tracking is actually really important
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,104	| IOT210 |	It's just very difficult
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:21,408	| IOT210 |	Lot of places are trying to do a
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,432	| IOT210 |	Sensors mounted
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:24,480	| IOT210 |	Doorways and that's what
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:25,504	| IOT210 |	Best
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,040	| IOT210 |	So
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,064	| IOT210 |	Is this awesome
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:30,624	| IOT210 |	It's all in how it's implemented I think
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:33,440	| IOT210 |	Yammy Google could I have a really important data
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,208	| IOT210 |	Product to sell
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,024	| IOT210 |	Can you could even use cell phones as a
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:40,608	| IOT210 |	Can detect three ways does it is a means to detect traffic
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:43,936	| IOT210 |	Right you could use that you can sell that data to Lake
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:46,496	| IOT210 |	Companies for occupancy in for
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,008	| IOT210 |	Formation
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:48,032	| IOT210 |	Again
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:50,080	| IOT210 |	Depending on how it's used
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:52,896	| IOT210 |	So I have a very serious question
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:54,432	| IOT210 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:56,992	| IOT210 |	Does anybody use Foursquare anymore
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:57,504	| IOT210 |	You don't have to
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:06,208	| IOT210 |	Your app so I know in the in the background that I know a lot of apps do this yes
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:07,232	| IOT210 |	Realize necessarily
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:10,048	| IOT210 |	You realize it when Twitter put your location
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:18,496	| IOT210 |	Actually in like
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,776	| IOT210 |	You know if you're using Uber
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,312	| IOT210 |	Uber has to know where you are
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:24,896	| IOT210 |	And it's not magic now the fact that it's running all the time in the background
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,432	| IOT210 |	That's kind of
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:27,712	| IOT210 |	That could be disclosed
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:29,760	| IOT210 |	What's better and actually there was
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:32,064	| IOT210 |	This is a little bit different but there wasn't
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,088	| IOT210 |	SA
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:33,856	| IOT210 |	This week in the knee
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:34,624	| IOT210 |	Times about
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:36,160	| IOT210 |	Cell phone companies selling
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,208	| IOT210 |	Upset
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,000	| IOT210 |	No I don't know if that should go up to the airport
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:40,512	| IOT210 |	Patient level
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:43,072	| IOT210 |	Soda cell phone companies that are providing the
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:48,448	| IOT210 |	Physical Hardware should your applications failed to sell this data if your
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:49,728	| IOT210 |	Cell provider is it
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:56,128	| IOT210 |	I don't know I'd rather see it at the app level because consumers have more control in terms of permissions and
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:56,640	| IOT210 |	And so on
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:27:03,552	| IOT210 |	Just aggregated data that the carriers have I don't care that they sold me my device I'm paying for the device it's my device
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:05,344	| IOT210 |	I don't really want them
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,880	| IOT210 |	Getting into the space personally
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:10,208	| IOT210 |	That sounds okay
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:12,256	| IOT210 |	Now I don't trust any
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:13,536	| IOT210 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:16,864	| IOT210 |	She doesn't even shared her location with me
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:20,704	| IOT210 |	You don't know where I am actually got to know where I am in Stockholm
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,472	| IOT210 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:24,032	| IOT210 |	So last week on the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:24,800	| IOT210 |	Hotline
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:26,336	| IOT210 |	A question about
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:27,104	| IOT210 |	How
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:29,408	| IOT210 |	You can use Madam a
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:32,480	| IOT210 |	To control automated blinds
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,528	| IOT210 |	Because there isn't currently like
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,808	| IOT210 |	I really awesome blind function
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:38,112	| IOT210 |	This person was using the wink
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:39,904	| IOT210 |	Separate
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,184	| IOT210 |	Heaven and I
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:48,608	| IOT210 |	We have an answer but it really wasn't a full answer and you guys were like you guys didn't tell them there are options
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:51,168	| IOT210 |	Farthest was cuz I wanted to test it out at home
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:53,472	| IOT210 |	I wasn't sure what I could do from here
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:54,240	| IOT210 |	But
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,264	| IOT210 |	Everyone pointed out that
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:57,568	| IOT210 |	They can do this with if
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,616	| IOT210 |	And with stringify
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:02,432	| IOT210 |	Stringify as a company that, cast by
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:04,480	| IOT210 |	And you can still download it it's free
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:05,760	| IOT210 |	Very complex
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,088	| IOT210 |	But
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:11,904	| IOT210 |	Several people gave us the instructions so we're going to share those
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:15,232	| IOT210 |	But before I do that
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:20,352	| IOT210 |	Have to tell you that the Internet of Things podcast outline is sponsored by a pharaoh

EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,544	| IOT210 |	And the board basically
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:04,128	| IOT210 |	You plug it into your existing wired alarm system and then
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:05,664	| IOT210 |	You can control it through the SmartThings Hub
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:08,480	| IOT210 |	So this is kind of a limited use case but

EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:48,160	| IOT210 |	We should announce
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:49,184	| IOT210 |	March is winter
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:50,976	| IOT210 |	Who doesn't
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,000	| IOT210 |	Have a name
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:58,400	| IOT210 |	So he does he just didn't provide it but that's okay because we can text him and
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,424	| IOT210 |	Cadiz information
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:03,264	| IOT210 |	So we did choose a winner you'll be
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,544	| IOT210 |	Schlage connect
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:05,312	| IOT210 |	Lock
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:06,848	| IOT210 |	And no name
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:09,664	| IOT210 |	Thanks for listening thanks for leaving a message and
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:10,176	| IOT210 |	You'll be hearing
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:11,712	| IOT210 |	Okay
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:13,760	| IOT210 |	So let's get back to
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:14,272	| IOT210 |	How this thing
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:19,136	| IOT210 |	The original question was about a Z-Wave motor
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:19,648	| IOT210 |	Engraver
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:21,952	| IOT210 |	And that was the two
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:23,232	| IOT210 |	Raise and lower smart blinds
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,512	| IOT210 |	And wink
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,536	| IOT210 |	Can do that
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:26,816	| IOT210 |	However
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,608	| IOT210 |	Madame a cannot
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:31,680	| IOT210 |	Understand what do that for you through wink
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:32,704	| IOT210 |	However
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:35,008	| IOT210 |	If you create a shortcut in Wink 2
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:37,824	| IOT210 |	Raise or lower your blinds Jose to shortcuts
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,616	| IOT210 |	You can then connect
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:42,432	| IOT210 |	Madame a with wings through EFT
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:47,808	| IOT210 |	Create a recipe that says hey when I say this to Madame a run this wink shortcut
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:50,880	| IOT210 |	So that's the way to link those because you can't do it natively
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:52,928	| IOT210 |	And
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:55,232	| IOT210 |	On the stringify side and this is going to be much
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:56,512	| IOT210 |	Much more.
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:59,584	| IOT210 |	So first off stringify needs to see the blood
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,632	| IOT210 |	Then you create
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:02,144	| IOT210 |	A flow
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:04,448	| IOT210 |	So once you got stringify
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:07,520	| IOT210 |	Able to see the blinds usually you could do that and wink or smart
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:08,544	| IOT210 |	So however
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:11,616	| IOT210 |	Then you basically create a stringify flow
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,920	| IOT210 |	And you included as a c
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:14,432	| IOT210 |	Courtesy
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:16,224	| IOT210 |	Can you have that flow tied to
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,504	| IOT210 |	Madame makeup
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:19,552	| IOT210 |	Also actually use it for a
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:20,064	| IOT210 |	Vim commands
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:22,368	| IOT210 |	And then you can
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:23,136	| IOT210 |	Through the scene
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:25,440	| IOT210 |	Do you say Madam a
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:25,952	| IOT210 |	Start
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:26,976	| IOT210 |	Blah blah blah
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:32,096	| IOT210 |	You may have to say a stringify to start but I think I say a stringify to run
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:32,608	| IOT210 |	Blah blah blah
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:34,656	| IOT210 |	And then it will do so
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,936	| IOT210 |	So that is how you would do that on
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:39,008	| IOT210 |	And remember both shift and string
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:46,432	| IOT210 |	And just to be clear this is Wink specific because the caller had wink and the Graber smart blind motor
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:49,760	| IOT210 |	For smart thing you can actually do this natively with
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:52,064	| IOT210 |	There's a device Handler
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:53,600	| IOT210 |	Where you can change your
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:57,440	| IOT210 |	Blinds and stringify to beat act like a dimmer switch
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:58,464	| IOT210 |	Yes
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:03,072	| IOT210 |	Lots of options for our color last
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:04,864	| IOT210 |	We are sorry that we
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:05,376	| IOT210 |	Progestin
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:11,264	| IOT210 |	And propstore listeners are we got several emails and voicemails on
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:13,056	| IOT210 |	Exactly what we just explained with
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:14,336	| IOT210 |	EFT and stringify
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:19,200	| IOT210 |	So we didn't give a complete answer because of Stacy said she really want to test it before we actually
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:20,480	| IOT210 |	Could say yeah this will work
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:22,016	| IOT210 |	But I haven't been home in 2 weeks
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:23,552	| IOT210 |	So exactly very difficult
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:29,696	| IOT210 |	It's just me. I would know that if you shared your location with me
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:33,792	| IOT210 |	So that concludes the new portion of this week's podcast
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:36,096	| IOT210 |	And stay tuned for a
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:36,864	| IOT210 |	Conversation

EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:41,984	| IOT210 |	His company is building a
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:43,264	| IOT210 |	Device to help
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:45,568	| IOT210 |	Visually impaired people Wayside using haptic
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:47,360	| IOT210 |	Can we talk about
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,384	| IOT210 |	That particular product
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,432	| IOT210 |	We also talked about
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:56,832	| IOT210 |	How we should be using haptics and tips for designers on building haptic feedback into their devices
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:58,368	| IOT210 |	Json products you're going to like it
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:01,440	| IOT210 |	A message from

EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:04,000	| IOT210 |	This would sponsor is software
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:05,536	| IOT210 |	AG
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:11,936	| IOT210 |	Hey everyone we're taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is soft
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:16,288	| IOT210 |	Software Ag and I have Bruce Cain was part of the software AG iot
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:19,104	| IOT210 |	Supers let's kick it off with telling people
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:21,152	| IOT210 |	What is software AG doing with the
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:22,176	| IOT210 |	Internet of Things
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:24,992	| IOT210 |	Capri Jesus 50 year old soccer
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:26,528	| IOT210 |	Company
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:28,832	| IOT210 |	Bread-and-butter is with integration
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:29,600	| IOT210 |	Software
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:30,624	| IOT210 |	So we allowed
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:31,904	| IOT210 |	Companies to talk
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:35,488	| IOT210 |	To each other in the internet of things we have
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:37,280	| IOT210 |	Cumulocity iot plan
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:39,840	| IOT210 |	Ashley platform
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:43,936	| IOT210 |	Is a full iot platform that can be run at the edge
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:49,056	| IOT210 |	As well as in the cloud and that's very important because now we can do a lot more work at the edge
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:50,592	| IOT210 |	Then just up in the club
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:53,920	| IOT210 |	Excellent in Edge Computing is all the rage these days
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:57,248	| IOT210 |	And I understand that you have a great story involving robot
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:59,296	| IOT210 |	They can really underscore the importance of edge
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:01,600	| IOT210 |	Can you share absolute
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:04,160	| IOT210 |	Are cars painted when you buy a new
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:05,696	| IOT210 |	New car is a robot
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:07,232	| IOT210 |	Comes in and does all the paint
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,000	| IOT210 |	No more human
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:12,352	| IOT210 |	Great thing about this is that the robots can analyze
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,120	| IOT210 |	Howard's
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:16,448	| IOT210 |	Painting how fast the arm is moving so you get a perfect
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:16,960	| IOT210 |	Paint job
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:21,312	| IOT210 |	Downside though is that takes a lot of data
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:22,336	| IOT210 |	Can make that happen
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:29,248	| IOT210 |	The other side is we as consumers are a lot more particular than we used to be and we look for every
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:34,368	| IOT210 |	Little defect if there's one tiny blemish in my paint I don't want that car I want another one
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:37,440	| IOT210 |	So because of that the paint jobs have to be part
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:39,488	| IOT210 |	There's a lot that goes into a perk
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:40,000	| IOT210 |	Paint job
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:43,584	| IOT210 |	That's not just a paint in the air mixture but also the
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:45,632	| IOT210 |	Humidity in surroundings
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,656	| IOT210 |	Temperature
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:47,936	| IOT210 |	There's an awful lot
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:52,032	| IOT210 |	Of data that needs to be consumed by these robots in order for them to
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:54,592	| IOT210 |	In the past
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:57,408	| IOT210 |	They would send that data up to the cloud
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:35:03,040	| IOT210 |	The cloud would do the analytics and decide G it's getting a little more humid so let's put a little more
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:06,368	| IOT210 |	Paint to air mixture and would do those adjustments
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:08,928	| IOT210 |	Then the command down the adjustment would be made in Italy
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:09,696	| IOT210 |	Continue to paint
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:12,000	| IOT210 |	Problem is you'd be on the 3rd
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:14,304	| IOT210 |	Ask before you got that information
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:16,096	| IOT210 |	So that robot needed
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:18,144	| IOT210 |	That data at the edge
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:23,008	| IOT210 |	Quinoa ciot being installed at the edge running all this
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:25,824	| IOT210 |	Analytics at the edge remove that late
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:32,224	| IOT210 |	See time from sending that date up to the cloud they're able to do much better paint jobs less blemishes
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:35,040	| IOT210 |	Which means less reduce or less
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:36,576	| IOT210 |	Cost to the manufacturer
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:41,696	| IOT210 |	Excellent so if I wanted to experiment with software AG Eskimi lacity platform
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:42,976	| IOT210 |	Where can I go to find out more
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:49,888	| IOT210 |	Yes you can download a trial at sacree jd.com iot now and I really
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:52,448	| IOT210 |	Encourage you to do so because you can connect a device
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:53,984	| IOT210 |	Less than 2 minutes
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:57,568	| IOT210 |	Create some analytics in less than a minute and a half
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:58,592	| IOT210 |	Create dashboards
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:01,920	| IOT210 |	So in less than 5 minutes
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:02,688	| IOT210 |	You can beat
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:07,808	| IOT210 |	Behrman thing with your devices connected to an iot platform
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:19,328	| IOT210 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:20,096	| IOT210 |	Is Keith
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:20,864	| IOT210 |	Kirkland's
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,400	| IOT210 |	Annie's Biko founder
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:24,192	| IOT210 |	Where were
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:26,496	| IOT210 |	And we are going to be talking today about haptic
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,288	| IOT210 |	Hi Keith how are you today
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:30,592	| IOT210 |	And on fantastic how are you
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:32,384	| IOT210 |	Man I am super excited
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:33,408	| IOT210 |	I love happy
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:35,456	| IOT210 |	Dixon for everybody who's like
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:38,784	| IOT210 |	It's basically using vibration to like indicate to you
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,832	| IOT210 |	Touch it's basically touch
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,112	| IOT210 |	To indicate something
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:46,976	| IOT210 |	I really wanted to tell me my right for my left because I'm not very good at that
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:49,024	| IOT210 |	But we're going to explore all the ways
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:50,560	| IOT210 |	So
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:51,328	| IOT210 |	First off
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:52,608	| IOT210 |	Keep let's talk about
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:53,632	| IOT210 |	Whatwears works
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:57,728	| IOT210 |	We design products and experiences that communicate information through touch
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:02,080	| IOT210 |	Parkway band is a wearable haptic navigation bicycle
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:07,968	| IOT210 |	Basically we forgot it would have got people to what in a destination using vibrating shoes
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:09,504	| IOT210 |	Without the need for any
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:10,272	| IOT210 |	Visual audio
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,064	| IOT210 |	And
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:18,464	| IOT210 |	Back in 2017 we use that technology to help us Blind Side
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:20,768	| IOT210 |	New York City marathon
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:23,072	| IOT210 |	Which is awesome and you
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:24,096	| IOT210 |	You kind of have to tell us
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:26,400	| IOT210 |	Why only the first 15 miles
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:27,168	| IOT210 |	Did he get tired
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:28,448	| IOT210 |	Oh yes
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:30,752	| IOT210 |	So basically you know
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:31,776	| IOT210 |	The Merritt Island
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:33,056	| IOT210 |	It was Marathon day and
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:34,336	| IOT210 |	We were getting everything
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:37,920	| IOT210 |	Kevin my co-founder also ran the race with Simon
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:40,736	| IOT210 |	And we put all the devices that everything
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:42,784	| IOT210 |	And it turned out that the weather
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:44,320	| IOT210 |	Was really really bad
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:45,856	| IOT210 |	And so it ended up
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:48,672	| IOT210 |	Raining for most of the marathon
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:50,208	| IOT210 |	And about 15 miles then
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:51,488	| IOT210 |	We basically ate you know
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:57,632	| IOT210 |	Put together the night before and didn't think about what I said was thinking about trying to get him through this race
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:00,704	| IOT210 |	That was a sound like a surprise ride
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:01,728	| IOT210 |	At some point
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:03,776	| IOT210 |	Midwifery that divides Gatos
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:05,056	| IOT210 |	Stop working because of the rain
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:08,384	| IOT210 |	That is such a bummer but it's also like
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:11,200	| IOT210 |	Valuable life lessons
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:13,504	| IOT210 |	What is provocative
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:16,320	| IOT210 |	All right
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:19,648	| IOT210 |	So I have been excited by haptics
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:22,976	| IOT210 |	For really long time like I said I have a terrible sense of direction
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:24,256	| IOT210 |	I've always wanted my phone.
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:27,584	| IOT210 |	Book that is right no not that way
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:28,096	| IOT210 |	Go the other way
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,120	| IOT210 |	That's my settle
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:32,704	| IOT210 |	And we've had it in
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:35,008	| IOT210 |	Actually phones for a while in terms of like
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:38,336	| IOT210 |	That little vibration that you get when you touch your phone screen
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:39,360	| IOT210 |	That is haptic feedback
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:40,896	| IOT210 |	But you actually got started
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:46,528	| IOT210 |	In a way that I think is super cool for iot and wearables Market which was trying to build
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:49,088	| IOT210 |	A suit to teach you Kung Fu can you tell me about
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:52,160	| IOT210 |	I had always been a
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:54,208	| IOT210 |	Big movement Lerner and
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:55,744	| IOT210 |	I always ended up with you
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:39:00,352	| IOT210 |	Weird injuries ww3 stop me from doing that movement that I started to love
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:00,864	| IOT210 |	Learning how to do
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:02,912	| IOT210 |	And so
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:04,192	| IOT210 |	Program at Pride
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:07,776	| IOT210 |	Add a previous background mechanical engineering and then
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:10,336	| IOT210 |	Did that for that and then I decided to
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:13,664	| IOT210 |	Come back and see if she make her and sad and so I knew that.
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:15,968	| IOT210 |	And I can see the sign that if I see
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:18,784	| IOT210 |	I was going to Industry for a while mainly going handbag stuff
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:22,112	| IOT210 |	A better time at lesportsac and Calvin Klein and coach
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:24,928	| IOT210 |	Anytime came out lyrics Dance With My Father
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:26,208	| IOT210 |	Amazon handbags
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:26,976	| IOT210 |	Bios
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:31,328	| IOT210 |	Is a great way to use designer for Humanity and someone back to school
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:35,680	| IOT210 |	The Grand Design to figure out what that might be and along the way I ended up being study
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,472	| IOT210 |	Brooklyn
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:39,776	| IOT210 |	Renovation design program which
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:41,824	| IOT210 |	That allowed me to go to town what's that mean
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:42,592	| IOT210 |	Technology
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:48,224	| IOT210 |	How do I integrate
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:49,248	| IOT210 |	Technology and Society
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:54,368	| IOT210 |	So much, until I do something that
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:57,952	| IOT210 |	Is really really great and so at the time
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:58,464	| IOT210 |	Still kind of
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:04,608	| IOT210 |	End it movement challenges that I was having I kind of put together the pieces that was like okay I think
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:07,424	| IOT210 |	It's possible for you to make a suit that can help you to
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:08,960	| IOT210 |	Learn kung fu
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:09,984	| IOT210 |	And I got that
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:15,360	| IOT210 |	See something inside that I had and I thought I was totally super duper original I was like wow
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:16,640	| IOT210 |	Like the Matrix is now
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:17,664	| IOT210 |	And then now all of
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:18,432	| IOT210 |	All the sudden
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:24,832	| IOT210 |	I go and I do a go to research since when I realized that you have been built at MIT card to check goes to
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:27,392	| IOT210 |	And basically they kind of validated all this
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:28,416	| IOT210 |	That I had when I was
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:28,928	| IOT210 |	Thinking of
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:33,792	| IOT210 |	And that was basically like how do you use hotfix to come correct from
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:35,328	| IOT210 |	Posture
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:38,144	| IOT210 |	And so that was kind of the permits and the idea but
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:40,960	| IOT210 |	Challenging that suit with a
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:42,240	| IOT210 |	What was kind of really started
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:45,056	| IOT210 |	Groovy Cambodia parent is that
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:47,616	| IOT210 |	But I want you to raise your breasts 2 inches off of your lap
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:49,920	| IOT210 |	Using vibration how do I tell you to do that
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:51,968	| IOT210 |	How do you tell me to do that
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:54,016	| IOT210 |	That was my next question for you
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:56,320	| IOT210 |	So I can put a motor to top of your
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:57,088	| IOT210 |	Dress right
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:59,136	| IOT210 |	And maybe it will feel like you should be pulled up
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:01,440	| IOT210 |	Apple at the bottom of your results
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:04,000	| IOT210 |	Krista at work kind of
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:07,328	| IOT210 |	Hadn't really been done yet and there was no
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:11,424	| IOT210 |	Things are kind of based off of like what we start to call a haptic language away of
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:16,032	| IOT210 |	How can I signal to you to do information without having to tell you what to do
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:17,312	| IOT210 |	Without having to explain it
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:19,360	| IOT210 |	How can I be so intuitive
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:21,152	| IOT210 |	That you can just understand that this is
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:24,992	| IOT210 |	And that's kind of what we talked about haptic design
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:27,040	| IOT210 |	We're like we're using tots
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:30,112	| IOT210 |	And the same way that a graphical designer uses
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:30,880	| IOT210 |	Schedule
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:32,928	| IOT210 |	2 light design experience
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:34,208	| IOT210 |	For our users
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:35,744	| IOT210 |	And where
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:38,048	| IOT210 |	Just kind of talking into a different sense
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:39,072	| IOT210 |	You know why not
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:42,144	| IOT210 |	Is kind of often overlooked in the in the design space
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:45,472	| IOT210 |	I like it this is actually something that I
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:48,800	| IOT210 |	Read about and I've actually wanted for a while so not kung fu
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:50,080	| IOT210 |	Stupid I do a lot of Pilates
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:51,872	| IOT210 |	As part of that
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:53,407	| IOT210 |	I sit there and
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:56,479	| IOT210 |	Like I do if I just had a little vibration here that was like
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:41:57,759	| IOT210 |	Activate this muscle
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:41:58,271	| IOT210 |	Right here
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:41:59,807	| IOT210 |	Or
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:02,111	| IOT210 |	You're doing it wrong but then I did quickly realize that
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:03,903	| IOT210 |	What you're talkin about this language
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,671	| IOT210 |	Haptics
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:05,951	| IOT210 |	What apps come into play like
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:06,463	| IOT210 |	What is like
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:08,767	| IOT210 |	Activate that muscle versus
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:12,607	| IOT210 |	Stay put but
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:13,375	| IOT210 |	You guys
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:15,423	| IOT210 |	Kind of figured it out on the way finder
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:16,703	| IOT210 |	Makes sense so talk to me about
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:18,239	| IOT210 |	Your haptic portal
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:22,591	| IOT210 |	Yes I have two quarter is this idea
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:24,639	| IOT210 |	I kind of got coin through kind of
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:25,919	| IOT210 |	Are using
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:27,967	| IOT210 |	The device and having the experience and
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:29,759	| IOT210 |	Basically what it is
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:31,039	| IOT210 |	You can imagine
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:32,063	| IOT210 |	You're looking forward
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:36,671	| IOT210 |	That you know I'm not sure you know I feel like most people play Pac-Man
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:38,463	| IOT210 |	Or have cut out a large enough lights
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:40,511	| IOT210 |	Pie crust baked pie
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:42,303	| IOT210 |	Either way you look at it at your face
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:43,839	| IOT210 |	Infobear you're kind of like BMP
EDL	00:42:43,839	00:42:44,607	| IOT210 |	Pac-Man
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:48,959	| IOT210 |	That's the correct
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:49,727	| IOT210 |	Lego basic
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:52,031	| IOT210 |	Everything else is some basic Lisa
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:54,591	| IOT210 |	Some varying degree of wrong from that and so will be
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:59,711	| IOT210 |	We did it we decided 360 have to experience it as you change orientation
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:02,271	| IOT210 |	Is it bad to give you constant feedback to let you know
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:06,623	| IOT210 |	Exactly how wrong you are and whether you're getting stronger or whether you're turning more into
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:08,415	| IOT210 |	What we consider the correct direction
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:09,951	| IOT210 |	Which is why the device happens
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:13,535	| IOT210 |	Got it why choose to do it that way
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:16,863	| IOT210 |	I mean my gut when thinking about communication right
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:17,631	| IOT210 |	And communication
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:18,399	| IOT210 |	Your touch is like
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:24,287	| IOT210 |	Like we have to figure out this like intuitive language for haptic feedback just like we did for like
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:29,663	| IOT210 |	Touch-sensitive screens on devices were all in a Lego pinch-to-zoom and swiping so
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:32,735	| IOT210 |	Why go with something that's a little bit more
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:34,271	| IOT210 |	I want to say generic maybe more basic
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:36,575	| IOT210 |	One of the things is that
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:38,111	| IOT210 |	Language acquisition is
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:39,391	| IOT210 |	Really challenging
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:41,439	| IOT210 |	You know like
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:43,743	| IOT210 |	Currently learning Swedish outside learning Japanese
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:44,511	| IOT210 |	German
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:48,863	| IOT210 |	Spanish is probably my best bet so far and you know it just takes a lot of time
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:49,631	| IOT210 |	How to learn a language
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:51,167	| IOT210 |	It's the one of the things that we're both
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:54,239	| IOT210 |	Be careful about while we're going to tap that language is
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:44:00,639	| IOT210 |	That we need to make sure that the language acquisition time that the time that it takes for you to understand.
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:02,431	| IOT210 |	Experience is a short at Papa
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:04,735	| IOT210 |	And now so the way we've done that
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:08,831	| IOT210 |	The language creation and the two major components
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:11,135	| IOT210 |	Suppression of your haptic experiences
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:13,951	| IOT210 |	And how experiences are
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:14,975	| IOT210 |	Wheatley design
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:15,999	| IOT210 |	Haptic
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:17,535	| IOT210 |	Experiences
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,815	| IOT210 |	That deliver
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:20,095	| IOT210 |	1
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:23,423	| IOT210 |	Piece of information is critical to the function of the device
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:27,263	| IOT210 |	Extremely effectively and very intuitive William very quickly
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:28,799	| IOT210 |	Anastasis I have to corridor
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:31,103	| IOT210 |	That would have the court order
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:32,127	| IOT210 |	We get people in the life
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:33,407	| IOT210 |	We say
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:34,431	| IOT210 |	Do a 360 spin
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:38,527	| IOT210 |	And we tell them to spin again at the stop in the direction that they think
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:39,551	| IOT210 |	Is the right way to go
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:41,087	| IOT210 |	And most people can figure out
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:43,391	| IOT210 |	Within about 15 seconds
EDL	00:44:43,391	00:44:45,695	| IOT210 |	And those are the only instructions that they have
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:47,487	| IOT210 |	And so we had to make sure that
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:51,583	| IOT210 |	The main function of the device could be Mastered by any person that picked up a spice
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:52,863	| IOT210 |	Straight Out of the Box
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:53,631	| IOT210 |	And then
EDL	00:44:53,631	00:44:55,423	| IOT210 |	The second part of that is
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:56,447	| IOT210 |	Optic
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:58,495	| IOT210 |	Russians have expressions and more like worth
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:01,823	| IOT210 |	Experiences have like a chips right you know that.
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:05,151	| IOT210 |	Immediate thing there's an immediate reaction is very intuitive
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:08,223	| IOT210 |	You know whether you like it or not this one thing but you know like
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:11,295	| IOT210 |	The experience and understanding that something just occurred of instantaneous
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:12,575	| IOT210 |	Bright
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:14,623	| IOT210 |	And then we have to have to get special
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:15,391	| IOT210 |	Kids like us
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:19,487	| IOT210 |	Because you got an A on your paper today so I'm whatever right
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:20,511	| IOT210 |	Self-expression
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:23,583	| IOT210 |	Communicate some discrete piece of information that is important
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:25,631	| IOT210 |	A left turn is coming up in 30 ft
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:32,287	| IOT210 |	Please take a little bit more time to learn and I'm still trying to simplify these as well to make them really distinctive that
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:33,823	| IOT210 |	Experiences
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:35,103	| IOT210 |	The more advanced features
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:38,687	| IOT210 |	They give you more advanced and you want some information enter the experience
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:42,015	| IOT210 |	I wanted you to understand the initial experience
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:43,295	| IOT210 |	The haptic experience
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:46,111	| IOT210 |	They can go into the expressions and get more
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:49,439	| IOT210 |	Kind of like important and significant information for their travels
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:52,255	| IOT210 |	But we had to design something that worked out of the box.
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:55,327	| IOT210 |	BG's instantaneously it was it was super important
EDL	00:45:56,863	00:46:01,983	| IOT210 |	So you guys are designing this for people who are blind or visually impaired but
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:03,519	| IOT210 |	I kind of look at this and I'm like
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:05,311	| IOT210 |	I wouldn't mind having the sort of
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:09,151	| IOT210 |	Feedback in my day-to-day life especially for things like Anna wayfinding and different
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:10,175	| IOT210 |	Office Buildings or
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:13,759	| IOT210 |	Hiking trails trying to find the actual Trail is supposed to like
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:17,087	| IOT210 |	Now I'm suddenly stuck in a Ravine and I don't know how I'm getting there
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:18,879	| IOT210 |	So I'm curious Lake
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:21,951	| IOT210 |	What do you need to make this happen and then
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:24,511	| IOT210 |	Could it go beyond just the visually impaired
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:26,815	| IOT210 |	Initially when we started
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:29,887	| IOT210 |	We were just trying to get people out of their phones and back into the real world
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:33,983	| IOT210 |	And so we saw all these opportunities where
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:37,055	| IOT210 |	The screen based devices that we were using
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:40,383	| IOT210 |	We're requiring a huge amount of our visual attention
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:41,663	| IOT210 |	We thought that
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:42,943	| IOT210 |	You know navigation
EDL	00:46:43,455	00:46:44,479	| IOT210 |	Inherently visual
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:45,759	| IOT210 |	And so
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:48,319	| IOT210 |	To be able to navigate and use your vision
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:50,623	| IOT210 |	Functionally while navigating a getting there
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:53,183	| IOT210 |	Information system other senses
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:55,487	| IOT210 |	And so we see kind of have to
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:59,327	| IOT210 |	The next Frontier you look at every other sense
EDL	00:46:59,327	00:47:00,095	| IOT210 |	There is
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:02,399	| IOT210 |	A hundred billion dollar Industries built around them
EDL	00:47:03,167	00:47:04,703	| IOT210 |	You know like I'm with the
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:06,495	| IOT210 |	The immersion of arbr
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:07,775	| IOT210 |	You know have
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:10,591	| IOT210 |	Full 360 4K
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:12,895	| IOT210 |	You know high-definition video you have
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:18,783	| IOT210 |	3D Audios in the box drop 20 feet behind you over your left shoulder but then when you go to pick up that box
EDL	00:47:19,295	00:47:21,087	| IOT210 |	You still have the experience of
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:24,927	| IOT210 |	Having to pretend that there's something your hands when there is that so
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:25,951	| IOT210 |	We seek on Apopka
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:26,463	| IOT210 |	Texas kind of life
EDL	00:47:27,231	00:47:28,511	| IOT210 |	Kunming industry
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:30,047	| IOT210 |	That's going to start
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:31,583	| IOT210 |	Create an impact in
EDL	00:47:32,095	00:47:33,887	| IOT210 |	Media and designers and
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:35,935	| IOT210 |	And it's on right and right now
EDL	00:47:35,935	00:47:37,215	| IOT210 |	We kind of see that
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:39,263	| IOT210 |	Working with the Blind and Visually Impaired
EDL	00:47:39,775	00:47:41,567	| IOT210 |	For the first part of the experience
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:43,103	| IOT210 |	Want it really
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:44,895	| IOT210 |	WorkSource Prince because
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:46,431	| IOT210 |	Tabata visually impaired
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:47,711	| IOT210 |	Population
EDL	00:47:47,711	00:47:49,503	| IOT210 |	They actually have the greatest
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:51,039	| IOT210 |	Understanding of tactile acuity
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:52,063	| IOT210 |	The best possible
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:53,855	| IOT210 |	Designing for
EDL	00:47:54,367	00:47:58,719	| IOT210 |	And so we understand that like and we can really nail. You safe than every other use
EDL	00:47:58,719	00:48:01,023	| IOT210 |	Case of follow suit binder
EDL	00:48:01,023	00:48:02,303	| IOT210 |	And so, that's our plan right now
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:04,863	| IOT210 |	You guys have been doing this for a while
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:06,143	| IOT210 |	And
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:07,423	| IOT210 |	You've learned valuable things about water
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:10,239	| IOT210 |	But
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:14,591	| IOT210 |	When you mentioned like in gaming and picking up a box and that's where thing I'm like oh
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:15,615	| IOT210 |	Yes please
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:21,247	| IOT210 |	So what are some of the things you've learned in playing with haptics as much as you guys have
EDL	00:48:21,247	00:48:23,039	| IOT210 |	I know you felt away ban but
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:24,575	| IOT210 |	You guys have also built
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:27,647	| IOT210 |	You thought your kung fu suit or tried to fill part of that
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:32,511	| IOT210 |	Text me about the things you've learned that you could pass along to other designers who are like
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:34,303	| IOT210 |	I'd love to get involved in that
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:35,583	| IOT210 |	What do I need to know
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:38,911	| IOT210 |	So I think the first thing is is bad
EDL	00:48:38,911	00:48:41,471	| IOT210 |	You got to have a bit of understanding and physiology
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:44,287	| IOT210 |	Different parts of the body have different resume
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:45,311	| IOT210 |	Wish instead
EDL	00:48:45,823	00:48:47,615	| IOT210 |	You know that your hands your lips
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:49,663	| IOT210 |	Your time. Pretty amazing
EDL	00:48:49,663	00:48:51,455	| IOT210 |	You know your back is pretty bad
EDL	00:48:51,967	00:48:54,527	| IOT210 |	And so when you're designing you have to experience
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:49:00,159	| IOT210 |	Usually has to be pressing against some forcing of the skin to be effective and it depending on what part of the body that you're
EDL	00:49:00,159	00:49:01,183	| IOT210 |	Designing for
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:04,255	| IOT210 |	It really changes kind of like this
EDL	00:49:04,255	00:49:05,791	| IOT210 |	Applications of the thing that you're building
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:08,607	| IOT210 |	The underside of the wrist for example
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:09,631	| IOT210 |	You know it is
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:12,191	| IOT210 |	Super Suds vibration activation
EDL	00:49:12,191	00:49:14,495	| IOT210 |	Even though the resolution is below a light
EDL	00:49:15,007	00:49:15,775	| IOT210 |	Cotswolds
EDL	00:49:16,287	00:49:17,055	| IOT210 |	Send the signal
EDL	00:49:17,567	00:49:18,591	| IOT210 |	Butt on your back
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:19,871	| IOT210 |	Act like that sensitivity is it
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:21,151	| IOT210 |	There's a lot that's so
EDL	00:49:21,663	00:49:28,063	| IOT210 |	Pay attention to what part of the body you're working with and understand the physiology kind of like of that body part that you're working with
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:29,087	| IOT210 |	How it responds to touch
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:31,135	| IOT210 |	It's kind of like a good first step
EDL	00:49:31,135	00:49:32,415	| IOT210 |	Additionally
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:34,463	| IOT210 |	I think the biggest thing is just to kind of go in
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:36,511	| IOT210 |	I really have fun with it
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:38,303	| IOT210 |	You know like that so much inspiration
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:39,839	| IOT210 |	And
EDL	00:49:39,839	00:49:41,631	| IOT210 |	You know this world of
EDL	00:49:41,631	00:49:42,399	| IOT210 |	Using
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:44,191	| IOT210 |	A different sense
EDL	00:49:44,191	00:49:48,031	| IOT210 |	It's the kind of as a foundation for the work that you want to do any work that you want to explore
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:49,567	| IOT210 |	Verity
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:50,847	| IOT210 |	Inspiration is that you
EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:52,127	| IOT210 |	Kind of full from
EDL	00:49:52,127	00:49:52,895	| IOT210 |	You know like
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:54,175	| IOT210 |	Awesome fiction but
EDL	00:49:54,687	00:49:58,271	| IOT210 |	And I really kind of like pop culture or just anywhere
EDL	00:49:58,271	00:49:59,551	| IOT210 |	Tennessee
EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:01,855	| IOT210 |	What types of things
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:02,879	| IOT210 |	You really could
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:04,159	| IOT210 |	Be doing
EDL	00:50:04,159	00:50:05,439	| IOT210 |	If you didn't have to
EDL	00:50:05,951	00:50:06,975	| IOT210 |	Look at it or
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:07,743	| IOT210 |	Hear it
EDL	00:50:07,743	00:50:08,255	| IOT210 |	Understand
EDL	00:50:08,767	00:50:10,047	| IOT210 |	And I think God
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:12,351	| IOT210 |	Just kind of being in that space playing in that space
EDL	00:50:12,351	00:50:15,167	| IOT210 |	Kind of like documenting kind of what your understanding is
EDL	00:50:15,679	00:50:16,703	| IOT210 |	Because right now I think
EDL	00:50:17,215	00:50:17,983	| IOT210 |	The other Opera
EDL	00:50:18,495	00:50:20,287	| IOT210 |	90s R&B in the state says that
EDL	00:50:20,799	00:50:23,871	| IOT210 |	We're all trying to figure out how to make us stuff and documents
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:24,639	| IOT210 |	Stop
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:27,967	| IOT210 |	Write this stuff that we recall haptics with that we're still figuring out
EDL	00:50:28,479	00:50:30,271	| IOT210 |	Right now there aren't really any
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:31,807	| IOT210 |	Three platforms that make it simple
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:32,575	| IOT210 |	Or
EDL	00:50:32,575	00:50:33,855	| IOT210 |	These types of possibility
EDL	00:50:34,367	00:50:35,135	| IOT210 |	Be created
EDL	00:50:35,135	00:50:35,647	| IOT210 |	Bye
EDL	00:50:36,671	00:50:37,439	| IOT210 |	Doctor Who
EDL	00:50:37,439	00:50:39,999	| IOT210 |	Pick it up in the same way you have as Photoshop or illustrator
EDL	00:50:40,767	00:50:43,327	| IOT210 |	And that was like I think there's a huge opportunity
EDL	00:50:43,327	00:50:44,351	| IOT210 |	Anastasis
EDL	00:50:44,351	00:50:45,375	| IOT210 |	Really
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:47,423	| IOT210 |	Explore different ways of
EDL	00:50:47,423	00:50:47,935	| IOT210 |	Howard Dr
EDL	00:50:48,703	00:50:49,471	| IOT210 |	Work
EDL	00:50:49,471	00:50:50,751	| IOT210 |	Answer
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:54,591	| IOT210 |	Share that work on Sunday with one another so that we can all move that District forward like together
EDL	00:50:55,103	00:50:55,871	| IOT210 |	I like it
EDL	00:50:55,871	00:50:58,943	| IOT210 |	Quick question for you this is a very practical question but
EDL	00:50:59,455	00:51:00,991	| IOT210 |	You know I'm a very practical person
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:06,367	| IOT210 |	So there's the way band idea and I think looking at the spec sheet that is probably way out of date
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:07,647	| IOT210 |	It was like 3 hour battery
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:11,231	| IOT210 |	When I'm thinking about haptics what is that do for battery life
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:17,631	| IOT210 |	What is that implementation really look like if I'm going to have a phone that communicates to a device or device that I'm in a
EDL	00:51:17,631	00:51:18,399	| IOT210 |	We're all day
EDL	00:51:18,399	00:51:19,935	| IOT210 |	Navigation purposes
EDL	00:51:20,703	00:51:26,591	| IOT210 |	It doesn't really horribly affect battery life vibrating Motors definitely have a drain on battery
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:28,383	| IOT210 |	That's pretty clear
EDL	00:51:28,383	00:51:28,895	| IOT210 |	But
EDL	00:51:29,407	00:51:30,431	| IOT210 |	The thing is is that like
EDL	00:51:30,431	00:51:34,527	| IOT210 |	You're not navigating so much of the day and so while you're out use
EDL	00:51:35,039	00:51:35,807	| IOT210 |	Device
EDL	00:51:35,807	00:51:36,575	| IOT210 |	The average
EDL	00:51:37,087	00:51:38,367	| IOT210 |	Walker
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:39,647	| IOT210 |	Thing is probably about like
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:40,159	| IOT210 |	20
EDL	00:51:40,671	00:51:44,255	| IOT210 |	I know usually at that point people using public transportation
EDL	00:51:44,255	00:51:46,815	| IOT210 |	You know like within that kind of a distance
EDL	00:51:46,815	00:51:48,095	| IOT210 |	You're walking like
EDL	00:51:48,607	00:51:51,167	| IOT210 |	Maybe an hour a day maybe two hours a day maximum
EDL	00:51:51,935	00:51:52,703	| IOT210 |	So
EDL	00:51:52,703	00:51:56,031	| IOT210 |	The battery life on the device last for days without being charged
EDL	00:51:56,031	00:51:59,359	| IOT210 |	True that's a good point probably one of those tips that we should really thing
EDL	00:51:59,359	00:52:00,639	| IOT210 |	Think about like when implementing something
EDL	00:52:01,663	00:52:07,295	| IOT210 |	This is really exciting and you guys are going to do a crowdfunding campaign in
EDL	00:52:07,295	00:52:08,831	| IOT210 |	August or September correct
EDL	00:52:09,855	00:52:11,135	| IOT210 |	Yes that's correct
EDL	00:52:11,135	00:52:12,415	| IOT210 |	Tell me more about this campaign
EDL	00:52:13,695	00:52:15,999	| IOT210 |	So in August or September will be watching
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:17,023	| IOT210 |	Kickstarter campaign
EDL	00:52:17,023	00:52:19,839	| IOT210 |	I will be delivering the very first playback devices
EDL	00:52:19,839	00:52:20,607	| IOT210 |	To the public
EDL	00:52:21,119	00:52:22,143	| IOT210 |	And so everyone will have enough
EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:23,679	| IOT210 |	Free water
EDL	00:52:23,679	00:52:25,215	| IOT210 |	I've been based off of those
EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:26,495	| IOT210 |	Well Manufacturing
EDL	00:52:27,007	00:52:28,287	| IOT210 |	The goal is to deliver the product
EDL	00:52:28,799	00:52:31,103	| IOT210 |	By April of 2020
EDL	00:52:31,103	00:52:32,383	| IOT210 |	Super excited
EDL	00:52:32,383	00:52:34,175	| IOT210 |	Getting everything ready and
EDL	00:52:34,687	00:52:37,247	| IOT210 |	It's a big moment for us. It's just been a long time in the making
EDL	00:52:37,759	00:52:38,783	| IOT210 |	It sounds like it okay
EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:42,111	| IOT210 |	Well awesome Wilke thanks for coming on the show this week
EDL	00:52:42,111	00:52:48,511	| IOT210 |	And good luck to you that's it for this week thanks so much for
