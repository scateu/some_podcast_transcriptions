EDL	00:00:55,296	00:00:56,064	| episode2 |	Like
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:57,856	| episode2 |	It was like the segments on a run
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:01:00,672	| episode2 |	And I was like
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:04,000	| episode2 |	You're right there nuclear nonproliferation.
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:06,560	| episode2 |	Stacy Stacy Smart Home
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:07,840	| episode2 |	Awesome
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:10,144	| episode2 |	Prom proposals with afterwards I thought I was going to
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:12,960	| episode2 |	Proxibid
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:15,520	| episode2 |	Yeah I think prom proposals wins that one but
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:19,360	| episode2 |	It was awesome I watched it two times I thought it was great you showed off
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:23,200	| episode2 |	A lot of the gadgets that you have in your house many we talked about on
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:24,992	| episode2 |	Pryor podcast before
EDL	00:01:24,992	00:01:31,392	| episode2 |	There was I know I know Nightline wanted to take an angle of hey how safe and secure is this so they had this this hacker guy is
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:33,440	| episode2 |	Well on the segment was trying to get into your
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:35,232	| episode2 |	Home netwerks who never did which
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:37,280	| episode2 |	Kudos to you for that
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:42,656	| episode2 |	But eventually I think you let him into the network just to do some demonstration things and
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:49,056	| episode2 |	He scared the bejesus out of you turning your blender on right in the middle of you and the in the house talking in Iowa
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:51,104	| episode2 |	Laugh my tail off for that that was hysterical
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:53,664	| episode2 |	The not so funny part was
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:56,736	| episode2 |	When he had access he was able to unlock your one of your doors
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:01,344	| episode2 |	What was kind of underplayed
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:02,112	| episode2 |	In the
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:04,160	| episode2 |	The segment in this was actually I should
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:06,208	| episode2 |	Make it clear this was actually shot back in
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:08,256	| episode2 |	In January so this was shot in January
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:09,024	| episode2 |	May 12th
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:10,816	| episode2 |	So not even a week after I got back
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:12,608	| episode2 |	And
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:15,680	| episode2 |	What happened was Nightline to contact
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:18,496	| episode2 |	And asked me to set everything up on the wink hub
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,800	| episode2 |	Because the wink Hub have a known folder
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:21,568	| episode2 |	Mobility
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:22,592	| episode2 |	That they can take advantage
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,408	| episode2 |	So I actually dismantle
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,688	| episode2 |	My
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,456	| episode2 |	Set up
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:27,968	| episode2 |	And put everything
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:33,344	| episode2 |	And they they specifically wanted
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:34,368	| episode2 |	Get on a version of the Wings
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,416	| episode2 |	Actually hadn't been patched yet
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:39,488	| episode2 |	So folks this is how your TV sausage
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,536	| episode2 |	Scary
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,584	| episode2 |	And they had the hacker come in
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,376	| episode2 |	And he
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,400	| episode2 |	To get into my Wi-Fi
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:48,704	| episode2 |	He drove around
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:49,728	| episode2 |	The handshake
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:52,800	| episode2 |	Show
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:55,104	| episode2 |	In the plan was that they would get the handshake
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,128	| episode2 |	I would run it through
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:57,920	| episode2 |	Get basically
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,456	| episode2 |	Accessed
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:02,784	| episode2 |	My password
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,344	| episode2 |	Code cracking
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,136	| episode2 |	So they've got a Super Cub
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:07,648	| episode2 |	Cheaters attack you
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:08,928	| episode2 |	That they were like
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:11,488	| episode2 |	We're going to try to get
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:16,096	| episode2 |	That's not so stupid after all was it actually had
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,888	| episode2 |	They have legitimate clients that are not
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:21,728	| episode2 |	So those clients also had a job running
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,776	| episode2 |	That took up a lot of data
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:25,824	| episode2 |	So
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:29,152	| episode2 |	My my password my Wi-Fi password is
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:31,968	| episode2 |	Longer than password
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,552	| episode2 |	1 2 3 4
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,832	| episode2 |	It contains you know
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:38,624	| episode2 |	Different
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,648	| episode2 |	Characters letters
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,160	| episode2 |	Isn't that sort of
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:41,952	| episode2 |	Special character
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,256	| episode2 |	Iot podcast with a capital p
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,024	| episode2 |	There you go
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:49,120	| episode2 |	Guess that you cracked my code who needed supercomputing
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,168	| episode2 |	So yeah so
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:51,936	| episode2 |	Basically
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:54,752	| episode2 |	My guess is they didn't have a lot of
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:56,800	| episode2 |	They just have several
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:03:59,872	| episode2 |	Whatever
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:01,152	| episode2 |	Maybe they had the equivalent of 2
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:01,664	| episode2 |	Do Smartphones work
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:03,968	| episode2 |	And I'd given them
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,760	| episode2 |	So I basic
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,528	| episode2 |	Sickly
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,040	| episode2 |	Typed in my
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,624	| episode2 |	But it was still very creepy
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,648	| episode2 |	Sitting there
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,976	| episode2 |	You know looking at his little interface where he was like
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:15,744	| episode2 |	Look
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,280	| episode2 |	And watching things go up and down
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:19,327	| episode2 |	End
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:19,839	| episode2 |	Hello
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,399	| episode2 |	It was very uncomfortable
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:27,519	| episode2 |	In actually until it aired I didn't realize that he never got my
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,079	| episode2 |	And a mirror at the hacker lives in Austin
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:31,871	| episode2 |	So I was like
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:35,711	| episode2 |	2 there's this guy in Austin who may or may not know my password
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,735	| episode2 |	I should probably change that
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:38,783	| episode2 |	And this is the issue
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:41,343	| episode2 |	Because I have so many Wi-Fi
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:42,111	| episode2 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:44,927	| episode2 |	Do I really need to change my password
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:49,279	| episode2 |	Well yeah I mean you think about it
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:52,607	| episode2 |	Not right now maybe in your case yes but for everyone else
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:55,167	| episode2 |	As we adopt a Smart Homes
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:59,775	| episode2 |	And we have all these devices more more devices in the coming years connected to the Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:02,335	| episode2 |	And we change the password that's it that's a hassle
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:04,383	| episode2 |	Yeah the nest
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:10,015	| episode2 |	When you have your Wi-Fi password on an S that is in click wheel is like putting your password in with a rotary phone it's
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:14,111	| episode2 |	Okay so the learning experience
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,623	| episode2 |	From
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,415	| episode2 |	Nightline
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,463	| episode2 |	Other than TV shows are not exact
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,511	| episode2 |	As they appear
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,023	| episode2 |	On TV
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,559	| episode2 |	We already knew
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,095	| episode2 |	Was that
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,631	| episode2 |	You know your house
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:28,191	| episode2 |	Is vulnerable and
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:31,007	| episode2 |	I actually have as my guests on this way
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:31,775	| episode2 |	Sweet show
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:34,079	| episode2 |	Josh Korman who is from I am the cowboy
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,383	| episode2 |	Cavalry
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,151	| episode2 |	Which is a
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:39,711	| episode2 |	Security organization working to talk in more depth about that
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,479	| episode2 |	Soon but
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:41,759	| episode2 |	You know I just
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,831	| episode2 |	As we're putting these things in guys
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:46,879	| episode2 |	It is really important to think about
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,671	| episode2 |	Setting a password
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,975	| episode2 |	On your Wi-Fi account
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:54,047	| episode2 |	Also to make sure that the devices you buy
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:57,119	| episode2 |	Research them beforehand
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:58,399	| episode2 |	And make sure that they are sick
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:00,191	| episode2 |	Secure in that could be as simple as
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,471	| episode2 |	Looking up
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,239	| episode2 |	Wink hub
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:04,031	| episode2 |	Secure
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:04,543	| episode2 |	Or
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:06,335	| episode2 |	Kwikset door lock
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,359	| episode2 |	Secure
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:10,431	| episode2 |	And then keeping your firmware up to date
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:15,039	| episode2 |	I was just going to say that I don't know about you but I tend to set my devices up
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:20,415	| episode2 |	For auto detection of new firmware updates and Auto download and even Auto install if I can
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:26,815	| episode2 |	I know that could actually introduce a problem as opposed to help solve the problem but I feel a little bit safer knowing I do
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,839	| episode2 |	Don't need to maintain the stuff
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,887	| episode2 |	You know every single day
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:32,447	| episode2 |	That's actually a really good
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,727	| episode2 |	Best practice
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:34,751	| episode2 |	Especially
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,543	| episode2 |	Especially with the
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:38,079	| episode2 |	Smart home because some of these things
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,103	| episode2 |	Can actually come on
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,919	| episode2 |	It update when you're not
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,199	| episode2 |	Write about using cuz
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,991	| episode2 |	There is nothing more frustrating than b
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,039	| episode2 |	Haven to turn on my lights
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:48,575	| episode2 |	No you're not
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,855	| episode2 |	The firmware update
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,183	| episode2 |	I just need a light
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:54,463	| episode2 |	I don't need firmware
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:58,815	| episode2 |	I can't read my book because my firmware is out of date
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,327	| episode2 |	Exactly
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:03,167	| episode2 |	I'm trying to show my friends my really awesome lights
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:04,703	| episode2 |	And they're like
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,215	| episode2 |	Yeah this is

EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:44,895	| episode2 |	That fits in
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,431	| episode2 |	The palm of both of you

EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,655	| episode2 |	It changes colors
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,191	| episode2 |	It dims
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:10,239	| episode2 |	It's connected via the app
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:12,031	| episode2 |	So it can work with other lighting rest
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:12,799	| episode2 |	Recipes
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,567	| episode2 |	It's kind of like
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,335	| episode2 |	The same shape is
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,103	| episode2 |	Friends of hue
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,127	| episode2 |	Too late if you guys are
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:16,639	| episode2 |	Familiar with those
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,455	| episode2 |	So it can rest flat on the ground and
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:19,967	| episode2 |	Like the bowl like
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,271	| episode2 |	Or you can tilt it
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,831	| episode2 |	And it's got a little stand that you
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,343	| episode2 |	Tilted up and then you
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,623	| episode2 |	Shine it up with
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,135	| episode2 |	Against the wall
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:29,183	| episode2 |	So if you have like a boring white wall
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:30,975	| episode2 |	You could actually turn the light
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,655	| episode2 |	You can highlight nice artwork you have on a wall
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:44,031	| episode2 |	There's all kinds of things you can do what makes this interesting is that it's completely wireless and I don't mean just from
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:46,847	| episode2 |	Being I am assuming it's wifi-connected it is
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,615	| episode2 |	Like all Hue Lights
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,151	| episode2 |	Is it be connected
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,199	| episode2 |	Got
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,223	| episode2 |	It
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,527	| episode2 |	Connect via the Hub
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,295	| episode2 |	Your Wi-Fi Hub
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,087	| episode2 |	It connects
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:58,623	| episode2 |	To EUR
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,647	| episode2 |	Wi-Fi networks at the house
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,439	| episode2 |	Right but the other
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:06,047	| episode2 |	Pardes from a power standpoint it is Wireless as well as a rechargeable battery inside
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:10,399	| episode2 |	So you can literally take this little light bowl anywhere you want
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:16,287	| episode2 |	Put it on a nightstand in the kids room put it like I said you up against the wall to show artwork and so on
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:20,639	| episode2 |	You can if you're doing work in the garage and utility light maybe you can use it for that
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:21,663	| episode2 |	You can go anywhere
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:26,271	| episode2 |	However I asked AC before the show how long does that battery last
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,319	| episode2 |	Go ahead
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:31,903	| episode2 |	Philip says it guarantees 3 hours off its base
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:35,999	| episode2 |	I had it on for about four and a half hours
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,023	| episode2 |	And it was doing
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,791	| episode2 |	Just fine
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,583	| episode2 |	And because it's an LED
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:40,863	| episode2 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,143	| episode2 |	Dim it just
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:42,911	| episode2 |	It's on
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:44,959	| episode2 |	Tree binary
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:49,823	| episode2 |	And you know I would also say like this light
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:50,591	| episode2 |	Sense8
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,871	| episode2 |	Came and we turned it on and plugged
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,151	| episode2 |	And it has not been
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,431	| episode2 |	In my head
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,991	| episode2 |	My daughter has been using it is
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:57,759	| episode2 |	Is a prop in
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:58,271	| episode2 |	Just about every
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,831	| episode2 |	It's been a crystal ball she
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:01,855	| episode2 |	She stuck it in the bottom of
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,623	| episode2 |	Cauldron
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,647	| episode2 |	Animated witches brew
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:06,975	| episode2 |	So I can see this coming in really handy Act
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:13,887	| episode2 |	I think I think there is a target audience in kids there because it looks simple-to-use
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:20,031	| episode2 |	If you can control it through the smartphone app that you were showing me before the show there's even a button on it that you can change the color of the light
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:27,455	| episode2 |	Right off the bat and my kids were getting when they were younger they were getting these colored light bulbs to put a mood in their room but now
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:32,063	| episode2 |	Now something like this on the kids nightstands or they can play to their hearts content
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:34,111	| episode2 |	I could see a big a big audience there
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:38,207	| episode2 |	Shirley Phillips actually has Partnerships they have these lights that they

EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,887	| episode2 |	That changes the light with the story
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:47,679	| episode2 |	The book and it's like a special
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,727	| episode2 |	Light + storybook thing
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:52,031	| episode2 |	With something like this you would just
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,311	| episode2 |	Download a story app

EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,591	| episode2 |	Yeah Amazon Dash This is
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:11,711	| episode2 |	It's interesting I'll give Amazon that and it fits within their whole e-commerce
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:13,503	| episode2 |	We want to sell you everything
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,527	| episode2 |	Mantra
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:19,391	| episode2 |	4 people who aren't aware of the dash I think it's by invite only for Prime members right now
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:23,743	| episode2 |	And I do not have one I am a Prime member but I haven't requested an invite
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:26,559	| episode2 |	These are little sticky buttons basically
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,071	| episode2 |	That
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,119	| episode2 |	When you press the button
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:33,983	| episode2 |	You will actually order something from Amazon and that something is very specific
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:38,847	| episode2 |	Like on their site to show a picture of the dash button with the Tide logo tide
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:41,151	| episode2 |	Laundry detergent which
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:41,919	| episode2 |	We happened to use
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:46,783	| episode2 |	A theoretically ever get one of these I would stick the tide dash button on my
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,063	| episode2 |	Washing machine
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:51,135	| episode2 |	And when I'm running low on type I press the button
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,671	| episode2 |	An Amazon
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:54,719	| episode2 |	Places the order for more tied to my house
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:57,535	| episode2 |	And Amazon has
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,583	| episode2 |	17 Brands already
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:03,167	| episode2 |	So some of the brands that they have so far is
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:05,471	| episode2 |	Tide as you mentioned
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:06,495	| episode2 |	They have
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,543	| episode2 |	Cottonelle
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,567	| episode2 |	Bounce
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:13,663	| episode2 |	Kraft macaroni and cheese why didn't I just saw that we were not at all the time
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:14,943	| episode2 |	See you can
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:18,271	| episode2 |	You can
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:21,087	| episode2 |	And Oil of Olay to oh my goodness I've got everything covered
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:24,159	| episode2 |	Yeah your Oil of Olay Beauty bars
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,743	| episode2 |	I think this is
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,791	| episode2 |	So what I saw this I was like
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:33,119	| episode2 |	That's weird when a lot of people saw this they thought it was a
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,143	| episode2 |	April Fool's Day joke
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:34,655	| episode2 |	They did
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,447	| episode2 |	I wish I had I thought
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:39,007	| episode2 |	No no this makes total sense people love buttons
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:43,103	| episode2 |	And I saw in the New Yorker actually had a really great
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:43,615	| episode2 |	Take on this
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:47,711	| episode2 |	One of the writers there wrote a store
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:51,039	| episode2 |	Hot take about this and they're like
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:53,855	| episode2 |	This is basically reducing friction even more
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:55,903	| episode2 |	And
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:59,999	| episode2 |	Every time you run out of something you have the choice basically to not buy it at
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,023	| episode2 |	Armada switch brands
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,815	| episode2 |	So this is great for Amazon
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:07,423	| episode2 |	You never run out so you never have to make that choice
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:07,935	| episode2 |	Maybe I don't know
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:08,959	| episode2 |	Maybe I should switch
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:13,055	| episode2 |	So by pressing that button your
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,591	| episode2 |	You're basically like
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,615	| episode2 |	Consumerism
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:17,663	| episode2 |	Keep going if it's Amazon
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:22,015	| episode2 |	You know standard operating procedure and what they're in business for I totally get it
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:24,319	| episode2 |	It does reduce friction I could see that
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,087	| episode2 |	I
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:29,439	| episode2 |	Don't think I'll go with any of these even I see some of the products that we use
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,975	| episode2 |	I anticipate
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:32,255	| episode2 |	Some more
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:35,327	| episode2 |	Amazon Smartwatch apps that will
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:37,631	| episode2 |	Let me just speak my order
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,935	| episode2 |	You've already got the echo
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,471	| episode2 |	So you can see erratically
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,239	| episode2 |	Order from
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:44,543	| episode2 |	Your Echo with us I would imagine
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:48,895	| episode2 |	As opposed to having lots of little button stuck around your house yeah that's the thing cuz all these buttons
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:49,663	| episode2 |	I know
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:56,831	| episode2 |	I know that they are not making a lot of noise cuz 99.9% of the time they're not doing anything is not until you hit that button that
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:58,879	| episode2 |	Any data is going through my home network and whatnot
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:04,767	| episode2 |	And I didn't look into the technical way you know how these buttons connected to a Wi-Fi network I presume so
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,535	| episode2 |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:11,935	| episode2 |	And I don't I don't know that I want more items on my Wi-Fi network unless I unless they're high value items is what I
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:12,959	| episode2 |	I guess I would want to say
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:15,775	| episode2 |	I don't want I look at my Wi-Fi
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:22,431	| episode2 |	No address table now and there's got to be close to 80 or 90 items on their between tablets and phones and
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:26,271	| episode2 |	Xboxes in Connected TVs and iPads and
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,551	| episode2 |	Laptops and
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:30,367	| episode2 |	I mean I just don't want to clutter that up
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:35,743	| episode2 |	So you're going to really hate the second part of this so the dash buttons are Amazon's retro
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:39,839	| episode2 |	What's really interesting about their announcement
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,887	| episode2 |	A lot of people didn't focus on beak
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,655	| episode2 |	Because the buttons are so
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:45,727	| episode2 |	Impressum is the
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:50,079	| episode2 |	The second half which is the Amazon replenishment service
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:51,103	| episode2 |	Part
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:55,455	| episode2 |	And that is a program and the first devices will be coming out in the fall
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:58,271	| episode2 |	But Amazon's got Partnerships with
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,551	| episode2 |	Companies like Brita
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:00,575	| episode2 |	Like the Water Filter Company
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:01,343	| episode2 |	Brother printer
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,135	| episode2 |	Corky
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:04,159	| episode2 |	Which makes all these
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,719	| episode2 |	Quirky connected devices
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:09,535	| episode2 |	And other products I see what you did there
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:11,839	| episode2 |	And
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,119	| episode2 |	Whirlpool even
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,655	| episode2 |	To integrate
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:17,983	| episode2 |	Basically the capabilities to reorder from am
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:20,799	| episode2 |	Into a hardwired button
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,567	| episode2 |	I'm inside
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,079	| episode2 |	A machine
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,359	| episode2 |	So
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:25,663	| episode2 |	And you can either have a physical button
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,687	| episode2 |	Hardwired
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:31,039	| episode2 |	Or it is something that automatically detects when you're out
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,831	| episode2 |	Andre orders like that
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:34,623	| episode2 |	Now that you don't even do it
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,647	| episode2 |	But
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,927	| episode2 |	They're going to have a device that
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:40,255	| episode2 |	Still on your network so Corky's launching
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,279	| episode2 |	A pet feeder
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:41,791	| episode2 |	For example
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:44,351	| episode2 |	So this is something you stick
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,887	| episode2 |	Keep or the pet food into the
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,167	| episode2 |	Automatic pet
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:50,751	| episode2 |	Peter and then suddenly when it's
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:52,031	| episode2 |	Runnin low it's going to be like
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,311	| episode2 |	Your Amazon
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,103	| episode2 |	Pet food for shelter
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:55,615	| episode2 |	At your door you don't do
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:19:01,247	| episode2 |	And I like that you know what I'd like the end result it's just the implementation
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:08,159	| episode2 |	And it's personal thing is this isn't gonna bother everybody I know that I almost wish they were either Bluetooth or
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:09,439	| episode2 |	60 buttons
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:11,487	| episode2 |	That went to a single Hub or switch
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,279	| episode2 |	Through my phone to my Amazon account
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:16,351	| episode2 |	As opposed to all these individual WiFi devices
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:22,239	| episode2 |	So you're at your issue is just that it's I mean you could call if your Wi-Fi router the
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:27,871	| episode2 |	I could call it that but it wouldn't change anything
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:29,663	| episode2 |	You're right I could
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:30,431	| episode2 |	But I won't
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:34,271	| episode2 |	Okay so so you just don't want it going straight to
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,295	| episode2 |	Cloud
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:41,183	| episode2 |	Not not that I don't want all these individual WiFi devices
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:43,231	| episode2 |	For for individual items
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:49,631	| episode2 |	That I might purchase like I'm looking at the 17 items we use bounty we use Clorox wipes I go through Gatorade
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,911	| episode2 |	Like you wouldn't believe
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:55,519	| episode2 |	Tide we go through type mac and cheese come on everybody goes to mac and cheese
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:57,823	| episode2 |	It's not the items but think of
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:03,711	| episode2 |	Do I want a button for every one of these and every one of the buttons is a separate Wi-Fi item on my network
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:05,247	| episode2 |	No I don't want that
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:10,111	| episode2 |	That's really interesting cuz I was thinking by my immediately went to the waist for 10
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:12,415	| episode2 |	God what if I
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:16,767	| episode2 |	On Tuesday I I hit the tide button and then on Wednesday I hit the mac and cheese
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:19,327	| episode2 |	And then I'm thinking about like
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,119	| episode2 |	All the packaging that comes in
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:21,887	| episode2 |	I'd rather have the
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:25,215	| episode2 |	Orders held in aggravated but you're like
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:33,407	| episode2 |	It's very odd to me that you're focused on the device you are saving the planet I'm saving my network
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:39,807	| episode2 |	What we we do Amy we order from Amazon at least once a week if not
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:41,087	| episode2 |	Twice
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:43,391	| episode2 |	We tend to bundle things UPS
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:46,207	| episode2 |	For that reason I mean we try not to be frivolous
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:46,975	| episode2 |	With that.
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:52,095	| episode2 |	You know the the shipping in the packing cuz that is a big part of our life and we do try to stay aware of that
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:52,863	| episode2 |	So
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:56,447	| episode2 |	I guess I didn't think that far ahead yet I was just thinking of my own network but
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,215	| episode2 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:58,751	| episode2 |	But I don't want
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:02,335	| episode2 |	Packaging and FedEx or UPS here everyday just to
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:05,919	| episode2 |	Bring me something I can actually go down the street in a mile and a half and go get anyway so
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:11,039	| episode2 |	Okay will close out the episode now that we've
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:15,647	| episode2 |	We each had our own like weird issues with the dash
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:17,952	| episode2 |	I still kind of excited about it I
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:20,256	| episode2 |	I've applied so I'm hopeful that I will
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:21,792	| episode2 |	A dash
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:24,096	| episode2 |	Submit a recommendation let me know

EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:08,384	| episode2 |	And he is also the CTO of sonatype
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:10,176	| episode2 |	Hey Josh how you doing today
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:11,712	| episode2 |	I'm doing well
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:15,040	| episode2 |	All right well I Ask Josh here because
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:16,320	| episode2 |	I am the calvary
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:17,856	| episode2 |	Is a
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:24,512	| episode2 |	Security type organization and I say security type organization which is so vague because I'm going to have him tell you a little bit more about it
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,048	| episode2 |	Sure
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:32,960	| episode2 |	We started I am the Cavalry official launch was at Defcon 21 so largest hacker conference in the world which is
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,240	| episode2 |	August of 2013
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:37,056	| episode2 |	And it came from some of the
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:40,896	| episode2 |	The members of the security community that had noticed that our
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:47,296	| episode2 |	Our basic problem statement that unified us was that our dependence on connected technology was growing a lot faster than
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,320	| episode2 |	Our ability to secure it
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:54,464	| episode2 |	And while many of us got in a hacking culture as a hobby we weren't paying attention it became our profession
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:23:01,376	| episode2 |	But we noticed over the last five years is that once again weren't paying attention and now software and vulnerable software was
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:04,704	| episode2 |	Is going into our cars are medical devices are homes
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:06,240	| episode2 |	Our critical infrastructure
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:09,824	| episode2 |	And wow 80 billion dollars is spent a year to protect
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:14,432	| episode2 |	Credit cards and it's an abject failure I mean most of us have had a credit card compromised
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:19,296	| episode2 |	The failure rate for the merchants for example or Enterprise security is nearly 100%
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:22,368	| episode2 |	And what we said is we're now putting up
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:27,232	| episode2 |	Marble connected technology into things that affect our families are Public Safety in human life
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,536	| episode2 |	So few of us quietly
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:36,448	| episode2 |	Work used our careers and our credibility to get it high and deep as we could in the government and intelligence community
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:43,360	| episode2 |	Internationally domestically and what we found is we we naively believed that if you got his hind if you can get and get the right
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:46,176	| episode2 |	Message the right stakeholders they would quote-unquote fix it
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,224	| episode2 |	But after doing so
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:49,760	| episode2 |	It was obvious that
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,040	| episode2 |	Even they weren't
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:53,856	| episode2 |	Informed are empowered enough to do anything
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:57,696	| episode2 |	And it was so boring and what we said to ourselves as you know the Cavalry isn't coming
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,976	| episode2 |	No one's going to come save us
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:01,536	| episode2 |	And this is simultaneously
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:04,352	| episode2 |	Destroy your confidence but also is empowering
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:06,912	| episode2 |	Because it says what they
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,704	| episode2 |	Can't do it it falls to us to try
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:15,616	| episode2 |	I am the Cavalry was really a personal declaration that I can Scream the darkness or I can be a part of the
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,384	| episode2 |	Absolution
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:21,760	| episode2 |	Emily challenge the hacker Community to do to a Grassroots non-profit
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:22,784	| episode2 |	Renovation was
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:29,952	| episode2 |	Let's be a voice of reason and Technical literacy and let's fix the the education in the public in the
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:32,256	| episode2 |	Public policy makers in the affected Industries
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:36,864	| episode2 |	Because in a real knowledge Gap and if we can beat at ambassador
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,888	| episode2 |	That we can help
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:40,448	| episode2 |	Speak to them in their terms and elevate
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:42,752	| episode2 |	During staining them will make smarter choices
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:45,824	| episode2 |	We're not against technology when I'm saying smash all your iot
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:52,480	| episode2 |	But what we see is that where we place dependence on this connected technology and we want to ensure that's worthy of our trust in at the moment is now
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:55,552	| episode2 |	Okay so you've told me
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:58,624	| episode2 |	The basically what we're doing we're putting computers in places where there
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:01,696	| episode2 |	Have not been computers before and so
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:05,536	| episode2 |	Software you told me makes the things vulnerable and connecting it to the internet
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,304	| episode2 |	Makes it exposed
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:07,840	| episode2 |	So
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:09,120	| episode2 |	Kind of given that
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:13,472	| episode2 |	You started this organization and you said that there are four seas to your
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:14,752	| episode2 |	What are those forces
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:18,848	| episode2 |	It's collecting connecting collaborating catalyzing
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:21,920	| episode2 |	And it's not just something we say it's it's how our
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:24,736	| episode2 |	Approaching this this value in this Mission so we collect
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:29,856	| episode2 |	Existing research and researchers so we don't have to reinvent the wheel there's a large body of work
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,648	| episode2 |	That has been done
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:34,976	| episode2 |	By solo artists but we believe it to be stronger if we collect them
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:37,536	| episode2 |	We connect them to each other
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:41,120	| episode2 |	For the first time in a long time turns out there's quite a few car hackers for example
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:47,264	| episode2 |	I will also connect them with willing teammates in the automotive industry or medical device for example
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:50,336	| episode2 |	We try to cause some form of
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:54,432	| episode2 |	Working groups in collaboration whether it's for an individual company
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:56,224	| episode2 |	Or whether it's an industry initiative
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:58,016	| episode2 |	And we try to catalyze
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:02,880	| episode2 |	Action that would not have happened otherwise I would not have happened as soon had we not tried
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:10,048	| episode2 |	And what we don't want to do is simply admire or describe the problem what we want to do is cause safer out
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:10,560	| episode2 |	Come sooner
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,608	| episode2 |	And those four seas
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:14,656	| episode2 |	I've been pretty successful
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,960	| episode2 |	I'm primarily in the automotive
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:19,520	| episode2 |	And the medical device product is hot on a scale
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,312	| episode2 |	Okay so
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:22,592	| episode2 |	You guys have been doing this
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,872	| episode2 |	For about 20 months
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:25,408	| episode2 |	And
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:31,296	| episode2 |	It obviously Detroit has been one of your kind of Automotive space has been really good for y'all so far
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,088	| episode2 |	In those 20 months
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:34,880	| episode2 |	What have you
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:35,392	| episode2 |	Done
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:40,256	| episode2 |	So we're taking a Long View on this and we know that some of this is building Trust
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,536	| episode2 |	So
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:42,560	| episode2 |	We're not going to see
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:45,632	| episode2 |	Super awesome immediate results we have seen a few
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:48,192	| episode2 |	I was talking about the first nine months
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:50,496	| episode2 |	Signing those willing allies and teammates
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:55,872	| episode2 |	Are first birthday we published an open letter to the car CEOs through writers
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:27:03,040	| episode2 |	And with it we published at Five Star Automotive cyber-safety framework or we basically said look you guys have been making
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:05,856	| episode2 |	Safety improvements over the last 50 years India
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:08,416	| episode2 |	Actually care about driving safety into your products
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:10,720	| episode2 |	Are your Masters at your domain
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:12,256	| episode2 |	We are masters of our domain
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,792	| episode2 |	And now that our demands are cloudy
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:16,608	| episode2 |	Collider Bergen of the safest outcomes is soonest if we work together
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:20,192	| episode2 |	This framework of five foundational capabilities
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:25,312	| episode2 |	Because if a car is now computer on Wheels there in in Harry a lot of the
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:31,456	| episode2 |	Similar adversaries attack services but the difference being that the consequences of failure far more severe
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:34,016	| episode2 |	So that begin
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,808	| episode2 |	The more overt public
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:37,856	| episode2 |	Collaboration right behind the scenes weed help
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:39,904	| episode2 |	People with their structure design
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,952	| episode2 |	You saw
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:48,352	| episode2 |	Fruits of Labor such as that the Tesla car company published according disclosure policy saying it would not see third-party res
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:50,656	| episode2 |	Researchers that was amazing staff that we're hoping
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:53,216	| episode2 |	Bothering others in industry emulate
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:57,056	| episode2 |	But let's talk about your framework before we get to the Tesla stuff because
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,104	| episode2 |	That actually follows
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:27:59,872	| episode2 |	Some of your framework
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:03,968	| episode2 |	We got to we got to tell people what it is before they get all excited about it
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:12,160	| episode2 |	So you know actually put this in a tweet once but the more verbose version is on the site but the idea is we think it's a
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:14,208	| episode2 |	Forgiving the all systems fail
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:17,536	| episode2 |	I think anyone with any sort of engineering background knows this intrinsically
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:20,352	| episode2 |	So giving it all systems fail is not an issue
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:21,632	| episode2 |	Cars will be hacked it's
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:23,424	| episode2 |	That when they are
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:25,984	| episode2 |	Whether it's three accidents are adversaries
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:28,288	| episode2 |	We want to have it ready posture
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:30,592	| episode2 |	So these five are foundational
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:35,456	| episode2 |	Activities and capabilities that any should have some when I put them in a tweet it said how do you
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:37,248	| episode2 |	Avoid failure
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:41,088	| episode2 |	Take help avoiding failure learn from failure respond to failure and isolate failure
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:42,880	| episode2 |	But that the five
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:45,184	| episode2 |	Verbosely on the site or do you have a published
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:51,840	| episode2 |	Attestation of high do safety by Design so what steps are you taking much like Microsoft does with their famous STL
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:55,680	| episode2 |	To keep your customers safe when they're cyber cyber physical system
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:29:01,056	| episode2 |	Number two says look when I miss stuff so you won't engage willing allies acting in good faith
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:02,592	| episode2 |	And we therefore have a
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:06,176	| episode2 |	Policy saying we will not Sue third-party researchers who report
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:12,064	| episode2 |	Bugs to us in a predictable way and there's two ISO standards already on how to do coordinates closure
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:18,464	| episode2 |	They don't have to reinvent the wheel they're the third one's pretty darn important it's think of it like tamper-evident frantically sound evidence
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:20,512	| episode2 |	Capture like a black box in an airplane
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:23,584	| episode2 |	Will a car companies simultaneously crying that there were
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:26,144	| episode2 |	There was no evidence of of hacking
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:31,264	| episode2 |	In the field and yet none of them that were making that claim had any ability to notice if they had ever been hacked
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:37,920	| episode2 |	So at least the foundation capacity we should be able to see tamper evidence and have it be Court admissible evidence
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:44,320	| episode2 |	So we can start to learn in the Auto industry much like we do every time a plane crash it really critical one that a couple companies
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:45,856	| episode2 |	Have other ones are elected to do
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:49,184	| episode2 |	Is the respondent failure and that's really do you have secure updates
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:55,328	| episode2 |	Now you lead us to be over the air and Tesla provides this and I think you can save some of the recent BMW compromised
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:30:02,240	| episode2 |	I'd actually fixed the Bonneville software over the air before they even announced their customers that they were honorable so that things
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:08,640	| episode2 |	Example of a response in days or weeks as opposed to months or years which may be the case he requires a physical
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,152	| episode2 |	Recall
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:12,736	| episode2 |	Any isolate failures at CIA
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:15,552	| episode2 |	Tell us how you separate critical from non-critical systems
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:20,416	| episode2 |	Right now for example there's so much flat conductivity in the vehicles that
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:24,000	| episode2 |	It's possible that a compromise of the radio or the infotainment system
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:30,912	| episode2 |	Could turn the steering wheel or disable brakes and what we want to do is separate critical or non-critical systems either with logical or physical
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,424	| episode2 |	Isolation
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:36,288	| episode2 |	I so that when the inevitable compromise happens
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:42,688	| episode2 |	The full reach of the damage is contained and we don't think of this is like a PCI checklist of if I do these things I'm done
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:48,320	| episode2 |	Adidas foundational table states that when you add connected technology to things that can kill people
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:49,856	| episode2 |	These are the must-haves and where
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:54,976	| episode2 |	Aggressively trying to cause he's that become table stakes in an automotive Medical
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:56,000	| episode2 |	And other areas
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:59,072	| episode2 |	So these are the bare minimum so you should start here
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:00,864	| episode2 |	And then from there
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:03,680	| episode2 |	You like everybody's designing from the same space
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:06,752	| episode2 |	And then from there is where you start building on kind of
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:12,896	| episode2 |	Damn you think about it we're taking all the attack surface from software
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:14,432	| episode2 |	And Enterprise computing
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:18,272	| episode2 |	You know some of the vehicles were vulnerable the same in some of the same open source
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:20,832	| episode2 |	Flies that like are played right if
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:22,624	| episode2 |	You're going to use something that's
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:28,768	| episode2 |	Going to give you functionality from the private sector from other use cases and it's going to get compromised
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:35,424	| episode2 |	En masse in the public and you lack the ability to do anything updated you got the attack surface but you don't have
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:39,264	| episode2 |	The copper bowl Windows update or or Mac OS update
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:43,616	| episode2 |	So with this dependence on digital infrastructure comes
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:48,480	| episode2 |	Another responsibility to to maintain it and have a prompt and I'd life cycle like
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,016	| episode2 |	Anything else
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:53,088	| episode2 |	When he different so is you have to look at credit cards
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:59,488	| episode2 |	Is an acceptable fraud rate annually in as long as that industry stays within that acceptable fraud rate whether it's 4%
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:00,768	| episode2 |	Or whatnot
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:05,888	| episode2 |	Then you're okay if I asked you to Stacy what's an acceptable failure rate for your family's safety
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,704	| episode2 |	I guess it depends on the system I mean like
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:09,728	| episode2 |	My brakes
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,008	| episode2 |	Gosh
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:11,776	| episode2 |	Nothing
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,800	| episode2 |	Brighton
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:15,360	| episode2 |	Isn't my maps or GPS
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:17,664	| episode2 |	You know
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:20,992	| episode2 |	For me probably it's pretty high cuz it's not like I know where I'm going anyway but
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:23,808	| episode2 |	Well I mean
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:30,208	| episode2 |	Fair enough but I think that's one reason for these 5 being necessary because right now perhaps a compromise of an a
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:36,096	| episode2 |	A Pandora app store or your GPS may seem benign but can be a pivot point to your brakes
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,120	| episode2 |	And your steering
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:39,168	| episode2 |	You were recently in Detroit and
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:43,776	| episode2 |	Tell me a little bit about that so so far what is the industry kind of response been to
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,312	| episode2 |	This
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:45,824	| episode2 |	Primark
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:52,992	| episode2 |	Well you know they're very new to this issue so they're going it's almost like Microsoft from 15-20 years ago they're afraid
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:55,296	| episode2 |	Play the share they're afraid to talk about what they're doing
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:33:00,416	| episode2 |	Right now the narrative is controlled by the public hacking on the news and The Sensational headlines
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:01,184	| episode2 |	Joe
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:07,584	| episode2 |	Many of them are pretty good things but none of them were talking about it so it's a very one-sided narrative I think in
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:09,632	| episode2 |	One week you had 6 minutes
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:12,960	| episode2 |	I was at the time I was like the BMW hack was announced
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:18,592	| episode2 |	NBA she wrote analysis why that was a success story and how they were embracing at least some of the framework
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:21,920	| episode2 |	And the BMW Hack That was was that over the OBD port
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:28,832	| episode2 |	Now this was they had something like an OnStar system that allowed you to maybe call and say hey my
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:30,880	| episode2 |	I locked myself out of my car can you let me in
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,904	| episode2 |	And
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:35,488	| episode2 |	Some researchers found the ability to compromise that
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:36,768	| episode2 |	So
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:40,864	| episode2 |	In the process of accepting that third-party collaboration without sending them
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:45,216	| episode2 |	They work behind the scenes they shouldn't over the air update before they told him was broken
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:50,080	| episode2 |	And in the process of doing so they also realize that they're over there update mechanism was passing
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:54,176	| episode2 |	Things in the clear so they also migrated to using http
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:58,784	| episode2 |	To me it's like these guys are already dependent on kinetic technology
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:04,928	| episode2 |	And we want to do is put them on a path for that virtuous upward spiral and that learning and continuous improvement process
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:08,768	| episode2 |	So while we are a bit mortified at some of the failures that
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,816	| episode2 |	Allowed under the compromise to happen
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:16,704	| episode2 |	We are really pleased at how elegant the response was they use it as an opportunity to bring themselves but also
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:20,288	| episode2 |	By disclosing some of those details in ways they didn't have to
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:22,080	| episode2 |	They also let the industry get a little smarter
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:24,384	| episode2 |	So you know that happen.
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:27,968	| episode2 |	A few days later the 60 Minutes piece showing DARPA
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:28,992	| episode2 |	Attacking
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:32,320	| episode2 |	Cars without physical contact is that the one that cliches is that
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:35,648	| episode2 |	What always requires physical access they did it without physical access
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:42,304	| episode2 |	Myself and I Craig Smith Grand open garages we did one on NBC New York Road that the journalist
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:45,376	| episode2 |	Was manipulating a vehicle from New York
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,144	| episode2 |	30 Rock
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:48,704	| episode2 |	All the way to Seattle so 3000 miles away
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:49,728	| episode2 |	They're not manipulation
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:55,104	| episode2 |	Alexandra markina Massachusetts announced his in his report for hacking and tracking
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:35:02,272	| episode2 |	Which took a year-long investigation into the state of security for the automotive industry Street in a lot of heat and light at the same time
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:02,784	| episode2 |	Time
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:06,880	| episode2 |	Any parallel we've been trying to build trust relationships with the
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:10,976	| episode2 |	Groups like the software Society of Automotive Engineers SAE
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:15,584	| episode2 |	We're just paying their working groups I've done things with Department of Homeland Security in DHS for connected

EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:20,448	| episode2 |	Solis worth it worth trying to harmonize on
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:21,984	| episode2 |	Instead of
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:28,384	| episode2 |	A bunch of private Solutions everyone seems to be talking about this five-star is the lowest common denominator or Lisa
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,152	| episode2 |	Some sort of
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:32,992	| episode2 |	Common Ground everyone could could strive to implement
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:35,808	| episode2 |	No cars are designed
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:37,088	| episode2 |	Sometimes five years out
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,136	| episode2 |	Some of the technologies that goes into
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,672	| episode2 |	And so
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:46,560	| episode2 |	When realistically am I going to see a safer vehicle on the road how much is this is going to be
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:48,608	| episode2 |	Implemented in time
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:52,192	| episode2 |	Well it's a unevenly distributed right
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:53,216	| episode2 |	It's a
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:59,616	| episode2 |	Some of the vehicles already have over the air updates some of them was Tesla alluded to earlier they have a pump
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:00,384	| episode2 |	List Cornell
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:01,920	| episode2 |	Disclosure policy so
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:06,272	| episode2 |	Researchers are encouraged to find a random issues which is going to make them smarter and safer sooner
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:11,904	| episode2 |	Other car companies have a lot of stuff in the works but yeah you're absolutely right I asked a simple question
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:15,232	| episode2 |	There's a scenario that many of the people in history have known about for years which is
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:19,584	| episode2 |	That the remote kill switch allows you to remotely disable stolen vehicle
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:21,632	| episode2 |	Honest used in different ways different countries
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:24,960	| episode2 |	And a lot of them are implemented in securely
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:26,496	| episode2 |	And I can't be patched or updated
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:31,872	| episode2 |	So I said look at it we're just kind of all waiting with his Sword of Damocles like who's going to
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:35,200	| episode2 |	Disable a fleet of vehicles or emergency response vehicles
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:36,736	| episode2 |	Or gridlock a city
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:43,136	| episode2 |	Yeah this is going to have a crisis of confidence in the consumer population if they no longer trust their cars so
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,672	| episode2 |	Let's say that you you get hacked
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:50,304	| episode2 |	It's your company this is a back in November I asked about eight of them were sitting around having coffee during the breaks
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:54,656	| episode2 |	And they were competitors and I said so if yours is hacked tomorrow and you're on the news
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:58,752	| episode2 |	What's a stop you from being the next BP oil spill that just gushing
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:37:00,544	| episode2 |	And gushing for days and weeks
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:04,640	| episode2 |	And none of them really had a good answer so I can let me phrase it this way
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,688	| episode2 |	If yours was hacked tomorrow
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:09,760	| episode2 |	And you're on the news tomorrow what's your minimum
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:12,576	| episode2 |	Response time best casement and response time
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:14,368	| episode2 |	Andeavor crickets
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:15,904	| episode2 |	When you can hear a pin drop
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:22,816	| episode2 |	And one of them said all right I'll go first let's just face it in 2018 models are already done his best first answer
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:25,376	| episode2 |	2018 models are already done
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:26,144	| episode2 |	Notice there was no
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:28,448	| episode2 |	Something that they could do it over the air update
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:34,592	| episode2 |	And then somebody else said yeah it's actually worse than that cuz they're a third-party supply chain is done through 20/20 on cases
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:39,712	| episode2 |	So you're talkin multiple-year response time if something is serious is
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:43,040	| episode2 |	Kill sweatshirt brakes being shut off on mass were to happen tomorrow
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:46,880	| episode2 |	Do we already have the weakness the question is are we ready
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:48,928	| episode2 |	To respond that failure
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:54,816	| episode2 |	And all the sudden it dawned on them that okay wait you're not trying to post something on us it's actually really good
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:38:02,496	| episode2 |	If we can have a problem as a response to keys out of headlines not a material impact or stock price we're not the next embarrassing beep
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:03,264	| episode2 |	Coil spill
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:04,800	| episode2 |	One of actually pointed out
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:08,896	| episode2 |	You guys a lot less stigma on a software update in Arizona Factory
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:09,408	| episode2 |	Recall
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:12,480	| episode2 |	So I'm a little dismayed the fact that you know
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:14,016	| episode2 |	20/20
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:14,528	| episode2 |	Still
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:18,112	| episode2 |	5 years out and some automakers
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:20,928	| episode2 |	Are not able even if they wanted to to adapt
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:22,976	| episode2 |	Components of fitness
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:23,488	| episode2 |	So
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:28,352	| episode2 |	Yikes, take this framework cuz you've mentioned medical devices which
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:29,376	| episode2 |	Also important
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:32,192	| episode2 |	Are they a little farther along
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:37,568	| episode2 |	You know what the reason is sliced up these products the way we did is each have a different cohort of manufacturers
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:43,456	| episode2 |	They each have a different time to live for the technology so you know industrial controls Queens 30 years and cell phone that's too
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:47,040	| episode2 |	They also have different government
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:49,856	| episode2 |	Regulatory Frameworks in data structures so
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:56,768	| episode2 |	You know I look at the FDA the Food Drug Administration for medical devices and there isn't a lot of guidance or enforcement yet
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:39:00,352	| episode2 |	And it looks like an intractable problems on the reasons we lean towards car first
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:07,008	| episode2 |	But that's Edward we are finding different ways to catalyze growth are we looking bump purchasers like you know
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:11,616	| episode2 |	The Mayo Clinic is a fairly large influencer purchasers in evaluation so
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:17,504	| episode2 |	You know how the Mayo Clinic steers its its criteria has asymmetric impact on industry
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,808	| episode2 |	I'm looking at legislative
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:26,720	| episode2 |	I'm an executive branch options for medical so they all have their different challenges but we're very focused
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:32,352	| episode2 |	Start identifying that chain of influence and just like good white hat hackers were fussing the chain of influence and we're trying what works
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:33,376	| episode2 |	Per industry
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:37,472	| episode2 |	Diversity Automotive guys had a bigger Head Start without being required to
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:40,032	| episode2 |	We think that free market forces
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:43,104	| episode2 |	Are promising there with medical it's going to be
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:46,176	| episode2 |	A disruptive that ecosystem
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:48,480	| episode2 |	But we're focusing on what's reasonable on your
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:50,272	| episode2 |	You should see a five-star
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:54,624	| episode2 |	Medical save cyber-safety Frameworks suing that was very very similar because we think these
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:56,160	| episode2 |	Abstract capabilities
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:56,672	| episode2 |	Evergreen
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:59,744	| episode2 |	And good for all four projects
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:02,816	| episode2 |	Okay and what about the Smart Home
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:06,912	| episode2 |	So smartphones tougher in some ways because
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:13,568	| episode2 |	You know it's one thing to get like GM and Tesla a Nissan and Toyota to kind of changes only so many players
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:21,248	| episode2 |	The internet of everything right it's a whole Debbie of these Indiegogo Kickstarter size company
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:24,320	| episode2 |	Now I do feel that people like Sony in
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:25,088	| episode2 |	You know
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:26,880	| episode2 |	Kenmore and dularge
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:29,184	| episode2 |	Iot manufacturers are more likely
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:32,768	| episode2 |	To look like the response received from the automotive industry
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:35,072	| episode2 |	But I also think
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:41,472	| episode2 |	It's going to be a lot harder because there's different economics for these very very small devices with a very short time to live
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:44,800	| episode2 |	So it's in some ways a much harder problem
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:48,384	| episode2 |	But that's why groups like build it securely or Blitz. ILY
EDL	00:40:49,152	00:40:50,432	| episode2 |	I'm happily
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:56,576	| episode2 |	Specifically focused on that one's they can give a good reference architectures and good things to consider for anyone developing these

EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:20,384	| episode2 |	And I said I think our tactic there has been let's find the highest leverage watering holes whether it's the hardware platform
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:23,712	| episode2 |	Azure the development environments or the groups
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:26,784	| episode2 |	That people flock to you when they're designing developing these
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:29,600	| episode2 |	But that you know I looked at your excellent
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:32,672	| episode2 |	Television spot on your connected home
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:35,488	| episode2 |	And most of those were benign if they
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:40,352	| episode2 |	Compromise you but I am concerned that most of the Bluetooth door locks or
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:43,680	| episode2 |	Are about security systems have been compromised I think
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:46,752	| episode2 |	Leprechaun my co-founder both when he was at
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:49,824	| episode2 |	Trustwave running spiderlabs in his new role

EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:58,271	| episode2 |	Technology stock I don't think it's not a single one that they couldn't easily compromised so
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:41:59,295	| episode2 |	The batting averages
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:00,575	| episode2 |	Incredibly low
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:06,463	| episode2 |	And if you think about it we buy these Technologies to keep a people out of our homes and they may be the very thing that lets got people in their homes and

EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:13,887	| episode2 |	This is this is something and maybe this a good place to leave
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:14,911	| episode2 |	On I don't know
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:18,495	| episode2 |	I feel like most people when they buy these things
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:19,775	| episode2 |	They buy them too
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:21,823	| episode2 |	Not necessarily keep people out of their home like
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:23,615	| episode2 |	If I'm buying a
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:26,431	| episode2 |	A Bluetooth door lock I am
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,711	| episode2 |	Less interested in
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:33,599	| episode2 |	I mean I'm interested in locking my door but a door lock can be compromised whether or not it's connect
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:38,975	| episode2 |	You're not right it's actually much easier to break into my house via just just smashing the window then
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:44,607	| episode2 |	Packing my door lock right but the connected door lock gives me a lot more information and even a connected
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:46,143	| episode2 |	Security camera
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:46,655	| episode2 |	Brighten system
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:48,447	| episode2 |	Gives me a lot of info
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:52,543	| episode2 |	Information about who and what is in my home if my home is compromised
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:53,567	| episode2 |	And I think
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:56,127	| episode2 |	When you talk to people about those system
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:58,175	| episode2 |	They find them
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:42:59,455	| episode2 |	4
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:02,015	| episode2 |	That information as opposed to
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:04,319	| episode2 |	Why doesn't accept that their home is going to get
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:05,855	| episode2 |	Broken into
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:08,415	| episode2 |	They just want to understand
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:09,951	| episode2 |	That it's happened when it's happen
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:10,975	| episode2 |	Guess that makes sense
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:14,559	| episode2 |	I think it's kind of a subtle difference in
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:15,583	| episode2 |	How do you think about it
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:19,167	| episode2 |	But I think it's worth kind of understanding that
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:19,679	| episode2 |	Mindset
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:23,263	| episode2 |	In one of her foundational beliefs is that
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:29,151	| episode2 |	Again I didn't say we were LED lights in rear smash Oliver technology and go back to the Stone Age
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:32,735	| episode2 |	We think you know one of these I I put it I haven't lost you agree and
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:35,551	| episode2 |	I used to study
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:38,623	| episode2 |	Stuff like this in the different schools of thought in
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:44,767	| episode2 |	It's human nature to adopt things for their obvious immediate benefits but everything is a risk reward or cost-benefit equation
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:51,935	| episode2 |	And we're really really good at seeing the obvious instantaneous benefits but we're really really bad at calculating the less obvious
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:53,215	| episode2 |	Deferred cost
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:57,823	| episode2 |	And what we're doing is our our attitude in our address to adopt
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:59,103	| episode2 |	Anything and everything is
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:02,943	| episode2 |	We've got to stop doing that cost benefit analysis
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:08,063	| episode2 |	So if in fact the incremental risk introduced by technology is worth it
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:10,879	| episode2 |	For the the games are going to get by all means do so
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:13,439	| episode2 |	But we're not rendering very transparent
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:14,463	| episode2 |	What does
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:19,583	| episode2 |	Trade-offs are and we're not making very smart ones so it's not always more expensive for example
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:25,215	| episode2 |	To make something playlist hackable we finally found the guy you first the first Bluetooth on insulin pump
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:28,031	| episode2 |	Why the heck would you put a marble Bluetooth stack
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:30,335	| episode2 |	Are insulin pump that can kill somebody
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:36,735	| episode2 |	And there was no requirement to do so it was just kind of the bacon pretzel everything's better with bacon everything's better with Bluetooth and
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:42,623	| episode2 |	Once they put it there every competitor had to also have it and they all implemented them with a vulnerable stack
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:49,535	| episode2 |	It's like if you really want to do that either have it off by default or go through some some sort of threat modeling or adversaries
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:52,863	| episode2 |	Resilience testing so you can have the benefit of the Bluetooth in the convenience
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:54,399	| episode2 |	Without an elective
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:56,447	| episode2 |	Wide-open attack surface
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:57,727	| episode2 |	We war not against
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:45:03,871	| episode2 |	The benefits of is iot I mean the the geek in me wants more and more my home to be connected and controllable
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:07,711	| episode2 |	I just want to do it anyways where that risk is worth it
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:08,735	| episode2 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:10,271	| episode2 |	I am 100% with you
