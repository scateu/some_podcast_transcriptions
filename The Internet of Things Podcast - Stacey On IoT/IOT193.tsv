EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:43,776	| IOT193 |	We got tons of news bit such as a really cool consumer premise equipment from
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:45,056	| IOT193 |	A French is
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:48,128	| IOT193 |	We got new smart devices for the bedroom some

EDL	00:00:58,880	00:00:59,648	| IOT193 |	That
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:01,952	| IOT193 |	Is expensive but might be worth it for some people
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:04,256	| IOT193 |	And I guess this week is the
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:08,864	| IOT193 |	Ctio of the City of Calgary she's going to be talking about how these City
EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:10,912	| IOT193 |	Created its own Vortec
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:13,216	| IOT193 |	Sensor Network and what the heck they're doing with that
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:16,288	| IOT193 |	And what a message from our sponsor digicert
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:17,312	| IOT193 |	All of this
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:19,104	| IOT193 |	Is coming up
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:19,616	| IOT193 |	After a
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:21,408	| IOT193 |	Another one of our response
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:22,688	| IOT193 |	A pharaoh
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:24,736	| IOT193 |	Looking for an iot platform
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:26,784	| IOT193 |	Find out why Kenmore in dealing
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:30,112	| IOT193 |	The Pharaoh Pharaoh customers have experienced as much as
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:31,648	| IOT193 |	Is 80% reduction
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:32,672	| IOT193 |	And in time to Market
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:34,720	| IOT193 |	99% pure support
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:36,256	| IOT193 |	Antenna
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:37,280	| IOT193 |	What's higher activation
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:41,632	| IOT193 |	Plus they can we use 90% of their work from one project to the next
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:43,680	| IOT193 |	To learn more visit afero
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:45,472	| IOT193 |	That's a fer
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:46,240	| IOT193 |	Oh
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:47,264	| IOT193 |	Dot IO
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:49,568	| IOT193 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,592	| IOT193 |	Let's get this
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:52,128	| IOT193 |	Party started
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:53,152	| IOT193 |	Boo boo
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:53,664	| IOT193 |	With
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:54,944	| IOT193 |	Tracker
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:56,736	| IOT193 |	What is happening with tracker
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:58,528	| IOT193 |	Tracker
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:00,576	| IOT193 |	You may be familiar with to make
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:02,368	| IOT193 |	Bluetooth tags for
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:05,952	| IOT193 |	Locating items you put a tag maybe on purse
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:08,256	| IOT193 |	Dora backpack or computer whatever
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:08,768	| IOT193 |	And
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:11,328	| IOT193 |	Ticket believe it behind you can
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:16,704	| IOT193 |	Use crowdsourcing technology from other tracker users to find it but not doing that anymore
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:19,008	| IOT193 |	They're still going to support the old tracker
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:19,776	| IOT193 |	Devices
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:25,408	| IOT193 |	But they have pivoted with a name change they are now called adaro and they have a new line of products
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:26,176	| IOT193 |	Which
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:28,480	| IOT193 |	Is a Twist on what they used to have so
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:33,088	| IOT193 |	I kind of find this interesting what Ed Darrow is going to be selling it back they already are
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,880	| IOT193 |	Are a bunch of
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:36,672	| IOT193 |	Small Bluetooth items
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,208	| IOT193 |	Such as tags
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:38,976	| IOT193 |	Tablets
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:42,560	| IOT193 |	Key Rings lanyards Etc any idea here
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,840	| IOT193 |	Is that you make a smart
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:44,608	| IOT193 |	Container
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:46,144	| IOT193 |	The container might be again
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,424	| IOT193 |	A purse a backpack
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:50,240	| IOT193 |	Duffle bag suitcase whatever might be a briefcase
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:53,312	| IOT193 |	And you basically use the smaller tags
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:54,080	| IOT193 |	Too attached
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,872	| IOT193 |	To all of the items that you normally
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,896	| IOT193 |	Carry in that
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:02,016	| IOT193 |	Smart container that back and when you leave the house if you forgotten one of those items
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,808	| IOT193 |	It will notify you before you leave
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:05,088	| IOT193 |	Right away
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:09,440	| IOT193 |	So I like the idea of this it starts at $119
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:12,000	| IOT193 |	For three tags and three tablets on a charger
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,280	| IOT193 |	So it's not cheap
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:13,792	| IOT193 |	But yeah
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:16,352	| IOT193 |	So I think there's actually
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,120	| IOT193 |	A gem of a
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:17,632	| IOT193 |	Really great
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:21,984	| IOT193 |	And maybe it's because I'm a parent or maybe it's
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,008	| IOT193 |	Because I
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:23,776	| IOT193 |	Personally
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:24,288	| IOT193 |	Have
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,824	| IOT193 |	Crazy lifestyle
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:28,128	| IOT193 |	But if you could bring something like this in
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,408	| IOT193 |	And make it washable
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:31,456	| IOT193 |	And then also make it connect
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,736	| IOT193 |	To your schedule
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:35,296	| IOT193 |	I think you start looking at something that
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:37,088	| IOT193 |	Really change like that would be worth
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:39,648	| IOT193 |	So imagine if
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,416	| IOT193 |	I could put
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,696	| IOT193 |	Like on my daughter's gym clothes
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:42,976	| IOT193 |	These tablets
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,000	| IOT193 |	And I can dissociate that
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:45,536	| IOT193 |	Tuesday
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,048	| IOT193 |	Thursday and Friday
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:48,352	| IOT193 |	Is right
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,632	| IOT193 |	That kind of stuff
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:50,656	| IOT193 |	Do you like kimchi
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:54,240	| IOT193 |	Same thing for me if I could stick it in you know my gym bag
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,032	| IOT193 |	We're pretending I go to work in this scenario
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,056	| IOT193 |	I don't but
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:58,080	| IOT193 |	I could do that in
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:00,384	| IOT193 |	Especially for things that are
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,688	| IOT193 |	Variable is that the way to think about it
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:03,456	| IOT193 |	I don't know
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,224	| IOT193 |	Like I like where the
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:10,624	| IOT193 |	This is going I don't think it's 100% there yet I mean I know people who do forget their sunglasses their keys and their
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,904	| IOT193 |	Smartphone in their wallet
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:13,696	| IOT193 |	Very common
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:21,119	| IOT193 |	Is here but you walk out the door typically with the same X number of items and every once in a while you forget one of those in this week
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:23,423	| IOT193 |	Prevent that they do actually have a way to set up
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,191	| IOT193 |	Customize
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,471	| IOT193 |	Recurring reminders
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:29,311	| IOT193 |	So if you have like an event at 5 that normally go to and bring
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:30,847	| IOT193 |	Certain things you tag them
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:33,663	| IOT193 |	It'll remind you hey your yoga classes coming up
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:36,479	| IOT193 |	Your yoga mat is not in your bag right now don't forget it
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,759	| IOT193 |	Etcetera etcetera so
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,039	| IOT193 |	Ender portal
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,063	| IOT193 |	They're part of the way there
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,623	| IOT193 |	Awesome and this is part of a trend I mean
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:44,159	| IOT193 |	In tracker actually that was
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,927	| IOT193 |	Does your
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:48,511	| IOT193 |	Favorite one out of all the Trap like there's tiles there's a
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,583	| IOT193 |	Oh there's one that starts with a c and I can never remember it
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,375	| IOT193 |	There's a bunch of these out there but you liked
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:54,143	| IOT193 |	The tracker
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,447	| IOT193 |	Yeah we still have them and literally I just
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:01,823	| IOT193 |	Use one right now can I have two more sitting around we have it on the mailbox key
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:06,175	| IOT193 |	Because we have a mailbox down the street or after I go to it soon a townhouse community
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:09,759	| IOT193 |	And whoever gets the mail usually wasn't putting the key back where
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:13,855	| IOT193 |	Didn't we go so nobody could find at the next day so we put that on there so that we could find it
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:15,647	| IOT193 |	And I think
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:17,183	| IOT193 |	Where can I see a lot more of this
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,975	| IOT193 |	Tile even his
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:19,999	| IOT193 |	Diantha sized
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:24,607	| IOT193 |	Individual tiles and is working much more on basically creating a Bluetooth
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,375	| IOT193 |	Tracking Network
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,143	| IOT193 |	Work through
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:28,191	| IOT193 |	Is Partnerships with like Land Rover in
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:30,751	| IOT193 |	Steripen companies and other things
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,263	| IOT193 |	So
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:32,543	| IOT193 |	But I am kind of
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:33,567	| IOT193 |	It makes them
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:38,687	| IOT193 |	It makes sense I mean to smarten up non smart object so that way you know you don't live in behind
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:42,271	| IOT193 |	I like that idea I don't know if I like it enough $420 minimum purchase
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,551	| IOT193 |	Will get there
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,575	| IOT193 |	That's the earliest
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,135	| IOT193 |	We're very familiar with
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:49,951	| IOT193 |	We pay that all the time make it down this case
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,719	| IOT193 |	Spell usually
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:52,255	| IOT193 |	Alright in other news
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,791	| IOT193 |	This is a little bit more
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,071	| IOT193 |	How Deeply Tech
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,607	| IOT193 |	Arm has dropped its
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,887	| IOT193 |	Cordial Bluetooth
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:02,495	| IOT193 |	An arm is the chip design firm it is the brains of almost every
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,031	| IOT193 |	Smartphone out there
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:06,079	| IOT193 |	And has a big iot
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:06,847	| IOT193 |	Division
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:11,199	| IOT193 |	They'd actually created this IP around Bluetooth and narrowband cellular network
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,223	| IOT193 |	Technology
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:15,295	| IOT193 |	To help you it was extra low power it
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,063	| IOT193 |	It was going to be the
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:16,831	| IOT193 |	Special
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,367	| IOT193 |	Highly optimized
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,903	| IOT193 |	Arlo power was very cool
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:21,439	| IOT193 |	They basically a banded it
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,207	| IOT193 |	And
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:24,255	| IOT193 |	My hunch is they abandoned it because
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,023	| IOT193 |	Cuz
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:25,791	| IOT193 |	It was
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:26,815	| IOT193 |	Untested
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,095	| IOT193 |	There's plenty of other
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,119	| IOT193 |	Bluetooth face stuff
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,911	| IOT193 |	Barely low power
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,447	| IOT193 |	And I imagine that
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:34,751	| IOT193 |	The buyers of the stuff for like
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,799	| IOT193 |	Do we want to go with something untested not so much
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,335	| IOT193 |	So
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,359	| IOT193 |	This kind of sad
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:44,479	| IOT193 |	Because I thought it was actually a really interesting technical solution but sometimes really interesting
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,271	| IOT193 |	Tactical Solutions if you don't solve
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:48,319	| IOT193 |	Play huge enough problem in a big enough way
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:48,831	| IOT193 |	It's not worth it
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,623	| IOT193 |	So my hunch is that what
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:57,535	| IOT193 |	It's interesting just run a business perspective they actually made for Acquisitions in the last 3 years to help develop
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,047	| IOT193 |	Concordia prom
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,095	| IOT193 |	Yeah they did
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,631	| IOT193 |	And they had funded some of these
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:02,399	| IOT193 |	Self sow
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,447	| IOT193 |	Philadelphia punch
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,519	| IOT193 |	Sound
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,543	| IOT193 |	All right here is
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,591	| IOT193 |	I guess here's a question
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:13,151	| IOT193 |	Get some feedback from one of our listeners
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,175	| IOT193 |	When we talked about
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,711	| IOT193 |	We answered a question about
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:17,247	| IOT193 |	The guy who has a
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,039	| IOT193 |	His two daughters in their condo
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:20,063	| IOT193 |	What should there
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:22,367	| IOT193 |	Our first home basically have in it from a connector
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:23,903	| IOT193 |	Until are connected devices
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:28,767	| IOT193 |	And somebody was like Stacy and Kevin you guys really missed the mark by Knotts
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,047	| IOT193 |	Suggesting some sort of
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,583	| IOT193 |	Security box
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:32,607	| IOT193 |	So this could be like
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,887	| IOT193 |	Tattoo Joe service maybe it's
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,167	| IOT193 |	Weather Network
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,191	| IOT193 |	For the network
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:40,031	| IOT193 |	And you know we had an Advertiser bitdefender there like I heard about it
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,567	| IOT193 |	Just like the bitdefender Box
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,847	| IOT193 |	It came on right after
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,919	| IOT193 |	I got to think about this and I'm like
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,687	| IOT193 |	I don't
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,711	| IOT193 |	Currently have
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:49,247	| IOT193 |	One of those Services I'll be honest
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,551	| IOT193 |	But I don't actually run one on my
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,855	| IOT193 |	What time and I don't
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,623	| IOT193 |	Feel
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,391	| IOT193 |	Unprotect
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,671	| IOT193 |	But I do feel like
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:58,207	| IOT193 |	There is more information that I
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,231	| IOT193 |	I could know about my network
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,767	| IOT193 |	So I guess you're taking
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:05,631	| IOT193 |	Well I don't have one either right now I have a Google WiFi mesh Network
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:09,471	| IOT193 |	Connected directly to Verizon FiOS which is available in my area so that's
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:10,495	| IOT193 |	Pretty much it
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,007	| IOT193 |	You know it
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:14,847	| IOT193 |	Set up appropriately I don't think there's any more I can do in the Google app
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:18,687	| IOT193 |	To add security I have look at some VPN services
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,991	| IOT193 |	And try them but that causes problems because
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,527	| IOT193 |	We subscribe to
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:24,319	| IOT193 |	Online television and
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,855	| IOT193 |	You start having no
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,391	| IOT193 |	Geolocation issues
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,183	| IOT193 |	When you have a VPN so
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,463	| IOT193 |	I turn VPN off
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:32,767	| IOT193 |	I know there are some boxers that can
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:38,143	| IOT193 |	Not sniff the traffic what sort of monitor the traffic and see if devices are inappropriately
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:42,495	| IOT193 |	Accessing the web and so on and those have to go behind my Wi-Fi
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,263	| IOT193 |	Networking
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:46,079	| IOT193 |	So that seems to be an issue as well cuz
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:52,479	| IOT193 |	I don't want anything behind the network is that causes other set of problems so I think it's a good idea I have yet to have found the right
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,271	| IOT193 |	One for me and
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,807	| IOT193 |	I prefer without a
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:59,903	| IOT193 |	Subscription I'm a look at some that I can install on Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:02,719	| IOT193 |	Pihole that project on fenkell I really block
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,743	| IOT193 |	Herbs and things
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:06,303	| IOT193 |	Give me any security so I'm all for it
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,583	| IOT193 |	I just haven't found the right one
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,351	| IOT193 |	Fair
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:09,887	| IOT193 |	Yeah and so I guess
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:13,215	| IOT193 |	We will amend our answer to say
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:15,007	| IOT193 |	If you're really concerned about this
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:17,311	| IOT193 |	There are security services and box
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,615	| IOT193 |	Does that come I actually do check
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:22,687	| IOT193 |	My Eero Network every now and then to see if any devices are
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,479	| IOT193 |	Like sending more data than they should
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,247	| IOT193 |	But that's about the extent
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,015	| IOT193 |	Extent of it
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,295	| IOT193 |	So I'm not really
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:33,695	| IOT193 |	I do the same in in the Google Wi-Fi app you can see it anytime the history or real-time what devices are on that
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,743	| IOT193 |	Network that IP use the Mac addresses
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:41,119	| IOT193 |	How much traffic they sent over time Etc an indication like if my
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:41,887	| IOT193 |	I don't know if
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,911	| IOT193 |	If your doorbell start
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,447	| IOT193 |	Sending like 30 GB
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,727	| IOT193 |	The traffic a day you're going to be like
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,031	| IOT193 |	Different video
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:54,431	| IOT193 |	Does heat up a bunch of maybe I should look at that closer cuz I typically is one of the higher used devices but like my June oven is using
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,199	| IOT193 |	30 gig
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:55,967	| IOT193 |	Then I'm like
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,015	| IOT193 |	That should not be
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:00,831	| IOT193 |	If your doorbell is using 30 gig I want to know how many
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:02,367	| IOT193 |	Coming up to your door
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:06,719	| IOT193 |	Take Norm for a lot of walks couple times a day in and out in and out
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,743	| IOT193 |	Norm's life is good
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,767	| IOT193 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:11,327	| IOT193 |	So we'll leave it up to you to decide on that way
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,351	| IOT193 |	When I'm not sold
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,887	| IOT193 |	If you are
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:15,679	| IOT193 |	Super concerned or if I noticed
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,215	| IOT193 |	Ad networks slow down
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:17,983	| IOT193 |	I would probably
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:20,031	| IOT193 |	Splurge and get one just to see what's going on
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,079	| IOT193 |	But I'm not sure if it needs
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,359	| IOT193 |	To be there just yet
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:25,663	| IOT193 |	But maybe I'm wrong because according to
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,175	| IOT193 |	Nokia
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,479	| IOT193 |	Excellent Segway
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:31,039	| IOT193 |	According to Nokia iot Bots
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:36,159	| IOT193 |	In 5 minutes now make up 16% of infected devices
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:36,927	| IOT193 |	Observe
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,695	| IOT193 |	On
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:39,487	| IOT193 |	Just general Network
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:39,999	| IOT193 |	In the world
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,791	| IOT193 |	So this is up significantly
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,071	| IOT193 |	According to them from
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,607	| IOT193 |	3.5% of 2
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,399	| IOT193 |	This is there
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,167	| IOT193 |	Malware
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,191	| IOT193 |	Report that they put out the
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:50,239	| IOT193 |	And basically
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,031	| IOT193 |	The big story here is
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,055	| IOT193 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:53,567	| IOT193 |	Iot
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:57,407	| IOT193 |	Art infected iot devices are now huge
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:57,919	| IOT193 |	Horsham
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:01,759	| IOT193 |	Iot bot activity represented
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:03,039	| IOT193 |	At 78%
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,063	| IOT193 |	Networkx
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,623	| IOT193 |	That they have seen in carrier Network
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,159	| IOT193 |	That's more than double the rate
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:11,487	| IOT193 |	In 2016 after the big Turning Point
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,767	| IOT193 |	Mirai
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:13,791	| IOT193 |	So
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:17,887	| IOT193 |	And to put it in perspective for additional perspective Nokia breaks out
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:19,167	| IOT193 |	Different device types
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,959	| IOT193 |	Classes of devices
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,983	| IOT193 |	An Android is
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,799	| IOT193 |	Basically the biggest Target right now they say
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:30,175	| IOT193 |	Leaving notice a Android device is responsible for about 47.15% of observed
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:30,943	| IOT193 |	Maillard effect
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:34,015	| IOT193 |	Windows has 35% so right there you got
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:38,111	| IOT193 |	At seventy 82% of those two device classes IRT and then
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:42,207	| IOT193 |	The iPhone is like less than 1% cyattie basically the other bit here
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:47,839	| IOT193 |	I think that's going to change if you think it was jumping from one year ago to now give it one or two more years
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,607	| IOT193 |	When
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:51,167	| IOT193 |	There are billions more iot devices out there
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:54,751	| IOT193 |	And what do the bats go after the Big Easy targets
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,287	| IOT193 |	And that's what iot is becoming
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:12:02,687	| IOT193 |	Well I think it's worth noting that these iot devices are basically anything that's not a smartphone or
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:04,735	| IOT193 |	Computer and one of the challenges
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:05,759	| IOT193 |	Is there is
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:08,319	| IOT193 |	There a lot of iot devices out there that
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,855	| IOT193 |	We don't necessarily think of as I am
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,391	| IOT193 |	They might be
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,159	| IOT193 |	Printers
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,951	| IOT193 |	Or networked DVRs
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:16,511	| IOT193 |	So while this is a real
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,023	| IOT193 |	Rhett
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:22,911	| IOT193 |	Probably less of a threat for something like your thermostat one because it doesn't have a lot of processing power
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:26,239	| IOT193 |	Into because I'm good company is going to
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:30,079	| IOT193 |	Handle things like API limit calls so it's not going to reach out
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,591	| IOT193 |	Try to talk to
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:31,615	| IOT193 |	To offer
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,407	| IOT193 |	So that's just something
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,175	| IOT193 |	Nothing about if
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:36,223	| IOT193 |	You're going to pick a device that scary
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:40,319	| IOT193 |	I would look to video doorbells video cameras that are connected
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:42,879	| IOT193 |	And I would really make sure when you're buying those devices
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,415	| IOT193 |	Buy them from reputa
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,463	| IOT193 |	All right
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,767	| IOT193 |	As many of you guys know I'm planning on moving
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:52,351	| IOT193 |	And well it's still like 6 months away but you know it
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,143	| IOT193 |	I'm still thinking about all of my devices
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:57,727	| IOT193 |	And you can expect to hear more about this but I love the fact
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,007	| IOT193 |	Property Brothers
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:00,543	| IOT193 |	Those guys on
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:02,591	| IOT193 |	I don't know is it Bravo what channel is
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:03,615	| IOT193 |	What channel are they on
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,407	| IOT193 |	HGTV
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:05,919	| IOT193 |	Oh
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,199	| IOT193 |	Yeah that makes
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:08,991	| IOT193 |	So those guys
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:12,319	| IOT193 |	They actually did a panel where they talked about Smart Homes and
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,343	| IOT193 |	Selling your smartphone
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,879	| IOT193 |	I'm so of course I read it
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,927	| IOT193 |	And didn't tell me anything new
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,695	| IOT193 |	But
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,975	| IOT193 |	They did say that
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:20,767	| IOT193 |	Look when you have all the
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:22,559	| IOT193 |	Play smart devices they become
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:23,327	| IOT193 |	A feature
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:26,399	| IOT193 |	If possible selling point your home so don't take them out leave them in there
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:28,447	| IOT193 |	So things like your nest thermostat
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:31,263	| IOT193 |	Or your video doorbells or even light switches
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,543	| IOT193 |	He says they can
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:34,079	| IOT193 |	Raise your home's value
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,615	| IOT193 |	Yeah I could see that man
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,919	| IOT193 |	It is an investment as they say number one in
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:42,015	| IOT193 |	It's a value to the new buyers potential I mean not everybody wants a smart home but
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,551	| IOT193 |	Becoming very prevalent
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:47,391	| IOT193 |	The thing is little and I kind of realized this when I moved 2 years ago
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:49,183	| IOT193 |	If you're going to leave everything
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:54,559	| IOT193 |	You still have to actually factory reset everything and leave instructions for people have said all this
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,071	| IOT193 |	Stuff up
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,863	| IOT193 |	That was going to be my play
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:59,167	| IOT193 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:00,191	| IOT193 |	I'm in the process
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:02,495	| IOT193 |	Figuring out what I will leave
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:04,287	| IOT193 |	And I realized that some of my device
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,823	| IOT193 |	Is our Echo only
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:09,663	| IOT193 |	For example and so nice person comes in with a Google they're going to be like
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,199	| IOT193 |	I don't need this
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:12,223	| IOT193 |	Which is fine
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:12,991	| IOT193 |	They don't have to have it
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:16,575	| IOT193 |	Are they don't have to use it but like my echo powered faucet
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,111	| IOT193 |	And the other thing is
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,391	| IOT193 |	When you're showing off
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:19,903	| IOT193 |	Off the house
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,951	| IOT193 |	And you mention these things
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:22,719	| IOT193 |	The stuff better work
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:25,535	| IOT193 |	In I don't know about you but sometimes I will
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,303	| IOT193 |	Hotel
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:29,375	| IOT193 |	Padme to do something you were even Google to do something
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,143	| IOT193 |	And
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:30,655	| IOT193 |	Nothing happens
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:32,191	| IOT193 |	Maybe they didn't hear me
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:33,983	| IOT193 |	Right or my favorite is like
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:34,751	| IOT193 |	Wind
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,775	| IOT193 |	I say something in
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:38,591	| IOT193 |	Madam a thinks I said something else and provides me with
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:39,359	| IOT193 |	Completely different answer
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:43,199	| IOT193 |	It does but if you're trying to sell someone on the
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,991	| IOT193 |	Mustafa it's a little less ideal
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,271	| IOT193 |	Agreed

EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,903	| IOT193 |	Supported except
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:06,719	| IOT193 |	For the idevices thermostat and there
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:08,511	| IOT193 |	Customizable LED night light
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:12,863	| IOT193 |	Other than that any connected smart home idevice product you can

EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,935	| IOT193 |	Another i-news iHome has launched
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:19,007	| IOT193 |	Vanity mirror and alarm clock
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,287	| IOT193 |	I
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:23,615	| IOT193 |	Yeah let's just go with music and movement
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:30,271	| IOT193 |	I know Evans gets into what I said A week or two ago and I was saying it's just at some point it's going to
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:36,671	| IOT193 |	Stop making sense of microphones and speakers and every single thing like I don't see why you need it in a vanity mirror quite honestly
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:38,719	| IOT193 |	This is why I want to know this my little robot
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:41,023	| IOT193 |	Follow me around or whatever listen

EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:51,007	| IOT193 |	Yeah well for $180 I will not do that for this spending year
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,287	| IOT193 |	That's how much it is
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:52,799	| IOT193 |	That is how much
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:54,335	| IOT193 |	Also
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,871	| IOT193 |	Other crazy new products
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:56,639	| IOT193 |	Bose
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,943	| IOT193 |	Has created gosh it's another glasses out the
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:02,015	| IOT193 |	It is a new wearable it is
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:02,783	| IOT193 |	These are sunglasses
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,831	| IOT193 |	And I don't even know
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:09,183	| IOT193 |	What's it look like normal sunglass actually look like snaps
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:10,207	| IOT193 |	Spectacles
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:12,255	| IOT193 |	With just a sunglass of the minutes
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:14,559	| IOT193 |	They're $199 you can pre-order them
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:17,375	| IOT193 |	There's some AR apps actually coming next year so they're not just
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,167	| IOT193 |	Smart glasses
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,959	| IOT193 |	Speakers
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:23,007	| IOT193 |	Yep there speakers
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:25,567	| IOT193 |	Is there microphones
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:26,847	| IOT193 |	AR
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:29,919	| IOT193 |	And yeah and you can access your virtual assistant
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:33,247	| IOT193 |	I mean it's kind of like her except it's sunglasses not that your thing
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,551	| IOT193 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:39,903	| IOT193 |	I don't have the nice thing is you won't hear or people around you won't hear the assistant
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:42,207	| IOT193 |	Through the speakers because they're kind of
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:45,791	| IOT193 |	Patched into the arm of the glasses or no earbuds or anything
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:48,863	| IOT193 |	So I don't think of using like bone-conduction Witchwood
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:51,167	| IOT193 |	Give me a little more privacy as well but they say that
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,191	| IOT193 |	It's pretty discreet
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,727	| IOT193 |	And they will run up to
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:55,007	| IOT193 |	3.5 hours
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:55,775	| IOT193 |	4
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:57,311	| IOT193 |	Playback of music
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,335	| IOT193 |	And 12 hours on Steam
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:01,407	| IOT193 |	So you don't end up considering their sunglasses
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,431	| IOT193 |	I think it's a little weird
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:03,711	| IOT193 |	Just because
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:04,991	| IOT193 |	I mean like
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,015	| IOT193 |	You're inside
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:07,551	| IOT193 |	I don't know I mean I get it
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,087	| IOT193 |	You're outside you're away from
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:10,367	| IOT193 |	I'm stuffed but are you even connect
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:17,535	| IOT193 |	You probably going to Bluetooth to the phone because there's no assistant built-in so to speak it's going to leverage in assistant on your
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:22,655	| IOT193 |	Your phone so I'm very can I have prescription sunglasses so I'm not the market
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:25,215	| IOT193 |	Get there going to be $200 pre-order start today
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:26,495	| IOT193 |	They're not going to be out for a while
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,799	| IOT193 |	Let us know if you buy this I'm really intrigued
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:31,359	| IOT193 |	I think it's neat and I'm like oh I can't wait
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:33,407	| IOT193 |	So they work as a Bluetooth
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:34,943	| IOT193 |	Headset for phone calls as well
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:37,247	| IOT193 |	You can take calls make calls I mean I don't
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:40,575	| IOT193 |	I'm not in the market for this and I think we've kind of
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:43,391	| IOT193 |	A kind of gotten over the whole smartglasses thing
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,671	| IOT193 |	But maybe
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:45,695	| IOT193 |	Sure I mean
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,231	| IOT193 |	Let's give it a throw it out there soon
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:48,767	| IOT193 |	Ikea
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:50,559	| IOT193 |	Has announced a in addition to its
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,071	| IOT193 |	Triad
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,887	| IOT193 |	Line of products
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:55,679	| IOT193 |	It is a $10 smart plug
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,447	| IOT193 |	To go with it
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,215	| IOT193 |	Lights
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:58,239	| IOT193 |	There's nothing much
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,007	| IOT193 |	To say about that
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:00,287	| IOT193 |	Arlo has
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:00,799	| IOT193 |	Updated
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:05,151	| IOT193 |	Wireless security camera now it has the Arlo Ultra
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:08,991	| IOT193 |	It is a 4K HDR wireless security camera it has a built
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:09,759	| IOT193 |	10 spotlight
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:10,783	| IOT193 |	And
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,319	| IOT193 |	It's $400
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:16,416	| IOT193 |	Well 4K doesn't come cheap got to pay for all those case
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:16,928	| IOT193 |	I just
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:22,048	| IOT193 |	I don't know if we'll get there with 4k on all these devices over time in the prices will come down
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:25,888	| IOT193 |	So somebody had to be out of the gate cuz I don't think any other security cameras right now
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,656	| IOT193 |	R4k
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:27,936	| IOT193 |	Do you need that
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:30,240	| IOT193 |	Definition will
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:36,640	| IOT193 |	Are you know if you have cameras outside for example maybe something happen to your car like mine did with the nest cam
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:40,480	| IOT193 |	I could tell that a car hit it I could see my car move when it got hit
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:46,880	| IOT193 |	It was hard for me to exactly determine the type of vehicle and I certainly can see their license plate because zooming in
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:49,440	| IOT193 |	A 1080p didn't cut it so
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:51,488	| IOT193 |	If you can get four times the pixels
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:54,560	| IOT193 |	Then maybe there are use cases where yeah zooming is going to be useful
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:58,144	| IOT193 |	I'm not saying it's worth it I'm just saying
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:58,912	| IOT193 |	Hey
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,448	| IOT193 |	Speaking of nest
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:07,360	| IOT193 |	Did your camera go down again I did not get any notifications that my Nest cameras went down but apparently a bunch of
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:08,128	| IOT193 |	People did
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:09,152	| IOT193 |	Last week
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:10,432	| IOT193 |	I think it was
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:14,272	| IOT193 |	The overseer was just a couple days ago my bad on December 3rd
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:21,184	| IOT193 |	Nest went down again Booth third time in less than a month this happened on the 15th of November 27th of November
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:26,304	| IOT193 |	And on December 3rd and no root cause has been identified but it has been
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:26,816	| IOT193 |	Obviously
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:28,864	| IOT193 |	Where everybody would know about it
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:29,888	| IOT193 |	What's going on
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:32,960	| IOT193 |	With a cloud services on Google Cloud
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:33,472	| IOT193 |	I don't know
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,520	| IOT193 |	But if anyone has any clues
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:36,288	| IOT193 |	Let us know
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:40,128	| IOT193 |	In the meantime I do appreciate that whatever my Nest devices go offline or have trouble
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:42,176	| IOT193 |	I do actually get an email notice
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,456	| IOT193 |	Application that's like by the way
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,992	| IOT193 |	We're not working
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,016	| IOT193 |	So you know that's
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,808	| IOT193 |	Kind of a bare minimum but it is nice
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:48,832	| IOT193 |	Not all of my device
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:49,344	| IOT193 |	Isis do that
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:55,488	| IOT193 |	And actually I should give a shout out to downdetector.com because that is at one place too
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:59,072	| IOT193 |	Search for any services that are disruptive and actually right now
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:01,632	| IOT193 |	On the east and west coast sewer are some
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,912	| IOT193 |	Issues with nest
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,680	| IOT193 |	I don't think it's
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,448	| IOT193 |	Ton
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:07,008	| IOT193 |	But I see the map and it's got some yellow and orange
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,032	| IOT193 |	Dots on it
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:08,544	| IOT193 |	No
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:11,872	| IOT193 |	Let's see we have
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:12,640	| IOT193 |	Are lenovo's
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,176	| IOT193 |	We have to
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:15,712	| IOT193 |	Each of us has a Lenovo smart.
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,224	| IOT193 |	Play whe
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,016	| IOT193 |	They have new features
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,832	| IOT193 |	Too and I do
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:24,416	| IOT193 |	New features in fact they are getting cooking features
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,184	| IOT193 |	Such as
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:29,024	| IOT193 |	Your cookbook and how save and retrieve recipes you can make save
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:32,096	| IOT193 |	Certain recipes maybe that you use on a regular basis
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:35,424	| IOT193 |	They have the nest hello doorbell two-way talk
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:36,192	| IOT193 |	Which
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,216	| IOT193 |	I have on my
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:41,312	| IOT193 |	Pixel 3 phone so that way it just pops right up the doorbell shows music
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:45,152	| IOT193 |	All the way downstairs and my display is Right neck
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:52,064	| IOT193 |	So that's going to be and when I tested this on the pixel it was so much faster than having to open the app after getting a note
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:56,160	| IOT193 |	Vacation and by the time I did that to talk to whoever was on the front porch they already gone
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:59,488	| IOT193 |	So this is a much better way to do it they have touch alarms in the
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:05,632	| IOT193 |	Quick Settings now the time out to go to a dark screen is actually faster when in low light which is good at night time
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:12,544	| IOT193 |	You can even Now by voice I turn off the screen I don't do that so if these sensor isn't quite working at night to your side of
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,568	| IOT193 |	Faction you can say hey
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,336	| IOT193 |	Java spring
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,104	| IOT193 |	And then
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:20,736	| IOT193 |	I really like respect my white loves us the bigger dark screen clock face have you looked at this lately
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:23,040	| IOT193 |	Yes I noticed that and I was like
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:26,624	| IOT193 |	You have the update and me with
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:28,160	| IOT193 |	Terrible eyesight
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:33,024	| IOT193 |	Even with the smart display on my nightstand right next to my bed I could not read the little clock
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:34,560	| IOT193 |	At night so now I can
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:36,352	| IOT193 |	Well I must read this one my eyes are really bad

EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:39,936	| IOT193 |	Suppose sunglass
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:41,216	| IOT193 |	Then you can have an AR
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:43,520	| IOT193 |	Who needs good vision
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:44,288	| IOT193 |	Just use AR
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:47,616	| IOT193 |	Let's talk about your new toy you got a Google home hub
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,152	| IOT193 |	Yes yeah
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:55,552	| IOT193 |	Speaking of smart displays at the last second while the Google home hub was on sale for $99 direct from Google
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,320	| IOT193 |	I ordered one
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:25:00,672	| IOT193 |	It is so small which I knew because I saw it at the laundromat but I
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:05,280	| IOT193 |	Took it out of the box as soon as it arrives and I send Stacy a picture of this device in the palm of my hand
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,816	| IOT193 |	And what did you think when you saw that
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,400	| IOT193 |	Cute butt
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:13,472	| IOT193 |	Again with bad eyes I like a larger display on things
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:19,872	| IOT193 |	So we actually because we have a 10 inch smart display in the bedroom I stopped watching TV on that
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:23,456	| IOT193 |	Facts about TV on the wall there I was using it for you to TV from time to time
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:25,504	| IOT193 |	But it's big on a nightstand so we
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:28,320	| IOT193 |	Suave I bought the home hub for the kitchen island
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:30,624	| IOT193 |	To watch news in the morning or coffee with my wife
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:35,744	| IOT193 |	But actually the smart display is better the big one the 10-inch one so now the Google home hub is on the nightstand
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:40,096	| IOT193 |	An array it's a good fit there I think that's an ideal size for the bed
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:44,448	| IOT193 |	It does all the same things as well whenever one I just does not have a camera that's fine
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,984	| IOT193 |	But Duo calls actually work
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:51,616	| IOT193 |	The same I mean I didn't know my son was going to call you about having to be laying around in bed and I got to do a call on me
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:58,016	| IOT193 |	I'm up if you can only do Audiomack I don't care and pick it up so I pick it up I explain to him that I got no camera here he said that's no problem
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:59,552	| IOT193 |	He was happy to show me his
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:05,952	| IOT193 |	Happy face so we had a great call the experience was fine yeah I mean I think it's a nice device at specially 99
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:07,488	| IOT193 |	149 it's a little pricey
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:09,280	| IOT193 |	All right and I think
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,048	| IOT193 |	It's a good bedside tables
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:13,120	| IOT193 |	I also have a
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:16,192	| IOT193 |	Talk about I have a review unit of the
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:17,728	| IOT193 |	First Alert onelink
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,008	| IOT193 |	Safe and
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:19,776	| IOT193 |	Sound
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,824	| IOT193 |	That is a mouthful it's actually device
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:23,872	| IOT193 |	We recommended on her gift guide
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:24,640	| IOT193 |	4
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:25,408	| IOT193 |	Play parents
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:25,920	| IOT193 |	Just because
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,992	| IOT193 |	So it is expensive it's about $200
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:31,040	| IOT193 |	But this is a smoke detector
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:32,832	| IOT193 |	A carbon monoxide detector
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,112	| IOT193 |	And
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:35,648	| IOT193 |	The crazy part
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:37,440	| IOT193 |	It's a really good speaker
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,208	| IOT193 |	Bitconnect
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:39,744	| IOT193 |	To Apple homekit
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,512	| IOT193 |	And
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:42,048	| IOT193 |	Amazon's Echo
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:42,560	| IOT193 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:44,352	| IOT193 |	So I can
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:45,120	| IOT193 |	Talk to this
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:49,472	| IOT193 |	Speaker and I tell it to do something I can talk to it just like I would talk to Madam a
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:53,312	| IOT193 |	Controls all those devices it also will play my music
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:54,080	| IOT193 |	From anime
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:56,384	| IOT193 |	And it will also make phone
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:59,200	| IOT193 |	So and it sounds amazing
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:00,992	| IOT193 |	The only issue I have
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:03,808	| IOT193 |	With it is because my smoke detectors and I think most smoke
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,344	| IOT193 |	Actors are set by the doorways of rooms
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:06,880	| IOT193 |	I kind of want this thing in the
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,392	| IOT193 |	The center of my
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:09,696	| IOT193 |	Has one big
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:14,560	| IOT193 |	It also has a night light that is a multi colored LED that you can
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,840	| IOT193 |	Can set so I can set it
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,864	| IOT193 |	I think right now it's set to
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:19,680	| IOT193 |	So you know in the middle of the night or whatever it is
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,704	| IOT193 |	Detects a lowlights
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,728	| IOT193 |	Setting it's like
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,264	| IOT193 |	What turn the night light on
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:26,336	| IOT193 |	Socket has purple glowy light in my hall right now where I'm testing it out
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,360	| IOT193 |	Setting it up with
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:28,896	| IOT193 |	Super Breeze
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:29,664	| IOT193 |	I have
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,432	| IOT193 |	Kidde smoke
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,200	| IOT193 |	Detectors
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:31,968	| IOT193 |	So
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:32,480	| IOT193 |	It's a different brand
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:35,296	| IOT193 |	They have a comes with three different connectors
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,064	| IOT193 |	And a mounting bracket
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,624	| IOT193 |	So I unscrewed my mounting bracket
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:39,392	| IOT193 |	I took Olive like
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:41,184	| IOT193 |	30 seconds
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:42,464	| IOT193 |	Pop the other mounting bracket
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:45,536	| IOT193 |	And use the little connector shove the wires up
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:48,096	| IOT193 |	Screw the sucker on the hardest part
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:49,376	| IOT193 |	Was actually screwing it
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:50,144	| IOT193 |	Into
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:51,168	| IOT193 |	Mounting bracket
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:53,216	| IOT193 |	Not a hundred percent sure I
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:54,496	| IOT193 |	Got all of the things
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,080	| IOT193 |	I say this be
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:00,128	| IOT193 |	Because this is a very heavy
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:01,664	| IOT193 |	Smoke alarm it weighs like
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,456	| IOT193 |	I don't know pound and a half to pounds
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:05,504	| IOT193 |	It's not something like
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:06,784	| IOT193 |	Cuz like I really don't want to
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:08,320	| IOT193 |	First of all because it is heavy
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,088	| IOT193 |	It's a decent speaker
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:10,624	| IOT193 |	Indecent speakers
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:13,184	| IOT193 |	Are heavy weighs 1.76 lb
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:14,464	| IOT193 |	Oh I was good but
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,232	| IOT193 |	Check Outback
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,256	| IOT193 |	Yes that was a good guess
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:18,304	| IOT193 |	And it does have like I said
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:22,656	| IOT193 |	The homekit compatibility sew-in is going to have AirPlay 2 coming later on
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:24,192	| IOT193 |	So you can actually
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,728	| IOT193 |	Play your Apple music
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:27,264	| IOT193 |	Through it if you set it up as
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:28,544	| IOT193 |	Homekit function
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:29,824	| IOT193 |	Functionality
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,128	| IOT193 |	I didn't do that because
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:35,456	| IOT193 |	Didn't need to but you know if you wanted to
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:37,504	| IOT193 |	You could actually set it up as a homekit devices
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:38,016	| IOT193 |	Control it from there
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:40,064	| IOT193 |	I tested it it works
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:44,160	| IOT193 |	As a traditional smoke alarm so it will go off
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:46,976	| IOT193 |	And will also set off all of your other smoke alarms
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:47,488	| IOT193 |	If they're inert
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:51,840	| IOT193 |	Does it send you an alert on your
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:53,120	| IOT193 |	On your body

EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:30,304	| IOT193 |	As always that they are not located at
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:31,072	| IOT193 |	Outside of the US
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:32,352	| IOT193 |	Or
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:33,120	| IOT193 |	Canada

EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:41,568	| IOT193 |	It is David and based on his area code I suspect he is within the US
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:45,920	| IOT193 |	He actually left us a good question in November that we didn't get to he's looking for a Smart Switch
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:50,272	| IOT193 |	I work shop light but he has to fluorescence and no neutral wire and
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:52,320	| IOT193 |	We looked and we didn't find anything
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,856	| IOT193 |	There was a product that you sweet made
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:54,880	| IOT193 |	That would work for that
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:55,392	| IOT193 |	But
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:57,184	| IOT193 |	We came up empty so
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:32:01,024	| IOT193 |	At least you're not empty-headed David you you win the Schlage Smart Lock
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:02,560	| IOT193 |	Yay
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,096	| IOT193 |	All right and I should note that last week
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:05,888	| IOT193 |	We talked about
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,168	| IOT193 |	Putting in a smart
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:09,472	| IOT193 |	Light switch without a neutral wire I said that
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:12,288	| IOT193 |	The only option out there was Lutron
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:14,336	| IOT193 |	And a bunch of people who use insteon
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,616	| IOT193 |	We're like jalapeno
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:16,640	| IOT193 |	That is not true
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:19,712	| IOT193 |	Is insteon actually makes a light switch that also works
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:21,248	| IOT193 |	Out
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,528	| IOT193 |	A neutral wire
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:23,552	| IOT193 |	You will need
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:24,064	| IOT193 |	In NC
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:27,136	| IOT193 |	However you also need a Lutron Hub so you know
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:29,696	| IOT193 |	Similar
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:30,720	| IOT193 |	And now
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:32,000	| IOT193 |	Let's go to this week
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:32,768	| IOT193 |	Question
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:33,536	| IOT193 |	Which is from
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,048	| IOT193 |	Clarissa
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,096	| IOT193 |	Hi guys this is
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:38,400	| IOT193 |	I have
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:40,192	| IOT193 |	Question about
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:42,240	| IOT193 |	Smart Talk
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:43,776	| IOT193 |	If you guys
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:45,568	| IOT193 |	We're not concerned about privacy and anyway
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:50,176	| IOT193 |	My tech would you be using in your bed
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:51,712	| IOT193 |	Thanks have a great one
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:53,504	| IOT193 |	Okay Clarissa
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:55,552	| IOT193 |	This is a good question
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:57,088	| IOT193 |	And when we can totally help with
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:57,856	| IOT193 |	So
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:32:58,368	| IOT193 |	Clarissa
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:32:59,648	| IOT193 |	Let us explain it
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:07,328	| IOT193 |	We actually probably have more devices to suggest than one would want in their bedroom and working
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:09,888	| IOT193 |	Keeping in mind that maybe privacy doesn't matter enough
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:11,680	| IOT193 |	That's fine that's a personal choice
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:13,472	| IOT193 |	Some useful items we have in here
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:16,544	| IOT193 |	So we mentioned the smartest plays earlier in the show
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:18,592	| IOT193 |	I definitely think that's a good
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:21,664	| IOT193 |	Place for a smart displays in the bedroom is Stacy and said
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:25,760	| IOT193 |	Because you have voice control of all of your smart home devices you can also
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:28,064	| IOT193 |	Touch screen control them if maybe
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:30,112	| IOT193 |	Somebody sleeping in the room you don't want to use a voice
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:31,904	| IOT193 |	You can get weather information York
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:32,928	| IOT193 |	Calendar
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:33,952	| IOT193 |	You can do
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:36,000	| IOT193 |	Cameras from other devices in your home
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:36,512	| IOT193 |	Really handy
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:40,352	| IOT193 |	You probably want some smart followers and or switches
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:41,376	| IOT193 |	We could
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:44,192	| IOT193 |	Decide on any single one there's so many options out there
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:45,984	| IOT193 |	So did want to make a plug
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:46,752	| IOT193 |	4
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:51,872	| IOT193 |	There a couple lights like Philips and GE make lights that are designed for better
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:54,432	| IOT193 |	Sleeping better
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:55,456	| IOT193 |	Throughout circadian rhythm
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:59,296	| IOT193 |	Circuit anyway
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,600	| IOT193 |	Start out with bright daylight
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:05,440	| IOT193 |	And then evolve slowly into a deeper orange as it gets towards sleepy
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:09,280	| IOT193 |	And when you wake up you can have those kind of come up like Sunrise which
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:10,304	| IOT193 |	Kind of nice
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:12,352	| IOT193 |	And then we also have
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:15,680	| IOT193 |	Amazon look with Stacy you
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,216	| IOT193 |	This is
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:20,800	| IOT193 |	Kind of interesting because you can use it to help get
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:21,824	| IOT193 |	Clothes selection
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:26,432	| IOT193 |	Yes it is a camera where you basically put on an outfit
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:27,200	| IOT193 |	Take a picture
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:28,480	| IOT193 |	Using the web camera
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:29,760	| IOT193 |	Snap a picture
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:30,784	| IOT193 |	And it snaps a picture
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:32,064	| IOT193 |	And then you
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:32,576	| IOT193 |	Put on
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:34,368	| IOT193 |	Other outfit options
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:38,208	| IOT193 |	What's it basically looks at those and says
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:38,976	| IOT193 |	This one's better
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:40,256	| IOT193 |	So
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:43,584	| IOT193 |	This is a really kind of silly thing but I threw it in there just in case
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:44,352	| IOT193 |	You
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:45,632	| IOT193 |	Have doubts about your
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:47,168	| IOT193 |	Watch over need a friend
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:54,080	| IOT193 |	If my wife ever divorce has met with her fashion degree and go somewhere else I will get one of those because
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:55,360	| IOT193 |	She dresses me basically
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:56,640	| IOT193 |	Photo app that doesn't happen
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:34:57,920	| IOT193 |	Let's hope
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:04,320	| IOT193 |	I'm always thinking ahead I want to be prepared you know you know
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:10,720	| IOT193 |	If you want to monitor your sleep you could obviously do that through wearable devices there's so many of those that do track
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:13,024	| IOT193 |	Sleep such as the fitbits and smart watches and such
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:15,328	| IOT193 |	Why things actually makes
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:16,096	| IOT193 |	A nice
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:17,888	| IOT193 |	Relatively inexpensive
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:19,168	| IOT193 |	Solution for this
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:23,008	| IOT193 |	You basically put a little pad under your mattress and it
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:25,312	| IOT193 |	Tracks your sleep sleep stages heart rate
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,848	| IOT193 |	Snoring the whole shebang
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:29,152	| IOT193 |	And you can get that for about
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:35,552	| IOT193 |	$80 on sale list price as a hundred bucks which is not too expensive as a nice smartphone app as well so you can look at the graphs
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:36,320	| IOT193 |	Send all the data
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:40,160	| IOT193 |	If that's your thing and then we also came up with
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:41,952	| IOT193 |	Monitoring your air
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:42,976	| IOT193 |	In your bedroom
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:48,608	| IOT193 |	Because you want to be sleeping in clean air if they see you mentioned this before because you bought one
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:49,632	| IOT193 |	To monitor the
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:50,656	| IOT193 |	Classroom are
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:52,192	| IOT193 |	For your daughter's class
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:57,312	| IOT193 |	And it's the aware glow which is kind of like a smart plug but also with sensors to monitor
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:59,104	| IOT193 |	Different aspects of the air quality
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:00,128	| IOT193 |	Yes it
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,944	| IOT193 |	Temperature humidity
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,712	| IOT193 |	The
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:04,736	| IOT193 |	Carbon dioxide
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:06,528	| IOT193 |	Oxide in the air and also
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:07,040	| IOT193 |	Quote on quote
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:08,320	| IOT193 |	Chemicals
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:09,088	| IOT193 |	Which are
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:09,600	| IOT193 |	Volatile or
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:15,744	| IOT193 |	And I didn't know until you mentioned it before the show that
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:17,280	| IOT193 |	You can actually use that
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:18,048	| IOT193 |	Data
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:22,656	| IOT193 |	And have the arrears plug actually turn on say humidifier this Plug-In or a
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:25,216	| IOT193 |	Air purifier or a heater or air conditioner
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:30,080	| IOT193 |	Yes you will tell be aware what you plugged into it basically
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:32,640	| IOT193 |	So if he's plug-in in our case we plug it in
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:33,152	| IOT193 |	Air purifier
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,944	| IOT193 |	When it sees
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:38,528	| IOT193 |	That the air quality is degrading it will actually
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:39,808	| IOT193 |	Proactively turn on the air
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:41,344	| IOT193 |	Which is
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:43,136	| IOT193 |	Cool feature I think
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:48,768	| IOT193 |	So you just tell it what your plug again and then I will use it to proactively adapt Fiero
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:49,536	| IOT193 |	Around you
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:50,560	| IOT193 |	And I think that's
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:51,072	| IOT193 |	Awesome picture
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:57,728	| IOT193 |	And since we have an air purifier that nobody wants to get out of bed to flip the switch I am going to go by myself in a where
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:58,496	| IOT193 |	Glow because
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:00,288	| IOT193 |	That is perfect for what we need
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:06,688	| IOT193 |	Last thing we could suggest that this is really going to town if you don't care about privacy we talked about it before the 1400
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:08,736	| IOT193 |	Dollar 3D body
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:11,040	| IOT193 |	Scanner mirror from naked Labs yes
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:15,392	| IOT193 |	The naked so you could see how fit you are or not
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:18,208	| IOT193 |	Well I didn't want to say that but yes
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:19,232	| IOT193 |	Yes because
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:23,584	| IOT193 |	Gretchen you probably wouldn't have that in your bedroom that might be in a bathroom connected to the bedroom but
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:26,144	| IOT193 |	I think it's really interesting product I just don't think it's
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:28,448	| IOT193 |	First $1,400 when I can
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:31,776	| IOT193 |	You take pictures or have my family just told me I'm getting fat but that's just me
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:32,288	| IOT193 |	I think it's
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:33,312	| IOT193 |	Venus Project
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:35,616	| IOT193 |	And I would not want it at all in my life
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:38,432	| IOT193 |	I don't even like that it exists in the world but
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:41,504	| IOT193 |	Close because of privacy or because you have
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:43,552	| IOT193 |	Because I don't want to know
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:45,600	| IOT193 |	Okay
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:46,880	| IOT193 |	I can do something else
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:47,904	| IOT193 |	Without the aid
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:49,440	| IOT193 |	An artificial
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:54,304	| IOT193 |	You can pay me $10 a week
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:56,096	| IOT193 |	For you as well.
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:58,144	| IOT193 |	Cuz I like you I think you're my friend
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:02,752	| IOT193 |	So I am biased yes I would not want that information from you cuz at the end of it I be like
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:04,288	| IOT193 |	Screw you Kevin
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:05,568	| IOT193 |	So much for that Revenue stream
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:07,616	| IOT193 |	All right
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:12,224	| IOT193 |	So hopefully out of all of these devices oh and I will throw this in
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:14,528	| IOT193 |	We talked about having a connected bedside table lamp
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:17,856	| IOT193 |	Which I think is great but also why not connect your bedroom light switch
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,648	| IOT193 |	Because then if
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:20,416	| IOT193 |	Those lights have
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:21,184	| IOT193 |	And Beyond
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:24,256	| IOT193 |	You can turn them off with your voice without getting out of bed witch
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:26,816	| IOT193 |	What time snug under my covers I do not
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:28,096	| IOT193 |	Want to leave that room so
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:30,144	| IOT193 |	I would throw that in there and maybe a smart outlet
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:33,216	| IOT193 |	Letter to to control fans or anything else you got going on
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:33,728	| IOT193 |	In the bedroom
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:35,520	| IOT193 |	So all of those
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:37,056	| IOT193 |	Really
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:37,824	| IOT193 |	Actually have most of
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:42,688	| IOT193 |	And I thought you cared about privacy and I do care about
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:48,832	| IOT193 |	Privacy I don't have any cameras in the bedroom that's the only thing I don't have the look is in my closet facing away unless I need
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:50,880	| IOT193 |	Facebook portal
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,160	| IOT193 |	Nope
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:52,928	| IOT193 |	All right
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:53,696	| IOT193 |	Well
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:58,304	| IOT193 |	That is it for this segment of the show please stay tuned for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:00,608	| IOT193 |	And our interview with
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:01,888	| IOT193 |	Cit
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:03,680	| IOT193 |	CEO of the City of Calgary
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:06,240	| IOT193 |	Talking about their laurel-ann
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,008	| IOT193 |	Sensor Network
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:14,432	| IOT193 |	Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor sponsor is
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:18,784	| IOT193 |	Digicert and I have Mike Nelson who is VP of iot security
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:19,296	| IOT193 |	Here to talk to
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:23,136	| IOT193 |	Let's get this started by telling us a little bit about what digicert
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:26,208	| IOT193 |	Where certificate Authority or the largest certificate
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:28,768	| IOT193 |	30 globally in our services are
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:30,048	| IOT193 |	Protecting internet connection
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:32,864	| IOT193 |	And that raises everything from SSL TLS
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:36,960	| IOT193 |	Certificate for website security to Enterprise Security Solutions and
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:37,728	| IOT193 |	My area ZIP code
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:39,776	| IOT193 |	Courses with iot
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:42,848	| IOT193 |	Security and we have robust Solutions using visual search
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:44,640	| IOT193 |	Give the kids to secure it authentication
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:46,432	| IOT193 |	Communication over the internet
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:47,968	| IOT193 |	Excellent all right
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:50,272	| IOT193 |	Well you guys recently did a survey
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:51,040	| IOT193 |	About coyotes
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:52,576	| IOT193 |	What did you guys discuss
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:55,392	| IOT193 |	Yeah earlier this year was selected
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:59,744	| IOT193 |	A survey we reached out to over 700 engineer's for iot
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:00,768	| IOT193 |	Manufacturers
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:03,584	| IOT193 |	These were people on the front lines
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:04,608	| IOT193 |	Security in their organization
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:06,400	| IOT193 |	Other respondents
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,680	| IOT193 |	Divided them into
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:08,192	| IOT193 |	Three tier
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:09,728	| IOT193 |	The top tier
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:11,520	| IOT193 |	Would be classified as organizations
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:13,312	| IOT193 |	Sunset have fewer iotc
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:15,360	| IOT193 |	Security incidents they've demonstrated
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:16,128	| IOT193 |	Mura Masa
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:20,736	| IOT193 |	Tree and iot security doing things like encryption authentication risk
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:22,784	| IOT193 |	Assessments there's middle class
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:24,064	| IOT193 |	The bottom
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:25,856	| IOT193 |	The bottom tier of Courts
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:28,672	| IOT193 |	For the organizations that are really struggling to get
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:29,184	| IOT193 |	How old am I
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:32,000	| IOT193 |	Security and to put those practices in place
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:34,560	| IOT193 |	So we're there big differences between the two
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:37,120	| IOT193 |	The results were surprising
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,144	| IOT193 |	So we have to respond
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:41,472	| IOT193 |	About iot related security incidents that they had a
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:42,240	| IOT193 |	Experience
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:43,776	| IOT193 |	The past 2 years
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:45,824	| IOT193 |	The difference between the top and the bottom
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:46,848	| IOT193 |	Here were a mistake
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:49,664	| IOT193 |	Of the bottom tier organizations
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:51,200	| IOT193 |	Every one of them
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:52,480	| IOT193 |	Reported that
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:53,248	| IOT193 |	Experienced
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:54,528	| IOT193 |	The security incident
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:57,344	| IOT193 |	Something like monetary damages or loss of product
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:40:58,880	| IOT193 |	70 compared to just
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:01,696	| IOT193 |	32% of the top-tier organizations
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:03,232	| IOT193 |	Experiencing an incident
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,792	| IOT193 |	Comedian shows that
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:09,888	| IOT193 |	The things the Topsy organizations are doing those things like encryption and I'll send it
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:10,656	| IOT193 |	Vacation
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:12,704	| IOT193 |	Risk assessment other devices
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:14,240	| IOT193 |	Those things are working
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:17,824	| IOT193 |	And they're leaving those organizations to be much better off
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:18,592	| IOT193 |	Okay
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:20,384	| IOT193 |	So let's talk about those on the bottom tier
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:22,432	| IOT193 |	What type of damages
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:22,944	| IOT193 |	Did they
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:24,736	| IOT193 |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:26,272	| IOT193 |	Most surprising was monetary.
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:27,808	| IOT193 |	25 /
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:30,368	| IOT193 |	Percent of the bottom tier reported iotc
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:31,136	| IOT193 |	Security lock
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:34,208	| IOT193 |	At least 34 million dollars in the last
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:34,976	| IOT193 |	2 years
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:37,024	| IOT193 |	And those range from
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:38,560	| IOT193 |	Monetary damages
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:39,328	| IOT193 |	Loss of Prada
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:40,096	| IOT193 |	Activity
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:41,888	| IOT193 |	Legal penalties that they're having
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:44,192	| IOT193 |	Pay and impact to their stock price
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:47,520	| IOT193 |	So where can we find out more about digicert and the results of
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:51,616	| IOT193 |	Our website is www.denniskirk.com
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:53,151	| IOT193 |	And there's a link there that
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:55,199	| IOT193 |	And take you to find more information about the survey
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:10,303	| IOT193 |	Everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Heather
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:11,583	| IOT193 |	Read Penske
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:15,423	| IOT193 |	Who is the CI to at the city of
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:17,983	| IOT193 |	Alder tree
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:22,591	| IOT193 |	I'm just Gray Station thanks awesome. I should tell u c i t o mean
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:26,687	| IOT193 |	Chief Information Technology officer which is a title I've never heard
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:27,967	| IOT193 |	Is that really common
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:30,527	| IOT193 |	I guess in Calgary or in this Municipal business
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:31,551	| IOT193 |	No I think it was
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:32,319	| IOT193 |	Just a combination
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:35,391	| IOT193 |	Heo so it
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:41,023	| IOT193 |	Takes a basketball to put them together or possibly just two jobs in one day
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:45,119	| IOT193 |	So the City of Calgary has deployed a Laura
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:47,935	| IOT193 |	Network and I thought this was really interesting because
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:50,751	| IOT193 |	One there not alot of city-owned Laura Networks
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:54,591	| IOT193 |	But I'm aware of so I want to talk about that and then you guys are doing some really cool
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:55,359	| IOT193 |	Cool things with it
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:57,407	| IOT193 |	So let's just start off with
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:59,455	| IOT193 |	Your approach to this networking
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:00,479	| IOT193 |	How this came to be
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:02,783	| IOT193 |	Sure and I have to go back in
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:03,807	| IOT193 |	In time because
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:06,111	| IOT193 |	And City of Calgary we've always had a vision
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:07,135	| IOT193 |	Turn around connected
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:08,927	| IOT193 |	City and. Started
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:09,695	| IOT193 |	You know more than
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:13,023	| IOT193 |	15 years ago and we've been building out communication
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:15,071	| IOT193 |	Structure to a fiber optic Network
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:17,119	| IOT193 |	18 years
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:19,167	| IOT193 |	We really saw that is the foundation
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:21,471	| IOT193 |	Send up Dan building a pond that
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:21,983	| IOT193 |	Forest Park
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:24,287	| IOT193 |	Obsidian to the Future
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:26,335	| IOT193 |	And innocent of knowing what was
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:27,103	| IOT193 |	Coming into
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:28,639	| IOT193 |	Future in terms of
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:30,943	| IOT193 |	Depot access devices building
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:32,223	| IOT193 |	Being connected
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:32,991	| IOT193 |	What that would
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:34,527	| IOT193 |	Mean for a city operation
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:36,063	| IOT193 |	Versailles
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,599	| IOT193 |	We wanted to make sure we had that Foundation
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:39,391	| IOT193 |	Spice so
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:41,439	| IOT193 |	We have used a fiber-optic Network
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:43,231	| IOT193 |	4
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:45,279	| IOT193 |	Carrier-grade Network which we built
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:45,791	| IOT193 |	In
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,839	| IOT193 |	Nickelback 2013
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:51,935	| IOT193 |	Which shirts all of our trip a product Network for the City of Calgary and all our offer
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:53,983	| IOT193 |	911
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:55,775	| IOT193 |	311

EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:59,615	| IOT193 |	And then from there we you
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:01,151	| IOT193 |	Use some of the infrastructure that we had
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:02,431	| IOT193 |	Play so we have
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:03,455	| IOT193 |	Radio towers
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:03,967	| IOT193 |	That we use
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:06,271	| IOT193 |	Responders for their Radio City
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:10,879	| IOT193 |	And wisdom tooth at Biltmore the last mile
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:13,951	| IOT193 |	Components of a fixed Wireless which helped us to get to a few
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:14,719	| IOT193 |	UCI
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:19,583	| IOT193 |	And then from there we challenged our innovation
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:24,191	| IOT193 |	Technology
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:25,215	| IOT193 |	To go about researching
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:31,103	| IOT193 |	Spell to do that
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:31,871	| IOT193 |	Awesome
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:34,175	| IOT193 |	It sounds like there's lots of things going over that Network
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:36,479	| IOT193 |	We can run many different services on it it's
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:39,807	| IOT193 |	260 City facilities
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:42,111	| IOT193 |	City operator
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:44,671	| IOT193 |	Is really important in our a lot
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:50,559	| IOT193 |	Has been that is a city we need our own private Network we be everywhere we
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:54,399	| IOT193 |	Sure we need it to be available for our first
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:55,167	| IOT193 |	Responders
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:57,215	| IOT193 |	MCC Public Safety situation
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:58,751	| IOT193 |	And that's always been
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:44:59,519	| IOT193 |	Our
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:00,287	| IOT193 |	Call Envision
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:02,847	| IOT193 |	So why did you choose Laura
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:06,687	| IOT193 |	When they're kind of some other proprietary Technologies out there there's the
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:09,759	| IOT193 |	The cellular stuff was it part of the being city-owned aspect
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:13,599	| IOT193 |	No it was just our team really analyzed
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:14,623	| IOT193 |	They reviewed
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:16,671	| IOT193 |	Lora technology and
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:18,463	| IOT193 |	It really felt it had some of
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:19,231	| IOT193 |	Advantages
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:23,583	| IOT193 |	Security functionality the implementation and operating cost
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:26,911	| IOT193 |	The real ability to have
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:27,935	| IOT193 |	True that coverage
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:28,959	| IOT193 |	Performance
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:31,263	| IOT193 |	And
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:32,543	| IOT193 |	Knology
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:34,335	| IOT193 |	One picture they have flexibility and better
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:36,895	| IOT193 |	The system that was
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:37,663	| IOT193 |	The technology
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:39,967	| IOT193 |	She that they decided on and started to
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:41,503	| IOT193 |	To install
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:42,527	| IOT193 |	Radios on
EDL	00:45:42,527	00:45:45,855	| IOT193 |	Some of our radio towers and were able to get pretty much the whole
EDL	00:45:45,855	00:45:46,623	| IOT193 |	Geographic area
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:53,535	| IOT193 |	Cool okay so you guys were doing Smart City before it was even cool it sounds like
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:54,047	| IOT193 |	I like to see
EDL	00:45:57,119	00:45:58,399	| IOT193 |	You got it
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:00,191	| IOT193 |	Lot of stuff happened in their soul
EDL	00:46:00,191	00:46:05,055	| IOT193 |	Talk about some of the newer things that you guys are doing I was most excited
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:05,823	| IOT193 |	I think because
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:06,591	| IOT193 |	Sounded
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:08,639	| IOT193 |	Really beautiful and also complex
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:10,943	| IOT193 |	This devonian Gardens
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:11,711	| IOT193 |	You guys
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:14,015	| IOT193 |	Haven't you should probably tell us what that is first
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:15,551	| IOT193 |	And I will talk about what you've done
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:17,343	| IOT193 |	Devonian Gardens
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:19,391	| IOT193 |	Is the three-acre
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:20,159	| IOT193 |	Like this
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:21,183	| IOT193 |	Peaceful Refuge
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:23,231	| IOT193 |	Depends on the top of the shopping
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:24,767	| IOT193 |	It's one of the largest
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:28,095	| IOT193 |	Indoor gardens of its kind and it was more than
EDL	00:46:28,095	00:46:29,631	| IOT193 |	10000 ground cover plants
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:35,263	| IOT193 |	Square foot living wall pond
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:36,543	| IOT193 |	Children's play area
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:38,591	| IOT193 |	I really kind of this Oasis
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:39,871	| IOT193 |	Stat targaryens
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:41,151	| IOT193 |	Go to in the middle of
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:41,663	| IOT193 |	The downtown
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:43,199	| IOT193 |	It's really impressive
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:46,271	| IOT193 |	Space has imported exotic plants
EDL	00:46:46,271	00:46:47,295	| IOT193 |	Tropical trees
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:50,623	| IOT193 |	And it's really been
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:57,535	| IOT193 |	We go through so there really precious asset that are in this Garden
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:03,423	| IOT193 |	This unit for the main challenge for them is creating that healthy environment
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:04,191	| IOT193 |	Or all of the
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:06,239	| IOT193 |	And all these
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:07,007	| IOT193 |	Tropical
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:07,775	| IOT193 |	Interior plant
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:14,687	| IOT193 |	These tropical plants life is hard for them in the middle of Calgary even if it is a nice and close to area so it's
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:17,503	| IOT193 |	It sounds like you guys built out a sensor Network
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:18,527	| IOT193 |	Work in
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:19,039	| IOT193 |	Curious
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:21,855	| IOT193 |	So the sensor networks measure soil moisture at measure
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:23,647	| IOT193 |	Late for these plans
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:26,207	| IOT193 |	And there's a feedback loop this getting built
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:26,975	| IOT193 |	What does it look like
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:29,023	| IOT193 |	Build something like that
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:31,327	| IOT193 |	And how do you make it economical for the city
EDL	00:47:31,327	00:47:32,863	| IOT193 |	I think the main thing for us
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:34,143	| IOT193 |	Because we already have the
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:35,423	| IOT193 |	Infrastructure in place
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:36,959	| IOT193 |	Having that foundation in
EDL	00:47:36,959	00:47:38,495	| IOT193 |	Place it was absolute
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:40,287	| IOT193 |	Will be Paramount for us being able to
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:42,591	| IOT193 |	Launcher dorwin Network
EDL	00:47:42,591	00:47:44,127	| IOT193 |	Write in a lure when Network
EDL	00:47:44,127	00:47:45,919	| IOT193 |	She'll really was not that it's
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:46,687	| IOT193 |	Expensive
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:47,711	| IOT193 |	Cuz we had that sound
EDL	00:47:48,223	00:47:51,551	| IOT193 |	Place so we spent about 45 K on radio
EDL	00:47:52,063	00:47:53,343	| IOT193 |	To be able to have the network
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:54,111	| IOT193 |	And then
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:47:56,671	| IOT193 |	Writing about it
EDL	00:47:56,671	00:47:58,463	| IOT193 |	Software platform tools that were you
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:47:59,999	| IOT193 |	Collect the data
EDL	00:47:59,999	00:48:02,559	| IOT193 |	For the team itself there really are innovation
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:03,071	| IOT193 |	Operation
EDL	00:48:04,863	00:48:06,143	| IOT193 |	Citgo in try again
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:06,655	| IOT193 |	Products
EDL	00:48:07,167	00:48:08,447	| IOT193 |	You know they were crate closed
EDL	00:48:08,447	00:48:09,471	| IOT193 |	See with our local
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:11,007	| IOT193 |	University here and
EDL	00:48:11,007	00:48:13,055	| IOT193 |	Next race in the field as well Jacob
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:13,567	| IOT193 |	My GF
EDL	00:48:14,079	00:48:17,663	| IOT193 |	The main Center they were looking for was a soil Monitoring Center
EDL	00:48:17,663	00:48:18,943	| IOT193 |	To measure the water content
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:22,015	| IOT193 |	And at some of the Electra
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:25,343	| IOT193 |	Conductivity in the soil as well and so that way they
EDL	00:48:25,343	00:48:28,671	| IOT193 |	Some kind of the understand the irrigation performance against the required
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:30,463	| IOT193 |	Plants
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:32,511	| IOT193 |	And that's where it's really helping our
EDL	00:48:34,559	00:48:36,607	| IOT193 |	You know what they should be doing and how they
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:37,887	| IOT193 |	Watering plants
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:39,423	| IOT193 |	In that area or anybody
EDL	00:48:40,703	00:48:43,007	| IOT193 |	The light the temperature is required to keep
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:43,775	| IOT193 |	Keep some of those
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:44,799	| IOT193 |	Exotic plants
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:47,103	| IOT193 |	Healthy so how does something like this
EDL	00:48:47,103	00:48:48,639	| IOT193 |	Change the job
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:51,455	| IOT193 |	Of the staff in the gardens are they
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:55,039	| IOT193 |	Now responsible for the censored networks are they still doing
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:57,855	| IOT193 |	Like I just trying to think about once we add this
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:48:58,623	| IOT193 |	This type of connect
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:49:02,975	| IOT193 |	Activity and get more information out of things a lot of times that changes the job just
EDL	00:49:02,975	00:49:03,999	| IOT193 |	Descriptions of some of the people
EDL	00:49:04,767	00:49:05,535	| IOT193 |	The stuff
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:10,655	| IOT193 |	I think this is an evolving thing I know it is in our organization is that Evolution around
EDL	00:49:11,167	00:49:12,191	| IOT193 |	Havana lyrics
EDL	00:49:12,191	00:49:17,823	| IOT193 |	And yeah really making sure that in an organization we are training
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:19,359	| IOT193 |	People in that area
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:24,223	| IOT193 |	And then I think an area like devonian its they could be much more precise
EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:25,503	| IOT193 |	About the work that they're doing
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:30,111	| IOT193 |	Very very much more precise
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:35,231	| IOT193 |	Excellent okay well let's move to you guys have also in addition to
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:38,047	| IOT193 |	Hopefully making it easier and healthier for your plants
EDL	00:49:38,047	00:49:39,071	| IOT193 |	You've also
EDL	00:49:39,071	00:49:39,839	| IOT193 |	Done
EDL	00:49:39,839	00:49:44,703	| IOT193 |	Project with noise pollution and understanding kind of the acoustic profile of you
EDL	00:49:45,215	00:49:49,567	| IOT193 |	I'd love to hear more about that and what does that entail and how much of the city does
EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:54,943	| IOT193 |	Yeah we just done and most of these cases for tubing in Pilot mode and
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:55,711	| IOT193 |	We really
EDL	00:49:55,711	00:49:57,503	| IOT193 |	To be honest with you wanted to try
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:59,295	| IOT193 |	Some Pilots were they weren't
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:01,855	| IOT193 |	They weren't going to
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:04,927	| IOT193 |	Impact and essential service necessarily right
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:11,327	| IOT193 |	Turn the noise pollution and I think there's a few cities that are looking at how they monitor noise and
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:14,911	| IOT193 |	I think one of the goals is really to get to what's the type of noise
EDL	00:50:14,911	00:50:15,935	| IOT193 |	As well
EDL	00:50:15,935	00:50:17,727	| IOT193 |	Cuz I can help in terms of
EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:18,751	| IOT193 |	You know what kind of
EDL	00:50:18,751	00:50:21,823	| IOT193 |	Services are operations need to respond if there is something
EDL	00:50:21,823	00:50:22,847	| IOT193 |	Teenager happy
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:24,127	| IOT193 |	City project
EDL	00:50:24,127	00:50:27,199	| IOT193 |	Noise monitoring with a partnership
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:27,967	| IOT193 |	With
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:34,111	| IOT193 |	University of Calgary so between the City of Calgary in the University of Calgary we have the program called the urban.
EDL	00:50:34,879	00:50:36,415	| IOT193 |	Where you know if we have
EDL	00:50:36,927	00:50:37,951	| IOT193 |	Knee problems that we're trying
EDL	00:50:38,975	00:50:39,999	| IOT193 |	Thank you
EDL	00:50:39,999	00:50:40,767	| IOT193 |	She might be
EDL	00:50:40,767	00:50:41,535	| IOT193 |	How fast
EDL	00:50:41,535	00:50:44,607	| IOT193 |	Ravens put those on the table of the UFC have some research
EDL	00:50:45,887	00:50:47,167	| IOT193 |	To conduct and it would like
EDL	00:50:47,167	00:50:48,191	| IOT193 |	Real time
EDL	00:50:48,191	00:50:48,959	| IOT193 |	Problems
EDL	00:50:48,959	00:50:49,727	| IOT193 |	Access
EDL	00:50:50,239	00:50:51,263	| IOT193 |	Some of our facility
EDL	00:50:51,263	00:50:52,031	| IOT193 |	Networks
EDL	00:50:52,031	00:50:53,823	| IOT193 |	That they're able to do that too
EDL	00:50:53,823	00:50:55,359	| IOT193 |	So it becomes a partnership
EDL	00:50:55,871	00:50:58,687	| IOT193 |	Some of these research projects
EDL	00:50:58,687	00:51:00,991	| IOT193 |	Umbrella so we worked with a robotics
EDL	00:51:01,503	00:51:02,527	| IOT193 |	Central Network group
EDL	00:51:02,527	00:51:04,575	| IOT193 |	Out of the Department of electrical and
EDL	00:51:04,575	00:51:06,111	| IOT193 |	Computer Engineering at UC
EDL	00:51:06,111	00:51:07,647	| IOT193 |	And they really collaborated to help
EDL	00:51:08,159	00:51:09,183	| IOT193 |	Should have built this
EDL	00:51:09,183	00:51:10,207	| IOT193 |	Sensor
EDL	00:51:10,207	00:51:11,743	| IOT193 |	To initiate this pilot
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:14,815	| IOT193 |	She tried it on a
EDL	00:51:14,815	00:51:16,607	| IOT193 |	We have different sites
EDL	00:51:16,607	00:51:17,887	| IOT193 |	Weather Sebastopol
EDL	00:51:19,167	00:51:20,447	| IOT193 |	Typically where we get
EDL	00:51:20,447	00:51:26,591	| IOT193 |	Complaints from citizens who live nearby about noise and we also have new ordinances bylaws
EDL	00:51:28,639	00:51:31,455	| IOT193 |	They wanted to have an ability
EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:31,967	| IOT193 |	To be able to
EDL	00:51:32,479	00:51:34,271	| IOT193 |	Understand what the noise level was
EDL	00:51:34,271	00:51:36,319	| IOT193 |	I think in the future again
EDL	00:51:36,319	00:51:37,599	| IOT193 |	Precision
EDL	00:51:38,111	00:51:39,135	| IOT193 |	Why do we need
EDL	00:51:39,135	00:51:42,463	| IOT193 |	Send Paula out there if we can actually get to the place where we
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:45,791	| IOT193 |	Distinguish the type of noise it is
EDL	00:51:46,303	00:51:48,863	| IOT193 |	I need to be able to have onboard so they use
EDL	00:51:49,375	00:51:53,471	| IOT193 |	EBay sensors and they were placed at a carnival
EDL	00:51:53,471	00:51:55,263	| IOT193 |	Circle Carnival actually can't remember what
EDL	00:51:56,799	00:51:57,823	| IOT193 |	That played
EDL	00:51:57,823	00:51:58,847	| IOT193 |	Apartments
EDL	00:51:58,847	00:52:00,639	| IOT193 |	September and the senses were programmed
EDL	00:52:01,919	00:52:03,455	| IOT193 |	Noise level over a window
EDL	00:52:03,455	00:52:03,967	| IOT193 |	3 minutes
EDL	00:52:05,759	00:52:07,807	| IOT193 |	The noise of a rose above
EDL	00:52:07,807	00:52:09,599	| IOT193 |	E85 gas
EDL	00:52:09,599	00:52:11,135	| IOT193 |	This actress sent a warning packet
EDL	00:52:11,647	00:52:13,951	| IOT193 |	Through the lorwyn protocol and then
EDL	00:52:15,487	00:52:16,767	| IOT193 |	Provided to concert promoters
EDL	00:52:17,279	00:52:18,815	| IOT193 |	Sure
EDL	00:52:18,815	00:52:20,095	| IOT193 |	You in the future is that
EDL	00:52:20,095	00:52:21,631	| IOT193 |	Get that feedback to the car
EDL	00:52:21,631	00:52:22,399	| IOT193 |	Promoters
EDL	00:52:22,399	00:52:23,423	| IOT193 |	To ensure the noise
EDL	00:52:24,447	00:52:25,215	| IOT193 |	Compliance
EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:29,823	| IOT193 |	So it was that happening in real-time so you can get like an alert on your phone and be like
EDL	00:52:30,847	00:52:36,223	| IOT193 |	It was it was in the pilot we didn't quite have the connection where we were then saying
EDL	00:52:36,223	00:52:36,991	| IOT193 |	Hey mister concert
EDL	00:52:38,015	00:52:43,391	| IOT193 |	What's happening right now at your Festival
EDL	00:52:43,903	00:52:45,183	| IOT193 |	Use cases going forward
EDL	00:52:46,207	00:52:48,255	| IOT193 |	Kids that get up having a bunch of it
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:49,535	| IOT193 |	Possible people who are
EDL	00:52:49,535	00:52:52,863	| IOT193 |	Sitting there with the noise monitors were able to send them alert
EDL	00:52:52,863	00:52:54,911	| IOT193 |	That say hey you're over the Bible
EDL	00:52:55,679	00:52:56,703	| IOT193 |	So noise
EDL	00:52:56,703	00:52:57,215	| IOT193 |	Sensors
EDL	00:52:57,727	00:52:58,495	| IOT193 |	Have been
EDL	00:52:58,495	00:53:03,359	| IOT193 |	Somewhat controversial one because of the idea that they're recording all the time and that makes
EDL	00:53:03,359	00:53:04,383	| IOT193 |	People kind of uncomfortable
EDL	00:53:04,383	00:53:07,199	| IOT193 |	Comfortable like can they hear conversations we don't know
EDL	00:53:07,199	00:53:08,223	| IOT193 |	Some can some
EDL	00:53:08,223	00:53:10,271	| IOT193 |	Can't and then the other idea
EDL	00:53:10,271	00:53:12,575	| IOT193 |	I talked to somebody in the city of Busan
EDL	00:53:12,575	00:53:14,111	| IOT193 |	Korea and
EDL	00:53:14,111	00:53:20,511	| IOT193 |	They had an interesting problem where they did noise profiles in the city and in areas that were louder than
EDL	00:53:20,511	00:53:21,279	| IOT193 |	Then others
EDL	00:53:21,279	00:53:23,583	| IOT193 |	They publish the state on their website in the
EDL	00:53:23,583	00:53:26,143	| IOT193 |	Citizens got upset cuz their property values were
EDL	00:53:26,143	00:53:27,423	| IOT193 |	Declining is what they
EDL	00:53:27,423	00:53:31,263	| IOT193 |	Said and I thought that was really interesting and doosan decided not to publicly
EDL	00:53:31,263	00:53:33,823	| IOT193 |	Publish this data anymore in the website as a result
EDL	00:53:33,823	00:53:35,871	| IOT193 |	How to bet but there's so many
EDL	00:53:35,871	00:53:38,431	| IOT193 |	Unintended consequences so can you address
EDL	00:53:38,431	00:53:39,199	| IOT193 |	First off
EDL	00:53:39,199	00:53:39,711	| IOT193 |	Privacy
EDL	00:53:40,223	00:53:44,063	| IOT193 |	Are you recording all the time and then to talk about maybe potential unintended consequence
EDL	00:53:44,831	00:53:50,975	| IOT193 |	Yeah I like your question cuz it's something that we think about quite a bit and it needs use cases I said they're fairly
EDL	00:53:50,975	00:53:51,487	| IOT193 |	Contain
EDL	00:53:52,511	00:53:53,279	| IOT193 |	Not in
EDL	00:53:53,791	00:53:54,559	| IOT193 |	Critical
EDL	00:53:54,559	00:53:55,327	| IOT193 |	Operation
EDL	00:53:55,327	00:53:57,119	| IOT193 |	The whole idea of pride
EDL	00:53:57,119	00:54:00,959	| IOT193 |	Is she and where we're heading in a world of sensors I think it's something
EDL	00:54:00,959	00:54:04,031	| IOT193 |	Cities as we are deploying the
EDL	00:54:04,031	00:54:07,103	| IOT193 |	Sperone operations we have to make sure we're not
EDL	00:54:07,103	00:54:08,639	| IOT193 |	No privacy for a citizen
EDL	00:54:09,407	00:54:11,199	| IOT193 |	Is Paramount and that were not
EDL	00:54:11,199	00:54:11,711	| IOT193 |	To your point
EDL	00:54:12,223	00:54:12,991	| IOT193 |	The hottinger
EDL	00:54:12,991	00:54:13,503	| IOT193 |	Unintended
EDL	00:54:14,271	00:54:20,159	| IOT193 |	Is I don't know for these ones I don't believe for the test that we did in this one Carnival it was to the level
EDL	00:54:20,159	00:54:21,439	| IOT193 |	Where you could get
EDL	00:54:21,439	00:54:22,719	| IOT193 |	No individual conversate
EDL	00:54:22,719	00:54:25,279	| IOT193 |	I think some of them value
EDL	00:54:25,279	00:54:26,303	| IOT193 |	Looking for it
EDL	00:54:26,303	00:54:27,327	| IOT193 |	You don't have comments
EDL	00:54:27,327	00:54:28,351	| IOT193 |	311 noise
EDL	00:54:28,351	00:54:29,375	| IOT193 |	So being able to
EDL	00:54:29,887	00:54:31,935	| IOT193 |	Karachi addressed some of those noises
EDL	00:54:31,935	00:54:33,471	| IOT193 |	Complaints may be one
EDL	00:54:33,471	00:54:34,239	| IOT193 |	Future
EDL	00:54:34,239	00:54:35,007	| IOT193 |	Use case
EDL	00:54:36,031	00:54:37,311	| IOT193 |	Support some of those
EDL	00:54:37,311	00:54:39,103	| IOT193 |	Noise bylaw violation
EDL	00:54:39,871	00:54:40,895	| IOT193 |	Some of that data
EDL	00:54:40,895	00:54:42,687	| IOT193 |	I have heard about
EDL	00:54:42,687	00:54:43,967	| IOT193 |	Not being able to
EDL	00:54:43,967	00:54:44,479	| IOT193 |	Lexus
EDL	00:54:44,991	00:54:46,527	| IOT193 |	Nowhere the noisiest part of the
EDL	00:54:46,527	00:54:49,087	| IOT193 |	I'm really glad that you shared that
EDL	00:54:49,087	00:54:52,671	| IOT193 |	Example cuz those are some of the things we really need to think about you
EDL	00:54:52,671	00:54:53,695	| IOT193 |	Impacts of that kind of
EDL	00:54:54,207	00:54:55,487	| IOT193 |	Could be or the employee
EDL	00:54:56,511	00:55:01,375	| IOT193 |	Okay until you guys in Calgary because you've been doing this for so long so I feel like
EDL	00:55:01,375	00:55:02,655	| IOT193 |	You guys must have thought about this
EDL	00:55:02,655	00:55:03,679	| IOT193 |	Do you have
EDL	00:55:03,679	00:55:08,799	| IOT193 |	A digital infrastructure plan one of the challenges I think is municipalities
EDL	00:55:08,799	00:55:10,847	| IOT193 |	Start putting technology in places
EDL	00:55:10,847	00:55:15,455	| IOT193 |	They don't actually have a plan to make sure it all comes together in the end
EDL	00:55:15,455	00:55:16,735	| IOT193 |	So maybe they don't have like
EDL	00:55:16,735	00:55:18,527	| IOT193 |	Unified data schemes or
EDL	00:55:18,527	00:55:20,575	| IOT193 |	You know interoperability between vendors
EDL	00:55:20,575	00:55:21,343	| IOT193 |	So that's it
EDL	00:55:21,343	00:55:22,623	| IOT193 |	Technical side but then on the
EDL	00:55:22,623	00:55:24,671	| IOT193 |	Citizens side they don't actually have
EDL	00:55:24,671	00:55:26,463	| IOT193 |	Policies about privacy
EDL	00:55:26,463	00:55:28,255	| IOT193 |	Or how they're going to use the data
EDL	00:55:28,255	00:55:31,071	| IOT193 |	And I'm curious if you guys have built that
EDL	00:55:31,071	00:55:31,839	| IOT193 |	Already
EDL	00:55:31,839	00:55:35,935	| IOT193 |	And I would say because of the track I think we're all on his City's those
EDL	00:55:35,935	00:55:40,799	| IOT193 |	Strategies and need for some of those policies evolve right along the way
EDL	00:55:40,799	00:55:43,103	| IOT193 |	So yeah we've had a few different strategies
EDL	00:55:43,103	00:55:47,967	| IOT193 |	Things that work together we have a digital strategy where we really are focused
EDL	00:55:47,967	00:55:49,503	| IOT193 |	On Digital Services
EDL	00:55:50,015	00:55:53,087	| IOT193 |	Square citizens open data card.
EDL	00:55:53,087	00:55:54,367	| IOT193 |	Did holiday
EDL	00:55:54,367	00:55:55,647	| IOT193 |	And then we have another strategy
EDL	00:55:56,159	00:55:57,439	| IOT193 |	Which is more round
EDL	00:55:57,439	00:55:58,719	| IOT193 |	Information management
EDL	00:56:00,255	00:56:02,815	| IOT193 |	Right and how are using our data.
EDL	00:56:02,815	00:56:03,839	| IOT193 |	Privacy piece
EDL	00:56:03,839	00:56:05,119	| IOT193 |	Lisa's part of that
EDL	00:56:05,119	00:56:10,751	| IOT193 |	Yes for the processes that we go through before we have data out on our open data catalog
EDL	00:56:10,751	00:56:14,591	| IOT193 |	Legacy Challenge and if we move forward into this world
EDL	00:56:14,591	00:56:15,615	| IOT193 |	If we're trying to go
EDL	00:56:16,127	00:56:16,895	| IOT193 |	Slow
EDL	00:56:16,895	00:56:18,687	| IOT193 |	Enter learn from it
EDL	00:56:18,687	00:56:20,223	| IOT193 |	They'll be more that we need
EDL	00:56:20,223	00:56:21,247	| IOT193 |	To think about and can
EDL	00:56:21,247	00:56:23,039	| IOT193 |	Consider through some of those policies
EDL	00:56:25,087	00:56:26,623	| IOT193 |	So what is your neck
EDL	00:56:26,623	00:56:27,647	| IOT193 |	Spec project
EDL	00:56:27,647	00:56:28,927	| IOT193 |	For the Smart City going to be
EDL	00:56:29,439	00:56:30,463	| IOT193 |	You know we're at city that
EDL	00:56:30,975	00:56:31,487	| IOT193 |	Foothills
EDL	00:56:31,999	00:56:33,535	| IOT193 |	The Prairies in the mountains
EDL	00:56:33,535	00:56:35,839	| IOT193 |	Planting trees in urban canopy is
EDL	00:56:35,839	00:56:36,351	| IOT193 |	Really really
EDL	00:56:38,399	00:56:39,167	| IOT193 |	Golem strategy
EDL	00:56:40,703	00:56:45,823	| IOT193 |	Until recently we really didn't have a Dependable way or measurable way
EDL	00:56:45,823	00:56:47,359	| IOT193 |	Confirm that the teacher
EDL	00:56:48,639	00:56:49,407	| IOT193 |	Water
EDL	00:56:49,407	00:56:50,687	| IOT193 |	At the correct interval
EDL	00:56:50,687	00:56:52,223	| IOT193 |	So we worked our parks
EDL	00:56:52,223	00:56:53,503	| IOT193 |	Apartment 2
EDL	00:56:53,503	00:56:56,575	| IOT193 |	And idea to have a water flow sensor
EDL	00:56:57,599	00:56:58,623	| IOT193 |	Already have
EDL	00:56:58,623	00:57:00,159	| IOT193 |	Portable GPS
EDL	00:57:00,159	00:57:01,183	| IOT193 |	Cellular modem
EDL	00:57:01,183	00:57:01,951	| IOT193 |	In there
EDL	00:57:01,951	00:57:03,231	| IOT193 |	Which gives that wireless
EDL	00:57:03,743	00:57:04,767	| IOT193 |	Activity
EDL	00:57:04,767	00:57:05,791	| IOT193 |	Potato flour
EDL	00:57:05,791	00:57:08,095	| IOT193 |	And Daddy was simple but
EDL	00:57:08,095	00:57:08,863	| IOT193 |	It was complicated
EDL	00:57:09,375	00:57:10,143	| IOT193 |	Haswell
EDL	00:57:10,143	00:57:11,167	| IOT193 |	And to what we
EDL	00:57:11,167	00:57:13,215	| IOT193 |	We did is we actually have
EDL	00:57:13,215	00:57:15,775	| IOT193 |	Watering trucks that now having industrial-grade
